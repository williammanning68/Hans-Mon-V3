The Speaker, Ms O'Byrne, took the Chair at 10.00 a.m., acknowledged the Traditional People, and read Prayers.


RECOGNITION OF VISITORS

The SPEAKER - We have a guest in the gallery I would like to acknowledge, the honourable Warwick Smith AO. Thank you very much for spending some time joining us today, Warwick. It is good to see you. 

Members - Hear, hear.

The SPEAKER - I will talk about the kids in the gallery when I need you all to be calm.


QUESTIONS

Energy - Transmission Costs for Major Industrials

Mr WINTER question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

[10.01 a.m.]
It is no secret that some of Tasmania's largest businesses are facing serious challenges. The collapse of Whyalla steelworks and concerns about the future of the entire GFG Alliance has left some 300 Tasmanian employees employed at Liberty Bell Bay extremely concerned for their future. Can you confirm that your government increased energy transmission costs across our four major industrials by nearly 20 per cent this financial year and is set to increase them by more than 10 per cent this coming year? Why are you and your energy policy pushing these proud Tasmanian businesses up against the wall?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question and I am pleased to speak to it. As Tasmania grows, our need for more energy grows. There is no secret about that, and this government is leaning into that space like no others. It was our government that legislated the Tasmanian renewable energy target to double on-island renewable energy by 2040, setting the foundation for what needs to be done. It was our government that put in train the Renewal Energy Action Plan, the Renewable Hydrogen Action Plan and our 2030 Strong Plan -

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45. We only have three minutes - I ask the minister to come back to the question, which is about Liberty Bell Bay, a major industrial in his electorate. Can he come back to that, please?

The SPEAKER - It was a question without much preamble, minister.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, members on my left. I can make the ruling without your assistance. It was a specific question without much preamble, so I will draw you to the question, minister.

Mr DUIGAN - We are delivering the lowest energy prices of any state in the country, an outcome that continues to be confirmed by the Independent Regulator, with Tasmania having the lowest regulated price for energy of any state in the country.

We have reissued ministerial expectations to our energy businesses, TasNetworks among them, reinforcing a focus on lowest possible prices and supporting our economy. The major industrials you mention are an important aspect of that economy and the jobs they provide. We have asked Hydro Tasmania to prioritise delivering energy certainty to those businesses through the course of time. I am very pleased to announce that Liberty at Bell Bay has struck a new energy deal with Hydro on commercial terms going forward. It is important we get that on the record.

It is fascinating, Mr Winter, that you would raise this issue, given your call last year for the North West Transmission Developments Stage 1 and Stage 2 to be built in its entirety without delay -

Mr Winter - You are against it again.

Mr DUIGAN - and I would be fascinated to know what that would mean for energy transmission prices in the state of Tasmania and I think the businesses would be fascinated to know as well.

Members interjecting.  

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order. The minister has 17 seconds to address the question.

Mr DUIGAN - I am absolutely addressing the question, Speaker, in terms of what the Leader of the Opposition has proposed by way of -

The SPEAKER - The minister's time has expired. 

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - The question was: can the minister confirm his government has increased energy transmission costs across the four major industrials by nearly 20 per cent this financial year and is set to increase them again next financial year by nearly 10 per cent?

The SPEAKER - The supplementary is in order, as was the original question. I will draw the minister to the question.

Mr DUIGAN - That is still, I suspect, well below the 65 per cent that energy prices rose last time Labor had control of the levers. It was 65per cent under Labor and a measured, consistent important energy agenda for this state. You need to decide - 

Ms Finlay - You are pushing them to the wall, the one lever you have in Tasmania.

Mr DUIGAN - Ms Finlay, I assume you have your 'No Marinus' stickers next to your 'No Stadium' stickers in your office. What we are doing here is an ambitious energy agenda that supports those businesses that delivers cheaper energy -

Members interjecting.  

The SPEAKER - The member for Bass can stop interjecting. The minister can stop inciting those interjections. Continue with the answer.

Mr DUIGAN - That is what we are committed to on this side of the House.


Energy - Liberty Bell Bay

Mr WINTER question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

[10.06 a.m.]
The Minister for Energy has just confirmed that his government is increasing power prices for our major industrials by 20 per cent on transmission costs this financial year. Is your decision to impose these massive increases on energy transmission costs on our major industrials making a tough situation for them even tougher? 

Can you confirm that Liberty Bell Bay is not operating one of its furnaces and operating at 15 to 20 per cent below capacity? Can you also confirm that contractors for Liberty Bell Bay have been stood down? Can you confirm that you are jacking up these energy costs at such a difficult time? Can you also outline any conversations you have had with the business since the Whyalla Steelworks issues early this year?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. As I have said and will continue to say, Tasmania needs more on-island energy generation to meet our growing needs.

Ms Finlay - If only you can deliver it.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass.

Mr DUIGAN - We are heavily leaning into that. As you would be fascinated to learn, Hydro Tasmania signing a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Connorville solar farm, Ms Finlay, the fourth largest generator in this state, and we are pleased to be partnering -

Ms Finlay - What have you had to do with that? It is a private project.

Mr DUIGAN - through the work that we have done by turning Hydro Tasmania to its mind to bring on more generation in Tasmania.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass, I appreciate the emotion of this one, but I need you to be silent.

Mr DUIGAN - You mentioned aspects of Liberty Bell Bay. We, as a government, are prioritising power supply for our major industrials so that they can contract at commercial terms, as you would expect, to protect not only the jobs that are in those businesses, but also the people of Tasmania who expect a reasonable return on their energy assets. I am pleased that Liberty Bell Bay and Hydro Tasmania have come together to sign a long-term energy deal at commercial terms, which is hugely important.

My expectation is that Hydro, because that is the area of influence that I have - my colleague minister, Mr Abetz, will spend time working and understanding the business -

Mr WINTER - Honourable Speaker, point of order, Standing Order 45, to relevance. I am keen to get an answer. Can the minister confirm Liberty Bell Bay is operating without one of its furnaces and operating at 15 to 20 per cent below capacity? Can you also confirm contractors at Liberty Bell Bay -

The SPEAKER - It is not an opportunity to restate the question, but I will draw the minister to the question - 

Mr ABETZ - On a point of order, Speaker. That question that has been asked is clearly not in the Energy minister's portfolio.

The SPEAKER - That is not my problem. That is the problem of the minister who refused to then send it on to you. The minister could have referred the original question to you. He chose not to; therefore, I will call him to the answer.

Mr DUIGAN - As the Minister for Energy, I will happily answer the question as I feel it applies to me. That is that Hydro Tasmania, as the generator in Tasmania, has struck commercial terms with Liberty Bell Bay for a long-term power contract that both parties are happy with.

Ms Finlay - Is that right?

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass.

Mr DUIGAN - That is how a commercial contract works.

Mr Ellis - Willing participants on both sides of the contract.

The SPEAKER - Neither will you, Mr Ellis.

Mr DUIGAN - Both parties signed the contract, I believe, Ms Finlay. Despite your politicking and despite your running around trying to light fires, that is where we arrived at - a positive outcome, and we are very pleased.

Ms Finlay - People are trying to put out your fires, minister.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass.

Mr DUIGAN - Your question speaks very much to the operational aspects -

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - Before I call the supplementary, I will remind the minister to direct his answers through the Chair, which might stop the interjections. I also remind members that interjections are unparliamentary.

Mr WINTER - In my original question, I asked the minister when the last time he met with Liberty Bell Bay was to understand these issues. He does not appear to know much about it. Has he met with the company? When was the last time he met with them?

The SPEAKER - That was the original question, so the supplementary is in order. I will call the minister to that question.

Mr DUIGAN - Yes, I meet with Liberty Bell Bay, given it is in my electorate at Bell Bay, on a regular basis. My understanding from those discussions is that the issues principally being faced by Liberty Bell Bay are around ore supply rather than energy supply or price, or anything in that space -

Ms Finlay - When was the last time you met with them?

The SPEAKER - The member for Bass is warned.

Mr DUIGAN - If it becomes an issue that Liberty Bell Bay want to speak to the government about energy, I am very happy to have those discussions.

Mr WINTER - Point of order, honourable Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The question specifically to the minister was when was the last time you met with Liberty Bell Bay?

The SPEAKER - I will call the minister to that part of the question. You have 16 seconds left to answer.

Mr DUIGAN - I meet with Liberty Bell Bay on a regular basis.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Enabling Legislation

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.11 a.m.]
It is clear from what we heard yesterday that this parliament will shortly see special enabling legislation for your stadium, just like the Gunns pulp mill. Even Paul Lennon did not ram through an approval for his dodgy, divisive and polluting process. We have already seen your government produce special approval legislation for a shopping centre, but this is a massive, billion-dollar stadium that dwarfs the capital city that the majority of Tasmanians do not want, and it is not just a supermarket.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, members on my right.

Dr WOODRUFF - Given the timeframe you signed the state up to with the AFL, will you today confirm that the special legislation you intend parliament to vote on will be in the form of an approval or a permit - a rubber stamp, in other words, without any planning advice to support it at all?

ANSWER

I thank the member for her question and considerable interest in this matter, which is clear. We are 100 per cent always supportive of our own AFL team, and if there is no Macquarie Point Stadium, there is no team - that is very clear.

You have raised Paul Lennon, and I have seen the mug shots with my face and Paul's moe on it.

Dr Woodruff - Look at how that worked out for him.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The Leader of the Greens has asked her question. The Premier will address the question. I remind members that when we are referring to former members, to do so with the level of respect that any former member of the House deserves.

Mr ROCKLIFF - In saying that, you have mentioned Mr Lennon. At least you knew where Mr Lennon stood on major projects in Tasmania, and I respect him for that, unlike the current Labor leader. We do not know where they stand on anything. It was only a couple of years ago we did not know where they stood on Marinus even - for years in fact. On the stadium they have been flip-flopping all over the place and continue to do so; so much so they were too scared to front the media yesterday.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order.

Dr WOODRUFF - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance.
Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Dr WOODRUFF - Can the Premier address the issue of what he is planning to bring into parliament and what form that would be in?

The SPEAKER - Thank you. The question was reasonably specific, Premier, so I will draw you to it if I can.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you very much, honourable Speaker. I made it very clear yesterday that parliament will be the final arbiter of this project. We are going through a process.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The leader of government business and the Deputy Leader of the Greens will hear the answer in silence or go outside, because I do not have any tolerance for this today.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I do not know why the Leader of the Greens does not trust parliament to make these decisions. We have a Project of State Significance (POSS) process we are undergoing. We have an issues paper being presented by the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) on Monday and we are working through those issues. Why would we not?

In certain areas, I found the issues paper quite perplexing, to be honest. For instance, on page 42 it says:

The panel considers there is little to no empirical evidence that a stadium and the events it hosts lead to increases in sport participation or associated physical and mental health benefits.

I found it really perplexing, because when I go to the MyState Arena and the investment that we have made there -

The SPEAKER - The time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - The Premier said that the parliament will be the final arbiter. He did not answer the question that I asked: is he planning on bringing legislation in that would be a permit or a rubber stamp approval process?

The SPEAKER - The question is in order because it is both the original question and arises from the Premier's contribution.

Dr Woodruff - Will you see the POSS through?

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Leader of the Greens. I do not want to have to warn you as well.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you. I will come to the question in just a moment. I find perplexing matters throughout the report, such as the quote that I have just read out there. I see growth in basketball, young kids picking up basketballs, putting down their mobile phones, playing sport.

Dr Woodruff - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. There is only a minute -

The SPEAKER - You have to seek the call, which I am now giving you, and then you can make your point of order.

Dr WOODRUFF - Standing Order 45, relevance.

The SPEAKER - Indeed. I will call the Premier on relevance.

Dr Woodruff - The Premier has only one minute.

The SPEAKER - I have called the Premier on relevance. Premier, you have 25 seconds to address the supplementary question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I will -

Dr Woodruff - Will you see the POSS process through?

Mr ROCKLIFF - What I am saying is that there is an example that needs scrutiny in terms of what the TPC has put forward - again, a little perplexing. We are going through a process, where people will have submissions to the draft -

Dr Woodruff - What are you going to do?

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Mr ROCKLIFF - to the issues paper. We are working through the planning process now -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.


Health Budget - Efficiency Dividends

Mr O'BYRNE question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

[10.18 a.m.]
One of the methods your government has chosen to address the state's budget woes is the blunt instrument of efficiency dividends across agencies. This is unstrategic and it rarely, if ever, achieves the desired outcomes. It sends managers scrambling to save a dollar wherever they can, often to no avail and to the detriment of frontline staff.

I have been informed that the Department of Health is restricting access to basics on the wards for both patients and workers. Milo, toast, and milk are no longer being provided to employees. Barriers are being put in place to order everyday items, and equipment now has to have a chief executive sign off on all non-food standard items. This includes simple things such as icy poles for patients, and workers even having to put in requisition orders for something like bottled water. Can you confirm that this is actually happening? Do you think having the CEO sign off on every water bottle is an effective and efficient way to save money?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I commit to the member that I will investigate what the member has stated today. I will provide a more fulsome response at the end of the day.

In regard to the Health budget, can I say that at the moment we are spending $12.9 billion over the forward Estimates. That works out to be $8.8 million a day. Health budget consumes 32 per cent of the state budget. We are not cutting back the budget for Health in regard to providing essential services for Tasmanians who need our health services right now. In fact, there is actually an extra $345 million in the revised Estimates report. We make no apologies for that, because it means we are delivering better care to more Tasmanians when and where they need it. We are investing in more staff, more doctors, more nurses and more paramedics. Since April we have employed an extra 2675 new staff.

In regard to what the member has stated about food services, I will endeavour to get back to him today with a more fulsome answer.

Recognition of Visitors – The Friends' School

The SPEAKER - Before giving the call, I acknowledge now in the Gallery the presence of some more of our year six students from I think Friends are spending quite a bit of time in the parliament this last bit of time. Thank you very much for joining us. I am sure you are loving democracy at work.

Macquarie Point Stadium - Dr Gruen Report

Mrs PENTLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.20 a.m.]
Last year, you commissioned Dr Nicholas Gruen to undertake an independent assessment of Macquarie Point Stadium. The report highlighted major challenges facing the project, but its findings were largely ignored by your government. Now it appears some pro-stadium forces are trying to undermine Dr Gruen's reputation with a No New Stadium website detailing a media story in the works. Is the government trying to discredit an economist whose work it does not agree with?


ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question, despite having some reservations around the report that Dr Gruen produced, as I have said with the TPC draft report. I have highlighted an example where they had a perplexing finding from my point of view - when you know stadium infrastructure [Bookmark: Phr4_O=47.3_D=19.7_C=0.63] , how can you take that it does not have benefits for people in terms of their physical and mental health wellbeing? 

You can take that to say we should not have any sporting grounds, or any investment when it comes to not only York Park, Penguin, Latrobe Recreation Ground or  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=67.4_D=27.1_C=0.80] school grounds. I find that really perplexing and it does not bear fruit when it comes to the clear and obvious example of MyState Bank Arena, where I see hundreds and hundreds of young kids excited about the basketball game, excited about one day being a JackJumper, having aspiration from supporting the team. The same thing can be put forward for  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=95.3_D=2.7_C=0.59] the Tasmanian Devils when there is such excitement  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=98.7_D=25.7_C=0.69] around the momentum. Now, Auskick has increased some - what did you say, Josh, the other day? 

Mr Willie - 100 per cent in the South.

Mr ROCKLIFF - 100 per cent, there you go.

The SPEAKER - All very helpful, but can we not call each other by our first names in the Chamber. Thank you.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We have some support for Auskick and AFL over there, which is welcome. It is a great example, and you would well know this. The participation and momentum is great. Last Friday there was a launch of the reintroduction of the East Devonport Football Club into the NWFL. It went into recess, if you like, and is now part of that competition again. John Febey and others have done a wonderful job in terms of  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=150.9_D=13.7_C=0.64] getting that club back on track, but I believe it is also to do with the momentum associated with the Tassie Devils and the grassroots impact that has - Ms Ogilvie, you are 100 per cent right.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=166.1_D=29.1_C=0.79] Dr Gruen has done his work. We have looked at the report. I disagree with aspects of the findings, just as I do not align with some aspects of the findings of the TPC issues paper as well but it is important that everyone has their say in this discussion. People can have their say right now quite clearly when it comes to responding to the issues paper of the TPC.  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=195.4_D=10.1_C=0.55] We have always welcomed debate in this area. We have never shied away from it, as tough as it has been.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=207.4_D=13.0_C=0.47] The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. 

Supplementary Question

The SPEAKER - Was that a supplementary, Mrs Pentland?

Mrs PENTLAND - Just back to the question: can you rule out that you are trying to discredit Dr Gruen via the media? 

The SPEAKER - That was quite a specific question, Premier. If you could just quickly address that.
 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=224.9_D=24.8_C=0.80] Mr ROCKLIFF - I do not actively work to discredit anyone. Everyone has a right to a say, so no is the answer to your question. I might disagree with points of view put forward by certain individuals in this discussion and debate, but I will argue the debate. I will argue the case on its merit and not through [Bookmark: Phr15_O=250.7_D=3.4_C=0.54]  any personal attacks. 


Energy – Liberty Bell Bay and Infrabuild

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=255.6_D=29.0_C=0.78] [10.25 a.m.]
Your Energy minister confirmed earlier that major industrials have seen transmission prices go up by almost 20 per cent this year, and he cannot say when the last time he met with Liberty Bell Bay was. The pressure goes up on those Liberty Bell Bay workers. Last night, it was revealed that InfraBuild, another major part of the GFG alliance with approximately 50 workers in Tasmania, is in trouble as well. They have had their credit rating downgraded by Fitch to CC, indicating that the ratings agency believes [Bookmark: Phr17_O=285.2_D=19.8_C=0.71]  a default appears probable within the next three months. I understand that late yesterday they missed a scheduled earnings call with bond holders for a fifth time. 

Are you concerned about the future for InfraBuild workers in Tasmania? Are you concerned about the potential impacts on Liberty Bell Bay given InfraBuild is a major customer, and if so, why is your government slugging them with massive power prices increases?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I reject the premise of the member's question, because these negotiations are hard fought, they are tough, but we find and settle on a position through sensible negotiation for the benefit of Tasmania as a whole. We will continue to do that. I am not going to get into your scare campaign and negative tactics, and thank goodness you are not in charge, because when there are tough decisions to be made, you run away as fast as you possibly can, just like how you would not go out there and front of the media yesterday -

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You can laugh all you like, but there is one thing - at least we have the courage of our own convictions on this side of the House, and we do not go to jelly like you do on that side of the House. We will work with all businesses. You have singled out some examples, but we are in the game of bringing people together. We support our industrial base; we support the workers in Bell Bay and in all small, medium and large businesses.

The minister pointed out how reckless your transmission policy is -

Mr Winter - What is that?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Good question. I thought you would have known what your policy was.

Members interjecting.
The SPEAKER - The House will come to order. I will draw the Premier to the question, thank you, and the House will come to order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - At the completion of Question Time, I can provide information to the House on Labor's policy if you would like.

Mr Winter - Point of order, Speaker, this question is about the future for 300 workers at Liberty Bell Bay. I thought the Premier would take this question somewhat seriously. Can he please answer the question?

The SPEAKER - It is not an opportunity to argue a case. If the point of order is relevance, I will draw the Premier to the question and interjections on both sides will cease. Premier, it is an important issue for people in the north.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Not only does the member go to jelly when it comes to some tough decisions, but he also has a glass jaw. Can I say we take these matters very seriously? As I said in the answer to this question, we work through these challenges -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ROCKLIFF - in a sensible and methodical way, negotiating to the benefit of both parties.

The SPEAKER - The time for answering has expired. 

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary.

Mr WINTER - I ask the same question again, and hopefully the Premier could have the decency to answer these questions for those workers. Is the Premier concerned about the future for InfraBuild workers in Tasmania? Is he concerned about the future impacts on Liberty Bell Bay given InfraBuild is a major customer? If so, why is this government slugging them with even higher power prices?

The SPEAKER - I will draw the Premier to the original question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Firstly, can I say we follow these matters very closely. Where were you -

Mr Winter - So closely, yet your Energy minister does not even meet with them?

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition, please do not make me warn you. You get some latitude, but it needs to stop.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Where were you mob when you slugged Tasmanians with a 65 per cent increase in power prices between 2010 -

Members interjecting.

Mr Willie - This is a pressing matter right now.

The SPEAKER - Shadow Treasurer; members for Lyons and Franklin.

Mr ROCKLIFF - All care, no responsibility. I will remind you that when there was a Labor-Greens Coalition, not only did 10,000 jobs go - 10,000 people to the dole queues under your watch - you also slugged them with a 65 per cent increase in power prices. That is exactly what you did. 

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering has expired. I will remind the Premier that the phrase 'you mob' is unparliamentary. He will refer to members on the other side by their proper titles.


Liberty Bell Bay - White Oak Global Advisers 

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.31 a.m.]
Hopefully, the Premier will take this question seriously. White Oak is a US vulture fund with a very chequered past. After seizing control of distressed data analytics businesses in 2018, White Oak was sued after its managers engaged in horrendous abuses of its workforce, including sexual harassment, racial harassment and disability discrimination. In a separate scandal in 2022, White Oak was forced to pay the New York State Nurses Association $96 million, following serious violations of worker pension protection laws.

Can you confirm that as a result of the problems in the GFG Alliance, White Oak has been given security over GFG's entire shareholding in Liberty Bell Bay? What are you going to do to ensure that a major longstanding Tasmanian business and the future of 300 Tasmanian workers does not fall into the hands of a US vulture fund?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, we will always be on the side of Tasmanian business. We have clearly demonstrated that, whether that be small, medium or large businesses, because we have created 50,000 jobs -

Mr Willie - What did the Tasmanian Chamber of Industry and Commerce say about you last year?

The SPEAKER - Shadow Treasurer, you are warned. You have to stop interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We have created 50,000 jobs over the course of the last decade. Our economy is now a $40 billion economy, or more. We are leading the nation in many economic indicators. For a population of 575,000 people, Tasmanians do extraordinarily well in partnership with their government of the day - in this case, the government over the course of the last 10 years. We have transformed Tasmania and turned this state around from a recession where we lost 10,000 jobs, power prices increased by 65 per cent -

Ms Finlay - There have been 8000 jobs lost since you have been Premier.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass.

Mr ROCKLIFF - they closed hospital wards, put beds in storage -

Ms Dow - You have 25 beds in storage at Scottsdale.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader.

Mr ROCKLIFF - They tried to close 20 schools around Tasmania. We are rebuilding schools around Tasmania.

The SPEAKER - The Premier will resume his seat. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is warned. I will hear the point of order from the Leader of the Opposition.

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 35, relevance. The question is quite specifically about Liberty Bell Bay. I hoped the Premier of Tasmania would show them the respect to answer the question about Liberty Bell Bay.

The SPEAKER - Premier, the point of order on relevance is upheld. It is a matter I am interested in as well, so I will call you to the question, please.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I recall a conversation with Mr Gupta himself a couple of weeks ago; an open engagement. I know that the Department of State Growth met with Liberty weekly to work through the circumstances that confront them. We are about building partnerships in Tasmania, across the community, across business and across industry. At the end of the day, through those discussions, we get the job done, but we will always stand up for Tasmanian industry. When those opposite were calling for a boycott on King Island cheese, we chose to save the dairy. That is how we operate.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The member for Bass has a second warning, the member for Franklin has a first, and minister Ogilvie will cease her interjections.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - You will get two warnings for that. You do not interject the moment you have had a warning. Sorry, I am taking this seriously. The House must come to order today. This is completely unacceptable.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - The Premier raised in his answer that he met with Mr Gupta, the chair of the GFG group. Can he explain to the House what arrangements he came to with Mr Gupta around the future of Liberty Bell Bay?

The SPEAKER - I will draw the Premier to it as it does come from the answer that he gave, recognising the limitations that may exist.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You would expect me to reach out to such an important employer when there has been national exposure to some of their associated challenges. Liberty Bell Bay is a very strategically important Tasmanian manufacturer and exporter, and a major employer of hundreds of local jobs. It spends heavily with Tasmanian suppliers and contributes nearly half a billion dollars to the economy each year. You would expect me as Premier to engage with such an important industry sector.

The government welcomes Liberty's new 10-year electricity deal with Hydro Tasmania, which was the subject of the phone call. Naturally, we are monitoring the Whyalla Steelworks administration process very closely, and maintaining contact with Liberty management and the federal government. Liberty Bell Bay is financially and legally separate from Whyalla and remains fully operational. 


Macquarie Point Stadium - Progression outside of Project of State Significance Process

Ms JOHNSTON question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.36 a.m.]
My question is to the Premier, and it is very simple. Premier, have you or your government asked, and/or have you or your government received advice about ways to progress your stadium outside of the POSS process? If so, will you table that advice?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I have not received advice. We are going through the Project of State Significance Process. That is the planning process. We are engaged in that. We welcome the report. We are sensibly working through the issues. People get the opportunity for submissions to the issues paper. We will work through the matters.

Mr Bayley - Have you sought advice?

The SPEAKER - It was not your question, Deputy Leader of the Greens.

Mr ROCKLIFF - What is important is that we work through these matters. We have set up a project of State Significance Process which gives parliament a second vote and the opportunity. That is sensible. I am sure that was welcomed by all and sundry. That is democracy.

Supplementary Question

Ms JOHNSTON - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary from the member for Clark.

Ms JOHNSTON - The Premier is indicating he has not received advice, but has the Premier asked for advice? Has the government asked for advice? 

The SPEAKER - That was the original question, Premier, and I will draw you to it.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I am considering all options, yes. Given the significance of this project for Tasmania and Tasmanians, yes, I have sought advice. Why would I not? We are committed to the process that we are going through now. At the end of the day - POSS process or enabling legislation - this parliament will have a say.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Enabling Legislation

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.38 a.m.]
You have made it very clear that you are planning special legislation. You deserve to give Tasmanians an answer about what you are actually doing. That special legislation - if it is in the form of an approval or permit - could be rushed through this House in a matter of days. Will you tell Tasmanians what you are planning to do with special legislation? Will it be in the form of a permit or an approval?

ANSWER

As I said, we are seeking advice. When you seek advice, advice comes back. Advice has not come back. What I am about is ensuring that we get this job done and we get a Tasmanian team in the AFL and AFLW. That is why I have been so committed to this project. That is why Tasmanians fully know where I stand on this project, and have done from day one. That is why we are showing courage and conviction on this side of the House. That is why we are.

For all the criticisms and the correlation with the former premier, Paul Lennon, whatever you thought of Mr Lennon, you knew where he stood on issues. I am the same. We will reach in and get this job -

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - There are some differences, I must say.

Mr WINTER - Standing Order 2, Speaker.

The SPEAKER - Thank you. I call the Premier to the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Stop scaring people. This is not an issue to be scared of.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - This is about getting our own team.

Dr Woodruff - Stop being dishonest.

Mr Bayley - You are telling them to engage in the process, then you are trying to bypass the process.

The SPEAKER - The Leader of the Greens has some latitude as the leader; the Deputy Leader has none - but both of it has wound up.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It is a building on a wasteland with sewage works next to it. I mean, seriously, it is a huge opportunity for Tasmania.

Mr Bayley - You had plans for housing. You had a truth and reconciliation park.

The SPEAKER - The Deputy Leader of the Greens is warned.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Why would I not be looking at all options around this project? The option that I am pursuing vigorously is the Project of State Significance option. That is the option that I am pursuing. I am also canvassing other options, which is why we have sought advice. You know?

Dr Woodruff - Right.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Yes, right.

The SPEAKER - No conversations across the Chamber. The Premier will address his answer through the Chair.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It is not Armageddon. Parliament will have their say on this. Honestly.

Mr Bayley - With or without a process?

The SPEAKER - Before hearing the supplementary question, the Deputy Leader of the Greens is warned again, Mr Bayley.

Supplementary Question

The SPEAKER - Is that a supplementary question from you, Dr Woodruff? I will hear it.

Dr WOODRUFF - There is a supplementary question. The Premier has confirmed that he has asked for advice. He talked about this process. The POSS process that we are in requires the next step to be public submissions followed by public hearings followed by a decision from the Tasmanian Planning Commission: their recommendation to parliament. Premier, when did you seek advice? When did you expect an answer? Will you tell us whether you are going to bring in a -

The SPEAKER - The time for asking the question has expired.
Dr Woodruff - special permit rubber stamp approval?

The SPEAKER - The supplementary question is allowed because the Premier did refer to having sought advice in his original answer. I will draw you to the timing of that.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Minister Ellis can stop being so helpful. He gets a warning for his continued helpfulness today. There is going to be no one in this Chamber by the end of Question Time. Not even you, Mr O'Byrne. I heard you interjecting before. The Premier will address the supplementary question, which was when he sought advice, which arises from the answer that he gave.

Mr ROCKLIFF - All right. Submissions close on 8 May for the TPC. Was that a question asked?

The SPEAKER - No. That was the preamble. I will draw you to the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - That was the preamble. Sorry.

Dr Woodruff - No, to be fair, it was about confirming -

The SPEAKER – Sorry. No. If you wish to speak then you can seek the call. Your preamble dealt with the process. Your actual question was when the Premier sought advice. I wrote it down. I have given my ruling. The Premier has 30 seconds to address that now.

Mr ROCKLIFF - All right, okay. Public submissions close on 8 May. I had a verbal conversation with my department yesterday to seek advice. Thank you.


Roadwork - Penalties for Failing to Meet Deadlines

Mrs BESWICK question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE, Mr VINCENT

[10.44 a.m.]
The condition of Tasmania's roads continues to create serious safety concerns and delays for motorists. Despite the government's promise of a blitz, and the Premier filling one in, potholes still pose a risk to drivers and their vehicles. My constituents are frustrated over how long it takes repair work to be completed. The stretch of road past the Anvers Chocolate Factory is a prime example, with the sealing work taking around two years to complete. Minister, you promised to scrutinise the contracts in place and how they can be improved. When was the last time a contractor received a penalty for failing to meet a deadline?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, we have done a lot of work on this. As you can imagine, roads are not something that you can change across the whole state. I have been meeting with a lot of the contractors. We have sorted out some issues with the maintenance contracts to do with potholes. We have also sorted out quite a bit of information regarding the major patching on some of the roads. There is some dispute over some of the areas where the roads have not met standards. The department is working through those on a contractual basis. We are also very close to finalising the budget for next year for major re-sheeting of roads, which is the other big maintenance thing we can accelerate over the next couple of years to prevent some of these issues occurring.

We are also working with what sections of the highway - and there are a couple around Sassafras -  I think Ashgrove is talked about a fair bit and a bit around Anvers where we have to consider our contracts with what we have coming up with the 80:20 split with federal road repairs in some areas. We are finalising those within the Infrastructure budget which we are working through right now. A lot of those things have been fixed. You will see just on the northern side of Campbell Town where we have experimented through our contractors for road maintenance, a different method for doing major patching on our highways, which will stand up a lot more before we have to do a reseal program. I am happy to get a little bit more information and detail for you, but over the next few months, as the budgets are approved, a lot of those things will be worked through in the next 12 months. 

The SPEAKER - Can I confirm, minister, were you taking something on notice then? 

Mr VINCENT - Sorry?

The SPEAKER - You said that you would get more information. Is that related to the question?

Mr VINCENT - Yes, it is. On the actual area around Anvers.

The SPEAKER - Are you comfortable with that, member?

Mrs BESWICK - Yes.


Integrity Commission - Cox Review Recommendations

Mr JENNER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.47 a.m.]
It has been nearly 10 years now since the Cox review into the Integrity Commission was released. Can I ask how many of the 55 recommendations has your government implemented within that time? Will you also commit to setting a timeframe to implement the rest of the recommendations?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question and interest in this matter. I am sure the Attorney-General can provide a fulsome answer to this. The Cox review made 55 recommendations and the government has accepted the majority of those recommendations in full or in principle. Six of these recommendations are now complete, addressing technical and other relatively straightforward matters. 

There has already been a significant amount of work undertaken in considering Cox review recommendations and other suggested reforms, including consultation through the release of a discussion paper in 2022. It is a complex area with many additional issues and proposals arising out of the later reviews and consultation, with one of the recommendations proposing 45 technical amendments to the act.

I am advised that the Department of Justice is now drafting a plan for staged implementation of recommendations, with an aim to bring additional legislation to the parliament as soon as possible to allow time for drafting and efficient stakeholder consultation. 

I have answered the question directly in terms of how many. I will also say we strongly support the values in the work of the Integrity Commission, we respect the independent nature of the commission to do its work and have every confidence in its ability to undertake its duties.

The review of the Integrity Commission under the confidence and stability agreement with myself and the parliamentary members of the Jacqui Lambie Network did not progress. This is because, in developing the terms of reference and exploring options to appoint a reviewer, the government sought and has received legal advice. However, we are working through those recommendations. We will also be implementing the recommendations of the Weiss review and the continuing work of the recommendations of the commission of inquiry.

In April this year, the government will bring the Justice Legislation Amendment, (Evidence and Integrity Commission Reforms) Bill to parliament, which introduces mandatory public authority notification of serious misconduct and misconduct by designated public officers to the Integrity Commission. These reforms were endorsed by the Cox review and the commission of inquiry through recommendations 18.11.

Supplementary Question

Mr JENNER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

Mr JENNER - As I said, it has been 10 years now. Will you commit to setting a timeframe for the implementation of the rest of the recommendations? That was the end of the question.

The SPEAKER - I will call the Premier to the question about the timeframe, which was the original question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the member for the question. We will be progressing as soon as practically possible.


Energy Assets - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.51 a.m.]
Public ownership of energy assets has underpinned this industry in this state for 100 years. Right now, it is clear that major industrial customers like Liberty Bell Bay and Nyrstar are under extraordinary stress. Hundreds of workers are facing an uncertain future and need to be assured your government will use every power available to protect their jobs. For 100 years, these assets have been used strategically by governments to underpin our economy. How will you guarantee the future of these businesses and the jobs of those workers if you sell off TasNetworks and parts of Hydro?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my right, the Premier does not need your help as he comes to the lectern for the answer. Thank you, Premier. You have the call.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. I have just outlined in a previous answer to your question that Hydro has signed a 10-year deal with Liberty and that provides that security. I am surprised that I have not heard much from the member on asset sales recently. I do not know why that is. It might be because the member is on record as supporting privatisation in the past. I think that is the reason why the member has been very quiet around the point.

Ms Dow - What about these Tasmanian jobs, Premier?

The SPEAKER - The deputy leader can take the point of order if she wishes. Premier.

Ms Haddad - Seven questions in Question Time, so quiet.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I missed that one, Ms Haddad.

The SPEAKER - So did I, Ms Haddad, but I will be watching.

Ms Haddad - I said we have asked seven questions in Question Time. It is not very quiet. Thanks Hansard.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I am sure it was captured on Hansard. I am sure I will find it at some point in time and chuckle away.

I have a number of quotes here from the member about privatisation and asset sales, which I will not venture into right now, but the member is all over the place on this, just as the policy was all over the place in the election.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF – They had our energy policy which completely gutted Hydro. I believe there was a company going to be set up called 'Tas Power Co', or something; I am not sure. I only had 48 hours to read it. I was busy during the campaign, as you would appreciate. It was there and then it was gone.

Ms DOW - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The Premier has gone nowhere near the question that the Leader of the Opposition asked, and that was directly about the impact of his privatisation plans on those 300 workers.

The SPEAKER - I will call the Premier to the question. Thank you, Premier; you have 48 seconds.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, honourable Speaker, for the opportunity. We made it very clear when we announced in the state of the state address that Hydro will remain in public hands. We made that very clear, unlike your 48-hour policy when you were going to gut Hydro altogether. That was your policy. You were out there very proud of it until we had some concerns from the unions and it was withdrawn. I would have loved to be a fly on the wall during those few days -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary from the Leader of the Opposition.

Mr WINTER - It is to ask the same question again and again. Perhaps, the Premier could show some respect to those workers and answer a question about their futures. For 100 years, publicly owned energy assets have been used strategically by governments to underpin our economy. How will you guarantee the future of those businesses and the jobs of those workers if you sell off and privatise TasNetworks and parts of Hydro?

The SPEAKER - I will call the Premier to the original question for the supplementary. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - First, Hydro will remain in government hands. We have made that very clear. Second, transmission is regulated and the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) determines acceptable transmission costs? Third, when you lot were in government, you tried to sell Aurora -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left. Supplementary questions only have a short answer period. Do not waste it.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Fourth, we will always respect every single employee in this state and will fight for their jobs. You could show some respect to the Tasmanian people by making your position clear on matters, because you were a great advocate for privatisation less than a decade ago and now you have flip-flopped again because it suits you.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Premier. I gave some latitude to the interjections then, but please do not incite them in the future. I will take the Leader of the Opposition.


Energy Assets - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

Liberty Bell Bay is not the only major industrial facing significant challenges. Last week, it was reported that the CEO of Trafigura, the parent company of Nyrstar in Hobart, described the smelter as an uncompetitive asset. He warned that government assistance and even potentially part ownership would be needed to ensure its ongoing future and the jobs of 500 workers there.

The business has been a central part of Tasmania's economy for over 100 years and exists because of Tasmania's century-long commitment to using public ownership of assets to support Tasmanian industry. If you privatise Tasmania's energy assets, you will be privatising control of Tasmania's energy future. Why should skilled workers in Tasmania's biggest manufacturing businesses pay the price for your budget crisis?

Ms Butler - Watch him not answer it.

Mr Winter - Another history lesson.

Ms Butler - Ten years ago - come on.

The SPEAKER - Member for Lyons, you are warned - first of all for the interjection, and then the behaviour afterwards. I call the Premier.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, the member did not listen to my answer to the last question. You clearly do not understand energy. You do not understand that the AER determines acceptable transmission cost and transmission is regulated.

You mentioned Nyrstar. I am concerned, clearly. I wrote to the Prime Minister, and with the environment we are in now with the federal election coming up, I have written to the Leader of the Opposition, Peter Dutton, as well, advocating first and foremost on behalf of Nyrstar and their employees, given the significance of not only the employees directly associated in Southern Tasmania, but all the supply chains leading into that no doubt.

Of course I am concerned, and that is why I have sought federal support and a good conversation about this. This is a national issue in many respects when it comes to smelters across the nation, so what that needs is a good strategic approach to this nationally given its significance in other parts of the country. The significance of Nyrstar is huge for Tasmania more broadly, and so we will always play a very key role in a strong role of advocacy when it comes to supporting the sustainability of businesses such as Nyrstar, and where that requires federal intervention, we will call for that.

Supplementary Question

The SPEAKER - Am I hearing a supplementary?

Mr WINTER - Yes. Coming from the answer from the Premier, he talks about the level of support required by governments. Does the Premier accept that his government's decision to increase transmission prices for our major industrials by almost 20 per cent this year is hurting their viability going forward?

The SPEAKER - I will allow the supplementary. It goes a little close to a new question, but I think it is within the realms of that first question and the answer the Premier gave.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I do not accept the premise of the member's supplementary question at all. The global environment we are working in is very challenging in the national environment. What I am proud of is a state government sensibly sitting down with major industrials securing 10-year agreements such as Hydro and Liberty. I am proud of the fact that, among the states, we have the lowest regulated energy prices in the nation. I am proud of the fact that through the energy crisis globally, nationally and impacting at a state level, we have reached in and supported everyday mums and dads, Tasmanians and households, when it comes to a partnership with the federal government, when it comes to our direct power bill support, as well through the renewable energy dividend and a policy announced in August 2023.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=26.9_D=2.0_C=0.57] The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Cost

Mr BAYLEY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.01 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=31.6_D=24.0_C=0.78] During the election, you promised the Tasmanian people that the state government spend for the Macquarie Point Stadium would be capped at $375 million and 'not one red cent more.' Your opposition partner, Mr Winter, has now backed you in on the Macquarie Point Stadium but has also claimed Labor's support would be conditional on this promise being maintained.

Mr Bayley - Why do you not just say you are against the teams?

The SPEAKER - The shadow treasurer has already been warned. 

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=56.1_D=4.4_C=0.86] Mr BAYLEY - The Tasmanian Planning Commission has now estimated the price tag at $1.2 billion, a [Bookmark: Phr6_O=60.8_D=20.0_C=0.73]  $450,000 cost blowout for Tasmanians. On top of this, there would be at least $1.86 billion of debt the stadium would create over the next decade, risking a credit rating downgrade for Tasmania. Premier, is there any price that is too high for you to lump onto Tasmanians to get up a Rockliff-Winter stadium unity ticket?

Members interjecting.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=83.4_D=5.5_C=0.63] The SPEAKER - Would you like to hear the last part of that question again, Premier, or are you comfortable to answer it?

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=90.8_D=0.5_C=0.39] Mr ROCKLIFF - I thought it was a question for Mr Winter, not for me. 

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=95.0_D=18.8_C=0.66] The SPEAKER - Whilst bizarrely there are options for other questions, Premier, the question was directed by the Deputy Leader of the Greens to you.
Mr ROCKLIFF - Easy mistake to make, to think that was a question for Mr Winter. We are committed to the $375 million capital put into this project and we are committed to seeing the project to fruition. We are also  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=114.4_D=29.6_C=0.73] committed to the associated infrastructure in and around the project such as the northern corridor.

Dr Woodruff - On top of the $375 million.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Let us have a sensible conversation, please. 

The SPEAKER - Actually, let us not have a conversation. Let us have questions and answer time. The question has been asked and the Premier will address that through the Chair. as tempting as it might be to respond to Dr Woodruff.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Whatever you build at Macquarie Point, as attracted as you are to the wasteland and the sewage works; whatever you build on Macquarie Point, be that a library or baths or something -

Mr Bayley - A truth and reconciliation park, like last time.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=144.3_D=8.4_C=0.46] Mr ROCKLIFF - The Eden Project, higher than the stadium.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader, you have already been warned. 

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=154.5_D=6.0_C=0.57] Mr ROCKLIFF - You know that one. Remember that? Remember those domes, those big ones? No, you do not remember that. Alright.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=163.7_D=6.5_C=0.54] Dr Woodruff - There is one big fat dome that is going to be there.

The SPEAKER - First of all, Premier, stop it. Second of all, Leader of the Greens, you are warned. The Premier has the call.

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=176.6_D=16.1_C=0.64] Sorry, I missed the last part of your question.

Mr Bayley - Would you like me to repeat it?

The SPEAKER - No, I will decide on that. The Premier will answer the question as he knows; you will be entitled to a supplementary.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We said we would put $375 million capital into this and that is what we will put in. Plus there is $240 million from the federal government. There will be private investors as well.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - Honourable Speaker, a supplementary?

The SPEAKER - Potentially.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=194.2_D=16.8_C=0.69] Mr BAYLEY - I think I heard the Premier say they have put $375 million into the stadium, but are you still saying you are going to cap it at that? You have previously said not one red cent more. We have not heard you repeat that this week.  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=211.3_D=4.6_C=0.61] Are you capping it at $375 million? 

The SPEAKER - That was the original question, Premier. Actually, the original question was is there any price too high, but I will take it.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=219.6_D=29.5_C=0.63] Mr ROCKLIFF - That is right - $375 million is a cap, is it not? 

Mr Bayley - Yes. It is just a start. 

Mr ROCKLIFF – However, there will be other investments of associated infrastructure, of course, which we need outside the direct stadium infrastructure, as you would appreciate, such as the road network and all that associated infrastructure that would need to be there when it comes to  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=249.9_D=19.5_C=0.61] anything you build on the Macquarie Point. I mean, that is the sensible thing.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I am sure the members on my left having a conversation are not interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - That is sensible. It is all Armageddon with you lot. Every single thing is the biggest disaster in the world. 

Ms Burnet - It is taxpayer's money.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Ms Burnet, member for Clark is now warned. She has been interjecting quite a bit today, as has Dr Broad who just got himself a warning as well. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=269.4_D=3.4_C=0.87] 

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=273.4_D=2.8_C=0.74] Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, Dr Broad.  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=277.9_D=26.6_C=0.67] Will you be sensible about it all? It is a significant project which has its challenges. 

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Recognition of Visitors

The SPEAKER - We are going to be very sensible about it and welcome what might be the final group of The Friends' School students who are joining us in the gallery for this week. Thank you all very much. You are having a lot more fun than me right now, so if any of you want to sub in this chair that is fine. If you could get Eloise for me, that would be great. She was training to be Speaker very well last week, so thank you.

Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation - Opposition

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.06 a.m.]
You announced that, because you had broken the budget, you would seek to sell assets that have been helping to pay to keep power prices lower for Tasmanians and help pay for our schools and hospitals. The Legislative Council has expressed its overwhelming position in relation to your fire sale plan and Tasmanians know that privatisation means higher prices in a cost-of-living crisis and less money for schools and hospitals. If, after today, there is no pathway to achieve your plan to sell Tasmanian assets, will you admit it is dead and drop it?

The SPEAKER - I will call the Premier but remind members that we are not in a position, as tempting as it is, to reflect on matters that take place in the other place.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. The answer is no, because why would there not be sensible members of parliament across the Chamber listening to the arguments presented before they make a decision on certain matters around privatisation that needs to come to the parliament? I simply ask the parliament, in response to your wedge motion and the politics - our challenges are bigger than your politics, Dean. 

Members interjecting.  

Mr ROCKLIFF - We have big global issues we are confronted with -

The SPEAKER - The Premier will address the Leader of the Opposition by his title or seat -

Mr Winter - These are not global issues. These are your issues.

The SPEAKER - The Leader of the Opposition will not interject.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It just shows you how insular you are in your thinking because we have global issues at the moment, including tariffs, for example, which can impact on the state of Tasmania -

Mr Winter - Sorry, are you blaming global issues for your budget?

Mr ROCKLIFF - and it comes through the decisions of the United States.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition, you are warned already.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We are not immune to those global decisions and implications of significant decisions such as that. We are not immune to the effects of - 

Members interjecting.

Member Suspended

Member for Franklin - Ms Brown

The SPEAKER - Premier, can I ask you to stop for just a moment? The member for Lyons, you are warned. No, you are warned. You can call a point of order or something else in a moment. Member for Franklin, you will excuse yourself from the Chamber for constant interjections. I will allow you to return at the end of the MPI. We will wait till Ms Brown has vacated the room.

Ms Brown withdrew.
———————————————————
The SPEAKER - The call is with the Premier. Do you have a point of order?

Ms BUTLER - Honourable Speaker, my point of order is in relation to unparliamentary behaviour. The Premier referred to our leader as 'Dean' instead of Leader of the Opposition.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, member, I did call the Premier and remind him to refer to members by their proper titles. That will apply to both sides of this Chamber. Thank you, Premier, you have the call on the original question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We are not immune to the global environment. We are not immune to conflicts across the globe because they impact on food and fuel prices for this nation, for example. We have to be agile and flexible when it comes to policy in Tasmania.

I reject the premise of your question about budget. This is simply an exercise in ensuring that the businesses that are valuable in public hands remain in public hands, and how can we deliver better services to Tasmanians? Should we support the sale of some of those assets? There might only be two or three at the end of the day, but why would you not do the work, as we have commissioned Mr Eslake to do, to present to the Tasmanian people the benefits or otherwise of privatisation? I implore the parliament to wait for that advice. If, at the end of the day -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. 

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear a supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - Stemming from the Premier's answer, early in his answer he outlined that it was a global problem that his budget seemed to be broken. Can he explain what elements of the global economy forced his government to run three consecutive billion-dollar deficits? 

Advisers interjecting - Global inflation. Global pandemic.

The SPEAKER - The interjections from the advisers' box are loud enough to be heard on Hansard. That will cease.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I can think of one, and that is the pandemic. 

Mr Winter - The last three budgets?

Mr ROCKLIFF - That might have escaped you.

Mr Winter - The last three budgets?

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition, if you are warned again, you will be leaving the Chamber. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - The pandemic might have escaped you, Mr Winter. It certainly did not escape members of the government when we were investing in our health services, in businesses and community services to keep people in work and well in this state - an up to two-billion-dollar investment. There is one example for you and I am sure I can find many others. The Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry -

Dr Broad - We cannot trust you.

The SPEAKER - Dr Broad, you are warned again as well. These warnings are in place all day, and it is private members' time so I am sure members wish to be here. The Premier's time for answering the supplementary has expired. Interjections do actually take up the time of the answers. 


Children and Youth Services - Investment 

Ms ROSOL question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.11 a.m.]
You justify your fixation on progressing the stadium at any cost by insisting the stadium will benefit the future of Tasmanians and yet right now, children's futures are being jeopardised by a lack of funding for services they desperately need to keep them safe and put them on a positive pathway. Child Safety Services is underfunded. Youth Justice is underfunded. Children and young people are missing out on vital support that would be transformative for their futures. When will you prioritise the needs of children and invest in Children and Youth services in ways that will truly benefit their futures?

Mr Jaensch - An additional $30 million in the budget, $30 million year on year, additional funding in the budget.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Mr Jaensch, I have no tolerance today. You are formally warned. We have two more questions to go. Let us get through it.



ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank Ms Rosol for the question. I agree with her sentiment around supporting those essential services, particularly supporting children and young people, and for very good reason. We have had a considerable amount of work with the commission of inquiry, which we are committed to, the recommendations and significant investment. I would argue against the premise of your question. We are investing more than ever before when it comes to our children and young people, more than ever before on schools, both infrastructure and resources in schools, and in child protection because it is much needed. I concur. Some of those investments include supporting our children with our lunch program in schools, extending that to another 15 schools, to ensure that our young people are in a learning environment where they feel safe and included. When they feel safe and included at school, they learn. When they do not feel safe and included, that is a barrier to learning.

More than ever before, we have invested in supporting our students with disability. We have nation-leading supports for our students with disability where the need goes directly to the student. We previously had that rather crude approach to the IQ of 50 to 70 for our students and the funding just went straight to that area. Now, it is whatever the student needs to learn. Whatever the barrier is, we will support the reduction of that barrier to learning. 

No doubt we have more work to do there. We also need to continue to grow our economy, which is why I am so supportive of key infrastructure development in Tasmania; enabling infrastructure. I see the stadia infrastructure as enabling infrastructure to grow our economy. I thought the Tasmanian Planning Commission issues paper was deficient in terms of extolling the true benefits of the economy, because when you have a growing economy and you support Tasmanians in work, you get to fund the essential services.

It reminds me of some information I saw this morning released by Mr Ferguson about the impact of the Greens policies federally. If we do not have a mining industry or a forest industry -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. I am not seeing a seeking of a supplementary. Therefore, Mr Garland, with the final question of today, if it gets answered straight away.


Encrypted Messaging Services - Retention of Messages

Mr GARLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.15 a.m.]
Last month, the Australian Information Commissioner released a report which showed the practice of government members and advisers using encrypted messaging services is widespread in the Commonwealth parliament. We know the American government is using it - or misusing it. Premier, I can attest that your ministers' advisers prefer communicating via these encrypted apps as well. This practice has the potential to restrict the public's right to information about government decisions and reasons, for all the reasons raised by the Information Commissioner.

What policies or guidelines does your government have in place to ensure that records of communication sent by ministers and their staff using encrypted messaging apps about government business are being retained and made available for disclosure or archiving? Will you table those policies, guidelines or procedures in this House?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, yes, we communicate by text, WhatsApp, and Signal as well. It is a good way of communicating. I am not sure where the question is leading, but as I see it there is certainly nothing untoward about communicating between members of parliament. The most effective method of doing that, the easiest method usually, is WhatsApp, from my understanding. I am not massive on all this stuff.

I will seek some clarification from you about exactly what you required in terms of the information that you seek around policies and procedures. Really, the communication that we make across this Chamber is one that is efficient and one that I would hope to lead to better outcomes for the Tasmanian people. I will seek some further advice for you and get back to you.

Supplementary Question

Mr GARLAND - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr GARLAND - Will you table those policies, guidelines and procedures in the House, once you have them?

The SPEAKER - The Premier has advised he has taken that question on notice. I am not sure that he can add more until he gets the additional information, but if the -

Mr O'Byrne - Just do not add a journo to the chat group.

The SPEAKER - Are we just going to have a chat, then? That would be great. Thank you, Mr O'Byrne. With that - is everybody paying attention? - Mr O'Byrne, you are warned.

A member - Kick him out.

The SPEAKER - It is what the people want, Dave.

Time expired.


STATEMENTS BY SPEAKER

Microphone Etiquette

The SPEAKER - Before we move into Constituency Questions, there have been some challenges for Hansard today because you are all really annoying - no. If you are speaking from your chair for your supplementary question, I do need you to use your microphone. If you are standing for supplementary questions, some of them have been a bit inaudible, which makes the Hansard a little bit challenging. During your supplementary question, either speak into your microphone or feel free to come forward and use the lecterns that get picked up a little easier than that.


Member Warnings

The warnings that are in place are in place all day. The warnings, therefore, so that nobody gets themselves in trouble: Ms Finlay, you are on two; Mr Willie, one; Ms Dow, one; Ms Brown has been removed from the Parliament until the end of the MPI, but her warnings are in place when she returns; Mr Bayley, one; minister Ellis, one; Ms Butler, one; Drs Woodruff and Broad, one each; Mr Winter, the Leader of the Opposition, two; minister Jaensch, one; and Mr O'Byrne, one.

With that, these apply all day. It is private members' day, which gets a bit fiery, so let us just focus and make sure that we all get through the House without anyone else leaving.


CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Small Businesses - Effect of Beer Tax

Ms FINLAY question to MINISTER for the ENVIRONMENT, Ms OGILVIE

[11.20 a.m.]
A constituent of mine runs a drink manufacturing business and is very concerned about the impact of the Premier's beer tax. He says major customers like the Endeavour Group and airports refuse price increases from small businesses like his. He also says he has years of labels on stock, and the new red tape around labelling will cost him tens of thousands of dollars - way more than what is on offer from the grant scheme. Do you accept the policy will result in lower profit margins and out-of-pocket costs for businesses like his?


North East Wind Project - Consultation

Mrs PENTLAND question to MINISTER for HOUSING, PLANNING, and CONSUMER AFFAIRS, Mr ELLIS

A constituent of Tomahawk in my electorate of Bass is concerned about the lack of consultation regarding the proposed locations for the North East Wind Project by ACEN. He is worried about the impact of Tomahawk surroundings with 19 turbine towers, each 270 metres high, potentially surrounding the town just three kilometres away. He is also concerned about the long-term health and wellbeing effects on the community during and after construction.

While the project has been declared a major project and will undergo an impact assessment by AEC later this year, my constituent is concerned about the lack of consultation with both the public and the Tomahawk Protection Society and wants to know whether the minister is willing to meet with them to ensure their voices and concerns are heard.
Emissions Reduction Targets and Timelines

Ms BADGER question to MINISTER for the ENVIRONMENT, Ms OGILVIE

On behalf of my constituent Peter from Dodges Ferry, who asks: the objectives of the Climate Change Act include setting a target for greenhouse gas emission reduction. While your government has aimed for net zero, you have no actual plan to cut emissions. You are using our state's renewable energy generation and unlogged forests to offset continuing emissions. This is not the real climate action that Tasmanians have consistently demanded or that you have previously promised. This is greenwashing. 

Can you detail your actual targets and timeline for emissions reduction and across which sectors these will take place, or instead of real climate action, are you just committed to climate denial through delays?


Southern Tasmania - High School Sports

Mr BEHRAKIS question to MINISTER for SPORT and EVENTS, Mr DUIGAN

We know how important sport and active recreation is for our young people, not only for physical wellbeing but also for mental health and community connection. How is the government supporting high school students, particularly in Southern Tasmania, with school sport opportunities?


Ambulance - Taking Deceased Patients to Mortuaries

Mr JENNER question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

A few weeks ago I called into your office and spoke to your colleague regarding an incident in Richmond. It appears that if an ambulance is called in an emergency and the patient dies in the presence of the paramedics, the paramedics cannot take the person to the mortuary. On this occasion the dead man was left there on the nature strip for over four hours before the mortuary van arrived.

This is a totally unacceptable situation and I see no reason why the ambulance cannot take a dead person to hospital. After all, if he had died in the ambulance, it would have been a different matter. I hope you have been able to take this matter up with the Health minister.


Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Regulations 2019 -Proposal for Repeal

Ms HADDAD question to ATTORNEY-GENERAL, Mr BARNETT

It is on behalf of my constituent, Scott, who contacted me on behalf of transgender and gender diverse Tasmanians. Earlier this year, Women Speak Tasmania posted on their Facebook page that representatives from their organisation met with the Attorney-General, Guy Barnett, about Tasmania's Birth, Deaths and Marriages Registration Regulations 2019. The post read, and I quote:

The meeting was very productive and Mr Barnett expressed considerable interest in the impressive body of evidence put forward and committed to looking further into the issues raised. 

The law reform in 2019 has been overwhelmingly positive and has done no harm to anybody outside the transgender and gender diverse community. Will the Attorney-General rule out repealing those 2019 reforms and give Tasmanians a clear commitment that they will not be at risk under his leadership of that portfolio?


UTAS Stadium Development

Mr FAIRS question to MINISTER for SPORT and EVENTS, Mr DUIGAN

I understand that the transformation of the University of Tasmania's UTAS Stadium has taken some steps forward in recent weeks. There is obviously a lot of excitement about the project. However, some locals in my electorate have asked me what exactly is being delivered as part of the project. We know enhancements will elevate UTAS Stadium into a world-class destination for sports and entertainment, benefiting fans, athletes and the entire Launceston community. Minister, can you outline exactly what the project aspects of the development are?


Tasmanian Health Service - Workplace Abuse Report Reprisal

Mr GARLAND question to ATTORNEY-GENERAL, Mr BARNETT

If a staff member in the Tasmanian Health Service reported workplace abuse, misconduct or malpractice, would they be protected from reprisal under the Public Interest Disclosures Act 2002? If not, why not?

MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Tourism, Trade and Major Investment

[11.28 a.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House take note of the following matter: tourism, trade and major investment

I rise this morning to present a matter of public importance - a matter that has been discussed quite broadly in the Chamber this morning and has been the focus of engagement with the Premier. The title of the matter of public importance this morning is around tourism; it is around trade and major investment. These are in fact the three portfolio areas of the Premier yet, despite this being a matter of significance for the state and across each of the portfolio areas that the Premier is responsible for, he no longer feels that it is reasonable or necessary to be in the Chamber this morning. The circumstances of the major industrials in Tasmania have been highlighted this morning and our concerns and the concerns of Tasmanians about the security and the confidence of our major industrials in Tasmania at the moment and the challenges that they face.

As a former opposition spokesperson for small business, it is often said that small business is the backbone of the economy. Well, if small business is the backbone of the economy - which I absolutely agree with - there is no doubt that our major industrials in Tasmania are the foundation. There is a significant reliance on the constants and the strength of our major industrials in Tasmania not only to deliver the foundation for the Tasmanian economy but also to provide the security of the electricity network in Tasmania. When you have the lever that this government can apply to support our major industrials in Tasmania being power prices, then we would expect, in the community expects and those workers and all of the businesses that support those major industrials expect, that the government will do whatever is possible to ensure that that lever, that they can control, that they offer in the best interests and provide support for in the best interests of our major industrials.

We have seen through international, national and local news over recent days and weeks the concerns around Liberty and the concerns about Nyrstar. We know that just this morning it has been disclosed that the energy minister himself, who has Liberty in his electorate, cannot actually state the last time that he met with them. When you have a significant employer in your area, not only of your portfolio responsibility but in your electorate and you are not in constant contact and you are not meeting with them, that is another demonstration that we have already been able to paint a picture of, of a minister not only out of his depth but out of contact and out of care for those people who need to rely on him.

Over recent weeks and recent months we have seen the energy minister, the Premier and this government let down Tasmanians in terms of undermining the certainty and the confidence around what Tasmanians need in terms of power to power the future for Tasmania. We have seen back-pedaling and then mess correction from the minister and Premier about commitments in Tasmania for power prices. The minister himself this morning actually interjected and said that power prices were not a concern for the major industrials. That was not the thing that was concerning them at the moment. When you have increases confirmed this morning by the minister of around 20 per cent in the financial year and likely to be more than 10 per cent in the future year for transmission costs, that is a concern for the major industrials in Tasmania. It is one of their major cost centres in their business and it is something that absolutely causes them concern when not engaged with and supported in positive ways - and then you have other areas at risk, other major investment, other major projects at risk because of the lack of capacity and delivery from this government around our major renewable projects.

Just this morning people talked about and the minister was on his feet saying 'you know, we absolutely back-in and we know that Tasmania needs new generation.' Well, if only this government could deliver new generation in Tasmania. The minister, trying to play politics in the last week, undermined the certainty of North West Transmission, undermined the certainty of Marinus, in terms of what is needed to secure not actual, potential, investment in Tasmania, in terms of $25 billion. I was caused to clarify the way that I refer to this potential investment in Tasmania by minister Ellis' interjection last week. It is massively frustrated and likely to leave Tasmania: $25 billion of investment in renewables in Tasmania, because this government cannot get out of the way and support investors to come into Tasmania.

If we cannot increase the generation, we cannot attract the new loads in Tasmania. If we cannot ensure that this government understands the critical material impact of excessive increases in power prices for our major industrials, then Tasmania is going to continue to be challenged by and continue to be undermined by the lack of capacity of this government. There is no doubt that a matter of public importance in this place that should have the attention of the Premier is major investment and major projects in Tasmania and this government is letting them down.

[11.34 a.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Deputy Premier) - Honourable Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to the important topics of tourism, trade and major investment. What we are on about as a government is growing our economy. As the Premier said this morning, backing business, backing industry, creating more jobs - more than 45,000 since we have been elected.

We have turned the economy around since Labor and the Greens were in office and they have talked much today about electricity prices and the energy sector. When they were in government it was a 65 per cent increase for all Tasmanians - residential Tasmanians, small businesses. They copped it in the neck. We were in recession. Ten thousand jobs were lost. The productive industries were brought to their knees, particularly forestry. We have turned it around. We now have a vision to grow the economy. We have now hit more than $40 billion in terms of our growth state product. That is the highest it has ever been.

Mr Willie - Underpinned by debt-funded public spending.

The SPEAKER - Mr Willie, do you wish to make a contribution to the debate? Thank you.

Mr BARNETT - I am glad Mr Willie's acknowledged the record economic growth in this state at more than $40 billion. It has never been that high and, of course, we have record low unemployment and a strong economy, and the strongest wages growth in the country. The record retail trade figures came out yesterday. I noted that again publicly, and that is actually 61 per cent higher than when we first came to government in 2014. It is a very significant increase that is just not acknowledged by those on the other side. Exports were a massive $4.64 billion in the 2024 calendar year, 68 per cent higher than the 12 months to March 2014 - again, a huge increase. 

The Premier and I have mentioned many times that our business confidence is number one in Australia. Why is it that state Labor are so relentlessly negative, talking Tasmania down? It does not do them any good and it does not do Tasmanian business any good.

The Tasmanian Chamber of Industry and Commerce (TCCI) has already acknowledged the Premier's state of the state address as being one of the most ambitious in decades, and they are very pleased with our efforts to cut red tape and make it easier for business to operate. There are more than 40,000 small businesses in Tasmania and we are backing them in. We are cutting red tape and streamlining processes, making it easier for business to get on with their business and getting government out of the way. 

I have been there, done that. I have been in business. I ran and managed and operated my own business for 13 years prior to entering the Senate. I won the Tasmanian government and Telstra Small Business Award in 2000 for businesses up to the size of 20 people. I was very pleased and proud. I know how hard small businesses do it, putting their neck on the line, and that is where we are backing them in.

We are backing in big business as well: the major industrials. The Premier made it clear and the Minister for Energy and Renewables made it clear. We backed them in and thank them for their leadership. The energy agreement with Hydro has been signed in recent months - it was announced publicly; it is on the public record. The Premier acted very quickly to write to the Prime Minister with respect to Nyrstar. We are backing them in.

We are backing in infrastructure and of course the $30-billion infrastructure pipeline for Tasmania. That does not just happen. It has increased and increased on increase under our government. We have spent $6 billion since 2014; then in last year's budget, we had more than $5 billion for infrastructure. That is for road, rail, port, health infrastructure, upgrading our hospitals throughout the state, health infrastructure, schools - new schools. We are backing it in. We are making a difference.

Business community is backing it in saying they are more confident than any other jurisdiction in Australia. Tasmania is open for business. We are making a difference and we know there is a very big road ahead. We have a long-term plan, where of course the opposition have no plan, no alternative budget and no alternative costed policies.

[11.39 a.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to give my contribution on this matter of public importance: tourism, trade and major investment. I am going to stick to my portfolio areas, which are around the economy, finance and major investment. I cannot do anything but focus on the Macquarie Point Stadium effectively as a case study about how not to do major investment, because it is a slow motion train wreck that is happening. 

The Planning Commission's interim report tells us everything we need to know about this stadium. This stadium does not have a social licence in the first place. We have the majority of Tasmanians opposing it; we have the majority in the south opposing it and we have an even greater majority in the north opposing it. This is an issue from a financial perspective, from a location perspective and from an implication perspective, and all that sheets home to proper planning and how you do this kind of investment.

The Planning Commission has been really clear in its interim draft report. It tells us that the stadium is going to cost far more than the government is willing to admit, and is certainly going to cost us more than the government claims it is going to cap and that the Labor Party has set as a precondition in relation to its support for the stadium.

The Tasmanian Planning Commission tells us that the Tasmanian government is going to need to borrow, or otherwise finance, $992 million on this. Over 10 years it will increase our debt by $1.86 billion. That will cost us an extra $76 million every year to service, and the cost benefits just do not stack up. The costs exceed the benefits by $669 million at present value. That $1.86 billion debt will then add to Tasmania's already ballooning debt burden, which poses a genuine risk to the downgrading of our credit rating.

The finances are really clear, and when it comes to major infrastructure investment, economist Saul Eslake is abundantly clear on this: set yourself an infrastructure budget that is what can be afforded and managed within the constraints of the budget, and then prioritise your projects underneath that. Do not just pick your projects and commit to them willy-nilly, irrespective of the costs.

When it comes to the AFL stadium at Macquarie Point, it is on the record. It is there in black and white that Tasmanians are on the hook for every single dollar of the cost blowouts that are inevitable with this project.

When it comes to major investment in infrastructure, planning is incredibly important. It is critical to note that the Macquarie Point Development Corporation went through a really credible process to plan for the Macquarie Point development, prior to the stadium project - prior to actually being forced and directed by this government to change that plan so that it could build a stadium. It identified a whole range of different developments - housing, communal areas, and the truth and reconciliation park that the government itself celebrated. 

The government itself acknowledged that in June 2022. The now Treasurer and the Premier went out and said that the Macquarie Point development - this was the previous one - provided a significant one-time-only opportunity for Hobart and Tasmania. The development was estimated to be worth $1 billion and would support almost 10,000 jobs during construction alone.

That was the previous development plan. That is the plan that we as a government and we as a taxpayer paid out a Melbourne-based developer to not develop housing on the area. It is clear that that is how you do planning. You consult the community, you come up with a viable plan and you make sure there are benefits across the sector.

This is a brownfield site. No one disagrees that this should be developed. No one is fighting over this to remain the way it is, because it is such an immense opportunity for the state. However, clearly the stadium is the wrong investment. It has come from the wrong place and it is in the wrong place, and the Planning Commission's report clearly highlights this.

In terms of urban form and planning, it identifies that it is completely inconsistent with this location for Hobart. In terms of the historic cultural heritage, it is going to have an impact on heritage values including the Cenotaph, which under any other circumstances is a sacred place. It has heritage implications, and transport and pedestrian safety implications. It also has unfunded elements that are built into it, and there are significant enabling bits of this stadium that are not even part of the application.

Now, we are hearing that there is going to be special legislation that changes the rules again - not even the POSS process, but we are going to have a pulp mill mark II to push this through. All of this is because the AFL is blackmailing this state.

[11.44 a.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I am very pleased to rise this morning and back in my colleague Janie Finlay on this really important matter of public importance.

What has this government become? Today, we heard from the Premier in Question Time deflecting back to the Labor-Greens government, years ago - deflecting that to our side of the House, when many of us were not even here during this time. That is just how irrelevant and desperate this government has become.

You only have to look at a quick history lesson, which I would give to the Premier this morning in his absence - an absence I have noted, given the fact that this matter of public importance is across each of his ministerial responsibility areas. He is not here to participate in the debate, and that says a lot.

Let us look at how Tasmania found itself in such a poor fiscal state and ended up with a government that has ideas but the distinct inability to deliver those ideas. This is a government that is caught up in its own red tape and over-regulated planning scheme, a government that cannot get anything done in this state. What a state the state of Tasmania finds itself in.

We have heard this morning that there is $25 billion of renewable energy investment on our doorstep, and this is a government that cannot deliver that. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=7.7_D=1.2_C=0.37]  It is appalling.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=10.2_D=17.0_C=0.86] Our budget position is debt and deficit as far as the eye can see, record debt and deficit and this government has no plan to fix it. This Treasurer has no plan to fix it except a one line answer which is a pathway to surplus, which means absolutely little to nothing.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=28.7_D=28.3_C=0.73] This government through its entire time in government has paced its whole existence on one liners. There is no substance, only political strategy and it is Tasmanians unfortunately that pay for that incompetence. The Liberals who inherited zero net debt from the Labor government, have wrecked the budget. It was imminent economists Saul Eslake who attributed these failings to the government itself. That is right, the government. He attributed these failures entirely to the policy decisions  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=57.9_D=2.4_C=0.76] taken and made by this government, honourable Speaker,  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=61.0_D=1.1_C=0.92] not the pandemic.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=63.6_D=20.1_C=0.83] This is a government that says it is backing investment, backing our AFL teams and backing in our tourism industry and yet they could not build a berth to back in their new vessels. honourable Speaker. That in itself tells the story of this government, a government that can deliver nothing.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=85.4_D=27.5_C=0.81] The government spent so much time consumed by its own self-preservation that it is responsible for the biggest infrastructure stuff up in history: no berth infrastructure for the new billion dollar Spirits and the Premier's pet project, the stadium, is shaping up much the same. Our teams are in jeopardy due to the government's inability to manage this stadium project.

Just last week, we heard that even a year on from when berth 3 was meant to be built and our ships were meant to be in service,  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=113.6_D=14.6_C=0.86] that not even the final design of the infrastructure and the terminal are complete. They are yet to be determined. Can you believe it, honourable Speaker? What hope is there of Tasmanians having any confidence in this inept government to deliver this project?  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=128.3_D=20.9_C=0.82] None, and this is the most important infrastructure project in the state's history. All Tasmanians want is for this government to get on and build that berth so that their Spirits can berth and that the economic benefits that will flow from that will be felt by Tasmanians. It is pretty simple. It is a fundamental role and responsibility of government.  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=150.8_D=7.9_C=0.76] 

This state and our economy, and as Ms Finlay said in her contribution, the foundation of this state was built on industrialisation, [Bookmark: Phr12_O=159.3_D=25.9_C=0.78]  enabled by natural assets and publicly owned state assets and in particular cheap hydroelectricity schemes and generation and deep water ports. I am the beneficiary of that through my family's involvement in the pulp and paper making industry in Burnie. Our heritage is built on these assets and public ownership of these assets and Tasmanians are proud of their industrial heritage and their industrial future.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=186.1_D=3.4_C=0.75] Our major industrials are critical to our economy and to jobs  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=189.9_D=24.2_C=0.80] and for working Tasmanian families and we need a government that will provide leadership on that uncertainty that currently exists at Bell Bay and Nyrstar. This uncertainty combined with geopolitical uncertainty when it comes to trade and international relations are a very important considerations for this government. It was not until this morning in Question Time that I have even heard the Premier speak about those geopolitical forces.

Time Expired.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=220.3_D=24.7_C=0.83] Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, it is really important when we are talking about tourism, trade, and major investment that we are looking at things that not only complement business investment in our state and supporting businesses starting up but then can also help the community in general. When we are looking at all of these investment decisions, are we getting the fundamentals and essentials right before we move on to non-essential projects such as the stadium?

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=246.2_D=2.6_C=0.91] We in this state have a serious digital  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=249.3_D=25.8_C=0.87] divide. It is the expectation that in 2025 there is basic connectivity for people in rural areas. Even in fairly peri-urban areas in Tasmania there is a connectivity issue and that affects confidence not only for the community but also for businesses. How can businesses start-ups come to this state if they cannot be guaranteed that they can have reliable Internet connectivity?

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=276.2_D=4.3_C=0.80] In the Australian Digital Inclusion Index, it confirms that Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr19_O=280.9_D=24.0_C=0.86]  is the second most digitally disadvantaged state or territory in this country, having languished the bottom of that table for the last decade. It identifies that one in four Tasmanians face some form of barrier to digital inclusion, and that 54,000 Tasmanians are either unable to get online or, if they can, they do not have the digital literacy to confidently navigate the online world.

The Tasmanian Council of Social Services (TasCOSS) recently published its budget priority statement for 2025-26, 'Digital Inclusion: Tackling the Digital Divide'. The report included a number of recommendations that this government should be prioritising to bridge the digital divide. This includes working with industry, working with communities and consumers to fix this widespread problem, reducing the cost of telecommunications, supporting the Tasmanian ICT industry in building scam cybersecurity and artificial intelligence awareness into digital literacy programs.

This is beyond future-proofing for our state at this point; this is playing catch-up. These are absolutely fundamental things. We have people here paying 2025 prices for connectivity, for the phone and for the internet with 1990s quality connectivity. That is not their fault.

The minister can sit here and say, 'It is a federal issue; we are doing all of this' - then why, in 2025 at the Cygnet Folk Festival, was there a loss of reception? Tasmanian businesses were losing business because the EFTPOS machines were cutting out. This happens every summer in Swansea. We know that this happens in St Helens.

Ms Ogilvie - Have you talked to Telstra?

The SPEAKER - Minister Ogilvie.

Ms BADGER - They should talk to Telstra - believe me, minister, they are talking to the big networks. They are trying to find this solution and they need your help. It is an essential service. It is your job to help them.

On the Tasman Peninsula, Port Arthur - when the population changes, when it is tourism season, they see cruise ships come in and there is an overload on their network. We have heard the mayor speak out about this quite a lot recently. There has been a community meeting. I know there were several members in this place who attended the community meeting on the Tasman Peninsula, trying to get help. They have seen cases where emergency services have not had connectivity to know that there is an emergency in their area to go and help. That is completely unacceptable in 2025. We have to be making sure that we have basic investment into community infrastructure that is complementary to the tourism space also.

For example, last sitting fortnight in this place we tabled a petition on behalf of residents in Swanwick and Coles Bay. There were 414 people who signed that petition calling for a safe cycleway and walking track to connect Swanwick and Coles Bay. These are towns that are incredibly close together, but the local families - it is a growing community, there are lots of people, various ages and abilities - just want to be able to walk or cycle safely between the two towns, to be able to go to the shop on their bike. Otherwise they are stuck on a main road with huge amounts of tourist traffic going into the Freycinet National Park. That would be a tremendous complementary piece of infrastructure to have in place for those communities, and to boost Freycinet National Park which is a wonderful nature-based tourism destination.

We have to get the essentials right in this state before we do other things. That means ensuring that there is essential infrastructure in place for Tasmanians for the future.

[11.54 a.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to support my colleague, the member for Bass, on this matter of public importance. Another day where we see the supposed conviction politician in the Premier missing from the action in here. There is an opportunity for him to speak on his portfolio areas and he has squibbed it. Some conviction he has.

We had the Treasurer earlier living on a different planet, quoting statistics, thinking that everything was all rosy when we know for a fact it is not. The Tasmanian economy is flatlining. We have public services that are at breaking point and some of the worst outcomes in the country, in health and education. There are too many Tasmanians who cannot put a roof over their head.

Unfortunately, we now have this mass migration to the mainland. We are losing skilled people, hardworking Tasmanians who have lost faith in this government's ability to manage the economy. They are looking for better opportunities on the big island. That is a tragedy for all of us. That means that they are not here contributing their skills to the economy. They are not paying taxes which help deliver the services that we all rely upon.

If you do not believe me, it was the TCCI themselves who famously said last year that it will be difficult to trust this government again because of the major stuff-up in the Devonport berth. How do you spend a billion dollars on two new ships and not get the port infrastructure ready for their service? In fact, they are only just understanding the project now. They are just finalising the designs well after the delivery date of Spirit of Tasmania IV. It is an absolute unmitigated disaster. It has impacted the tourism industry. It is impacting our economy. There are many challenges ahead.

Today, we heard about the challenges with our major industrials. These are major industrials that have underpinned the Tasmanian economy for over 100 years in some cases. This is a question not just of economic opportunity for Tasmanians, but also a question around sovereignty, national security, and whether we want to continue making things here. Yes, there are market forces at play, but some of those markets are being impacted by other governments who are heavily subsidising their smelters in their countries. It is impacting our Tasmanian businesses. We need to make sure that in these challenging environments we have a government that is up to the task and can support them.

What is our government doing? Raising power prices. One of the biggest inputs into these businesses is energy costs, and what are they doing? They are hiking up the prices - 20 per cent last year and a 10 per cent hike on the way. It is impacting businesses like Nyrstar in my electorate, a business and a major industrial I know well and that I have been visiting for many, many years. Nyrstar contributes $513 million to the Tasmanian economy. It has a direct spend of $292 million. It supports 1891 direct and indirect jobs. It supports 304 local businesses. This is direct from Nyrstar's 2024 Economic Value report. We know it has a capacity to produce 280,000 tonnes of zinc. It is operating well below capacity at the moment, a 25 per cent reduction and a very concerning situation not just for my electorate at Clark, but all of Tasmania. We know that there is a critical project that they need to develop: the cell room. We need to make sure that this government is supporting that business and supporting local workers and the economy. It is a great business. It is a business that has operated for over 100 years. It is a business that has improved over time in terms of its environmental impact.

We also heard today about Liberty Bell Bay, which contributes close to $500 million to the Tasmanian economy. It is a business that is very important to the north of the state. I spoke about my family's business in my inaugural speech, Glasgow Engineering. I know Glasgow Engineering has had a long relationship with that smelter doing work for them. That is just one example of the local businesses that benefit from these major industrials. Making sure that they continue to operate in Tasmania is very important.

[11.59 a.m.]
Mr FAIRS (Bass) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to rise and speak on this MPI on tourism, trade, and major investment. I am happy to reaffirm our government's unwavering commitment to expanding and diversifying Tasmania's trade markets. Trade is the lifeblood of our economy: driving growth, supporting businesses and strengthening regional communities. It is vital that we continue to seize new opportunities to showcase the best of Tasmania on the global stage.

It is an increasingly interconnected world. Broadening our trading horizons is not just beneficial, it is essential. By diversifying our markets, we enhance economic resilience, reduce exposure to external shocks, and unlock new growth opportunities for our exporters and importers.

I am pleased to report that this week Tasmanian food and beverage brands have made their mark in Singapore's premium grocery retailer, Little Farms. Through a series of events and pop-up stalls, Tasmanian products are being introduced to Singaporean consumers, expanding our reach into high value international markets. This partnership with Little Farms was established during a premier-led trade mission in late 2022, when Tasmanian premium products were introduced to their shelves. Today, I am delighted to announce that even more of our world-class produce will be showcased across all Little Farm supermarkets in Singapore, ensuring consumers have access to the finest Tasmanian products.

From 4-7 April, Tasmanian producers will be featured in a curated program that includes a Tasmanian food and wine fair, in-store sampling, exclusive showcase dinners and special promotions. Little Farms, renowned for its commitment to natural, healthy and organic produce, is an ideal partner to share Tasmania's rich culinary heritage with the world. Over the coming days, we expect thousands of people to experience Tasmania's premium products first-hand through initiatives like this. We are strengthening our reputation as a leader in quality, sustainability and innovation.
The nine Tasmanian businesses participating in this program include: Taylor & Smith, Three Friends Abalone, Tasman Sea Salt, Woodbridge Smokehouse, Haddow and Dineen, Bruny Island Cheese and Beer Co, Storm and India, Tasmanian Tonic Company, and exclusively Tasmanian leatherwood honey through the Tasmanian Active Honey Group.

Diversifying our trading markets is a strategic necessity. Over-reliance on a limited number of trade partners exposes us to risks like economic downturns, natural disasters and policy changes that can disrupt exports. Expanding into new markets provides stability and mitigates these vulnerabilities. 

Furthermore, tapping into emerging economies, such as a rapidly growing middle class in South-East Asia, opens significant opportunities for our food and beverage exports, education services and advanced manufacturing sectors. By fostering trade relationships in these regions, we create new pathways for Tasmanian businesses, generating jobs and strengthening our economy.

To fully capitalise on these opportunities, our government remains committed to four key strategic actions: expanding free trade agreements; strengthening export support; delivering targeted trade missions; and investing in infrastructure. Efficient trade requires world-class infrastructure. We understand that modern and efficient infrastructure is critical for reducing import and trade costs, improving supply chain reliability and ensuring that our goods reach global markets swiftly and competitively.

This is why we remain steadfast in our commitment to major infrastructure programs like the Marinus Link project, new irrigation schemes, and rail and road upgrades. This is also why we are supporting the Hobart International Airport with its infrastructure upgrade and introduced $5 million towards an aviation fund to attract new airlines and direct connections to Tasmania.

The benefits of diversifying our trade markets are undeniable. It enhances economic stability, fosters growth, drives innovation and ensures Tasmania's continued success in a competitive global landscape. Our government is committed to maintaining agile and forward-thinking trade policies that respond to both challenges and opportunities on the world stage. Together, let us seize the vast opportunities beyond their traditional trade partners and build a stronger more dynamic future for team Tasmania.

MOTION

Tasmania's Finances

Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Deputy Speaker, I will be requiring a vote. I move -

That the House -

Acknowledges the work of economist Saul Eslake in the 'Independent Review of Tasmania's State Finances' and notes the recommendations within the report to enhance financial stewardship and accountability in Tasmania.

Calls on the Government to implement the following initiatives, including introducing legislation, amendments or issuing Treasurer’s Instructions where necessary, to improve the management and transparency of Tasmania’s finances:

including 10-year projections of net debt and fiscal balance aggregates into the budget papers;

releasing more thorough economic information and analysis as part of the budget papers, similar to the 'NT Economy Book' published by the Northern Territory Government;

enhancing the 'Revised Estimates Report' with detailed analysis of recent developments in, and the outlook for, the Tasmanian economy;

amending the 'Revised Estimates Report' reporting date from February to December, in line with other states and territories; and

including a Policy & Parameter statement within the 'Treasurer’s Annual Financial Report'. (1 April 2025)

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.8_D=24.4_C=0.77]  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=70.6_D=29.4_C=0.82] This motion is something I have been considering for a number of weeks following the release of the Eslake report. Mr Eslake and I, and I am sure many members of parliament, had an ongoing conversation on ideas about the conduct of the Treasury and the reporting of the state budget and state finances, and also about broader economic and social issues that impact Tasmania. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=100.4_D=5.4_C=0.77]  I do not always agree with Mr Eslake on some of his  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=107.5_D=22.5_C=0.76] solutions or recommendations. He has a long history and he comes from a certain school of economics. However, when someone makes good solid recommendations that will improve the level of information provided to the Parliament of Tasmania and the people of Tasmania, more importantly, we should consider them. 

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=130.5_D=29.2_C=0.83] In his report provided to the government, initiated under the Jacqui Lambie Network negotiation, a number of his sensible recommendations should be adopted by government. Hence the reason for this motion. I have done it in a way where I am not calling you to spend money. I am asking you to implement initiatives in a range of ways which are possible - Treasury instructions,  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=160.3_D=23.8_C=0.82] legislation, amendments to existing bills, et cetera.

For background, the review provided a raft of important economic findings while making several recommendations that ought to be considered. This motion calls on the government to implement a select number of the simple recommendations made within the report. As the motion notes, implementing these simple changes will require activity from the government. I forecast that there will be a reasonable period of time for the government to implement this if this motion is agreed to today. We will talk about what that reasonable time is, but hopefully by the end of the year. 

Obviously, it may be difficult to achieve for this budget cycle, but I think a reasonable period of time by the end of the year in preparation for the following year is a reasonable request. The motion does not dictate that, but I will foreshadow that if it is not acted on in what I believe is a reasonable time, then we will be back here.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=228.0_D=3.6_C=0.77] The motion calls on the government to introduce the following five initiatives, including 10-year [Bookmark: Phr12_O=232.4_D=27.7_C=0.88]  projections of net debt and fiscal balance aggregates into the budget papers. The Australian government already includes 10-year projections of key budget metrics in its budget papers, including the operating and fiscal balance, the cash balance, the net debt and the net financial liabilities. The Northern Territory has also recently included a medium-term fiscal outlook in its most recent set of budget papers, which stretches out to the 10 years. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=260.4_D=29.8_C=0.82]  Despite the inherent uncertainty and fluidity of 10-year projections, they nonetheless encourage longer term financial planning, while simultaneously providing a lot more accountability for expenditure commitments made in a budget or in an election that include funding beyond the forward Estimates. 

The second point is releasing more thorough economic information and analysis as a part of the budget papers, similar to the NT Economy Book  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=290.4_D=14.6_C=0.80] published by the Northern Territory government. While Treasury includes some economic information within budget paper 1, this chapter is limited and includes projections for just seven key economic variables. As Mr Eslake has noted in his review, this is insufficient compared to some other jurisdictions. Treasury's detailed insight into the performance and outlook for the Tasmanian economy would be immensely useful, and would provide Tasmanians and the Tasmanian government decision-makers with high-quality information to aid sensible and responsible financial decision-making.

The motion references the NT Economy Book, which is published as a part of the Northern Territory government's budget papers. This is a 68-page publication - the most recent one was 68 pages - and it is rich with information and projections on all sorts of important economic indicators, including the residential housing market, wages and prices, which do have economic impacts on people's lives and which are impacted by government decision-making.

Point (c): Enhancing the Revised Estimates Report (RER)with detailed analysis of recent developments in, and the outlook for the Tasmanian economy. This is an extension of part 2 above, or (b) in the motion. It calls for the RER published by Treasury in February each year to include detailed analysis of recent developments impacting the Tasmanian economy. The RER is governed by section 36 of the Financial Management Act 2016, which outlines the minimum information to be included within the RER and the date in which the report is to be published. Subsection 36(7) allows for the Treasurer to include other financial or statistical information within the RER as the Treasurer sees fit. This act may require amendment to comply with this part of the motion.

Point (d): Amending the Revised Estimates Report reporting date from February to December, in line with other states and territories. It would be beneficial if the reporting date for the RER was brought forward, from no later than 15 February to sometime in December. Actioning this may require an amendment to section 36 of the Financial Management Act 2016. Changing this date would align Tasmania with every other state and territory, and also the federal government's mid-year economic and fiscal outlook.

The RER is typically published on the same day as the December quarterly report, which shares the same legislated due date of 15 February, under section 37 of the Financial Management Act. It is not necessary that the RER be published on the same day as the December quarterly report, and it is not practical to bring forward a reporting date of the latter.

The final point is: Including a policy and parameter statement within the Treasurer's annual financial report. The policy and parameter statements, which are included in the annual budget papers and RER reports, are very useful documents. They explain variances between estimates or outcomes in one budget to the next. Changes are categorised as either being a result of policy decisions, i.e. a result of conscious government decision-making, or parameter variations, i.e. changes to economic and other assumptions.

Including this statement within the Treasurer's annual financial report will provide a clearer picture of why the budgeted expenditure and incomes for that year were different from the actual observed outcomes. Given the significant variance between budgeted and actual outcomes over the last few years, and noting the scale of supplementary appropriations bills we have recently seen - and some of them are eye-watering, this is more important than ever. 

As Mr Eslake's report notes, Tasmania's policy and parameter statements are widely considered to be the best of any Australian jurisdiction, so including it within the Treasury's annual financial report is a sensible measure that will improve financial accountability.

I know a number of members in this House have focused on Mr Eslake's recommendations and reviews. Given the state of the parliament, with the crossbench being as active as they are, and their ability to provide constructive recommendations to government, I would see this motion, and the recommendations from Mr Eslake we are echoing - I am not parroting all of Mr Eslake's recommendations but, rather, picking up a number of points where I feel, and I am hopeful I will get the support of the House today, will improve the economic literacy and understanding of the state of Tasmania's budget.

We know Tasmania's budget and the role of government has great importance not only to service delivery, which is obvious, but also, sometimes undervalued, on the Tasmanian economy because we are disproportionately larger in terms of that activity comparable to other states.

If the Northern Territory can acknowledge that this information is important and other jurisdictions can, I think this is a sensible reform. Where we can see variations, we can see trends. When we are having a debate and a discussion around, not only the financial circumstances of the state on the books, but also those of the government business enterprises and state-owned companies and in the context of the broader economy, you would argue that it would provide you with a far greater and a more refined level of debate in terms of a contest of ideas, which this House should promote and the community should promote.

When I was in a different role, I remember receiving a number of reports from the Treasury giving some frank and fearless advice about the state of the books, and also the Treasury's report on the future that gave the short, medium and long-term fiscal position of the state. It gave optimistic assessments of where the books are heading - the mid-range -  as Treasury do, and they are very good at the pessimistic approach in terms of their predictions of where the state budget and the economy will go.

I think having more information in the public domain, allowing Treasury to provide that advice and to provide it in a transparent way, enables all of us in this place, and the broader community, a greater set of details and facts at hand to debate - either to lift up an idea and to support it in the context of the state of the finances, or to point out where there is a level of concern. There is no budget that is presented without risk. There is no decision that government makes that is without a level of risk. 

It is important that the state and the community of Tasmania know that those of us who are here debating during Estimates, during the budget sessions and beyond, and in the various cycles where we would receive this extra information, have the information to enable us to have a coherent debate based on facts. If there is a manipulation - and we know there are always stats and people can manipulate them - then people outside of this place can make a value judgment around the content of our arguments and whether they believe us or not.

I know there was a motion - and I am not reflecting on a vote of the House. I know that there was a different motion moved, or potentially moved earlier in this year's sitting - that needed to be debated in an appropriate way. That is why I have waited to my private members' time to bring this debate forward. It is a different motion. It is a motion that reflects the elements of the Eslake report that I think should be adopted by government.

It also confirms my view that has been building over my period of time in this place that this kind of information, and the work of the Treasury, should not be seen as closed off and only able to be provided to the government of the day. Treasury can do a body of work - despite me, in a previous role, being on budget committee, and not agreeing with Treasury officials. They have a fundamentally important role to play in terms of providing us with advice so that we can make better decisions as a parliament.

I know that there are other members who will seek to speak on this motion. It has been indicated to me that there is a level of support for that, and I hope that sustains this debate and a vote if we require one, or if there is a division - hopefully not. I think this is a pretty sensible approach. It acknowledges the lifetime advocacy of Mr Eslake and his passion for financial and economic literacy of parliamentarians in the broader community. I acknowledge the work he has done on this. He has been passionate; he is very articulate about this. As I said, I qualify that support. I do not always agree with Mr Eslake and I am sure he does not always agree with me. That is the great thing about the democracy that we live in. 

I think the motion is a reasonable motion. I will not talk out my time. I think it is important that other people provide contributions. The context of this is the financial situation that the state finds itself in.  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.6_D=4.7_C=0.83] We are not the only state that finds itself in this kind of  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=37.2_D=8.9_C=0.85] financial situation. Whilst I acknowledge the impact of the global financial crisis, it is clear that there have been decisions [Bookmark: Phr4_O=47.1_D=16.0_C=0.83] , because we are two or three years out of that cycle. That is a foundation, but I remember standing up in the middle of COVID agreeing to allocations and actually arguing that we probably were not allocating enough.

I think that the previous [Bookmark: Phr5_O=63.3_D=28.4_C=0.82]  treasurer came through with a number of supplementary appropriation bills to allocate more money, because when a community is in a crisis such as a pandemic, it all of a sudden reminds people about the importance of government and the importance of providing good quality services, keeping us safe, keeping us healthy and keeping us educated, and all the other elements that are important to a state budget. 

Whilst COVID  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=92.6_D=2.8_C=0.74] provides context to this budget situation of where we are, there have been a number of budget cycles now where I think decisions have been made which have not made the situation we find ourselves in better. My response now is not to use my position on the crossbench [Bookmark: Phr8_O=112.1_D=12.0_C=0.89]  to attack and to undermine, but to promote sensible ideas that improve and lift the level of debate to a point where information is shared. Once that information is received, and the greater level of information and the granular detail that these reports and recommendations will hopefully produce, the debate will focus more clearly and give justification for various arguments, as opposed to the noise that we hear occasionally. It is all good or it is all bad, and we all know it is neither of those things.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=142.9_D=13.2_C=0.83] Deputy Speaker, it is a pleasure to move this motion. I seek support of the House and I look forward to the debate.


[12.23 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=157.3_D=28.3_C=0.82] Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Treasurer) - Deputy Speaker, I want to first thank the member for bringing forward this motion. I make it clear on behalf of the government that we will not be opposing the motion. I want to make it clear that I as Treasurer, with others, on behalf of the government have been working very hard to progress many of the objectives, principles and initiatives that you have referred to in the motion and in your remarks today.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=186.3_D=1.1_C=0.90] 

I also want to [Bookmark: Phr13_O=187.8_D=25.5_C=0.79]  say thank you for your interest in this matter. It is important for not just us as a government but also for the parliament and our community. I know the motivations are very positive and well made, and I look forward to working with you as I look forward to working with others across this Chamber to provide improvement in how we deliver on our economic management in Tasmania, and deliver on  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=214.2_D=4.4_C=0.88] our fiscal and budget responsibility going forward.
 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=219.2_D=24.9_C=0.86] I wanted to acknowledge that up front. We want to strengthen the budget process at every turn and every opportunity, and that is certainly my ambition for improving transparency. As I say, we are already working on many of the initiatives that you outlined. I am working very hard on this at the moment with the Department of Treasury and my colleagues  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=244.7_D=3.8_C=0.90] across the Cabinet Budget Committee, and  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=248.8_D=27.7_C=0.87] directly with the Premier, of course. We are looking across all of the budget to ensure that we continue to deliver high-quality services in the most efficient way possible. 

I want to touch on your remarks about the economic headwinds at a national and global level. We know it is a big day tomorrow for President Trump and all of the trading partners with the United States in terms of how that may or may not impact on  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=277.4_D=4.6_C=0.70] global trade and our economies, but that is just one matter.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=283.3_D=21.7_C=0.79] You made reference to COVID and saving lives and saving livelihoods. I think as a government, but also as a parliament, we can be pleased and proud of the efforts that we all put in during that difficult time over a number of years. Of course, it does have a tail and it still has a flow-on effect. There was some $2 billion of investment on behalf of the taxpayers to save lives and livelihoods across our community.

As Attorney-General, and also as minister for Justice, I would like to acknowledge, as I do not believe you mentioned, the commission of inquiry. It is something very important. We are implementing all 191 recommendations. We take it very seriously, because it applies to, sadly, failures for and on behalf of government over more than four decades. It is our government's job and this parliament's job to now deliver on those recommendations. Of course, there was a significant investment in that regard.

Then you have cost of living. This is a top priority for our government and for our community. Cost of living, cost of doing business, all of these challenges - not to mention the economic headwinds that have been mentioned nationally. For example, we have had 12 interest rate rises in the last three years under the federal Labor government and one reduction in more recent times. That has had massive impacts on our community. The average home owner with the average mortgage is now paying an extra $29,000 as a result of those interest rate rises over that three-year period. That is tough, in terms of cost of living and cost of doing business.

Going forward, our position has been made very clear by the Premier and by myself that we want to spend every dollar wisely. We are definitely working to a long-term plan for this state. That is one of the reasons we are backing business and backing industry to grow the economy. One thing I have certainly learnt under John Howard and Peter Costello is that you need a growing economy to reinvest in those essential services, whether it be health, education, police, welfare, or the like. Housing, of course, is a very important one. You do need to deliver a stronger economy so that you can reinvest in those important essential services.

We are getting on with the job. I have made it clear over a long period of time, now, with the Premier and others, like Jane Howlett, of course, Minister for Small Business, in terms of cutting the red tape and streamlining the processes to let business get on and do their stuff. Yes, we have initiated the right-sizing of the state service. We have announced the efficiency and productivity unit. We will have more to say about that in the not-too-distant future.

We have talked about actioning the reforming of the government business enterprises. There has been debate earlier today on privatisation, including of our energy assets. The Leader of the Opposition appears to have changed his tune from what he has publicly put on the record less than a decade ago, and the Premier made that clear earlier today.

We are certainly a government of courage and conviction. On the other side, in terms of state Labor, it seems to be cowardice. We will no doubt hear more about that shortly.

Mr Willie - Are you going to talk about the motion?

Mr BARNETT - As I say, we will not be opposing the motion. We are already getting on with the job. You obviously do not like to hear the facts. We will not be lectured by the Shadow Treasurer or state Labor when it comes to the budget, because it was your government that raided the $1.5 billion of the superannuation guarantee -

Mr Willie - The state's finances have never been worse. We were never going to be lectured by you. Nearly $10 billion worth of debt.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr Willie, you have already received a warning from the Speaker.

Mr BARNETT - It was well and truly raided by your government when you were in government. There is no getting away from that. There is no credibility whatsoever in terms of state Labor when you made representations of the federal budget being responsible when it has a decade of deficits. We have a plan -

Mr Willie - What was left by the Liberal Party.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr Willie, this is the last time I will warn you.

Mr BARNETT - This is a plan for a pathway to surplus by 2029-30. We are getting on with the job. As I say, we take it very seriously. We have a very clear measured pathway. The Premier has made it clear we are plotting that pathway to surplus. We will continue to do so. You will see more on 29 May when the budget is handed down.

I can assure colleagues in this place that we are working very hard to ensure we will deliver a better future, to ensure that every dollar is wisely spent. We want to deliver economic growth and prosperity for Tasmanians, knowing that they are doing it tough, knowing that the cost of living is their top priority. It is clearly a priority issue in the federal election and it will continue to be going forward.

Tasmania is the best place in the world to work, live and raise a family but also it needs to be a place where business can prosper and do well, the best place to start and operate a business, and a great place to invest. That is what we are on about.

We have made some very crucial investments. We do have a 10-year fiscal strategy and the motion speaks to that and fleshes that out in terms of what more can be delivered in terms of that fiscal strategy and in terms of being open and transparent in the Budget papers. There has been a reference obviously to the Revised Estimates Report and what else can be included in that. I think they are good objectives.
I will be looking at that very carefully in terms of delivering on that in due course. Obviously, it will take time for Treasury to absorb and to work on it. I have already talked to my secretary about the matters that are included in the motion. We are taking it seriously. I want to make that very clear to the member who has moved the motion. We are looking forward to continuing the good work that we are doing to deliver a better budget environment for Tasmania.

It is not just, for example, reaching a financial target for the sake of it. The objective is to deliver a strong and resilient economy that will benefit all Tasmanians, so we can reinvest in those essential services. We want Tasmanians to be strong in the future, and in the 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's future, which we have delivered on and will continue to do so.

We have a clear plan. That is in contrast to the other side that has no plan, no alternative budget, no costed policies. It would be wonderful when that budget is delivered on 29 May to have an alternative budget from State Labor. I look forward to that with bated breath indeed.

In conclusion, we want to get on with the job of growing our economy, of delivering a very open and transparent budget and strong fiscal strategy well into the future. This is really what this motion is about: setting out parameters, projections in terms of where we are going with our budget, with our fiscal balance, with our net debt, and a whole lot more.

There has been a reference to the Northern Territory Economy Book. I will be having a good look at that, and to see whatever else we can do because we have got to work together. I have said many times that we are a minority government, we want to work with the Parliament, and we need to collaborate, work together with good will, and to do that we are putting Tasmanians first: what is in the best interests of Tasmania, not just now or this year, but for the long term. If we can all work together with goodwill, we can get the job done.

I want to thank again the honourable member for bringing forward this motion and we certainly will not be opposing it.

[12.34 p.m.]
Mr WILLIE - Deputy Speaker, I acknowledge that I am lucky to still be here. I will keep my comments fairly short because I am aware there are a number of other members who want to speak within the short timeframe.

I thank the member for Franklin for bringing this motion forward and put on the record that I thank Saul Eslake for his report again. I have a lot of time for Saul. Saul is a prominent, well-respected Tasmanian. He is very passionately Tasmanian and he cares about the future of this state. When he speaks, I know that lots of Tasmanians take notice. He is not only prominent in Tasmania but internationally in terms of his expertise.

I know that he was quite disappointed, and he has been public about that, in terms of the government's response to his report. It is an interesting approach from the Treasurer just now, that he will support this motion, when he failed to acknowledge some of these fiscal guardrail recommendations and outlined a proactive approach from the government, which could have adopted some of these things and got to work straightaway.

In terms of there being no cost to this, I do not agree with that. I have heard the member for Franklin, in a previous role, talk about how Tasmania has a finance department, not necessarily a treasury department and that we do need to beef up Treasury in terms of its economic analysis and reporting. To do that you have to invest in Treasury and the expertise in Treasury so there will be some cost to this, but I think you have to spend money to save money in some instances. The trajectory of the state's finances under this government are in perilous shape and we cannot continue on the path that they are taking us. We need more rigour around the economic debate in this state and some of these recommendations will help to contribute to that.

Regarding each point in the motion, including 10-year projections and net debt and fiscal balance aggregates into the budget papers, that is actually Labor policy. Last year we acknowledged the state of Tasmania's finances and announced a 10-point plan for budget repair. We did take notice of Saul's recommendations and adopted some of those into our policy. In terms of 10-year projections being uncertain and fluid, in some instances, this government cannot even get four-year projections right and I have got an example of that. For example, their forecasting is so off, and this is no reflection on Treasury because I think they are being instructed at times by this government to mask the truth. Here is an example. In 2022, they projected a net operating balance for 2023-24 to be a surplus of $19.1 million. A year later, they predicted a $297 million deficit. Then in the revised estimates that followed that, they were projecting a $521 million deficit. They actually delivered the biggest deficit in the state's history, $1.5 billion. That is how quickly their projections deteriorated. They were projecting a $19.1 million surplus and they ended up with the biggest deficit in the state's history. This government cannot get four-year projections right, let alone 10.

That is no reflection on Treasury because I think that they are being directed at times to mask the incompetence of this Government and what does that mean? It means massive blowouts. We just had a half a billion-dollar supplementary appropriation bill in this parliament. In Estimates, with the former treasurer there was a bit of tit for tat with myself and him and I was saying, 'Well, you are about to embark on the biggest austerity budget in more than 20 years or you are going to have budget blowouts, and that is almost certain,' and he took issue with that. The government cannot even manage a budget for five months and it is asking for half a billion dollars on the credit card. Again, it was entirely predictable because their forward Estimates are full of black holes. I hope that this Treasurer actually does something about that, rather than masking the truth all the time, because we will end up with supplementary appropriation after supplementary appropriation because their expenditure growth is not believable.

I have been through this in the House before, but the former treasurer's efforts in terms of expenditure, 8.5 per cent growth, then he went on to 14.7 per cent growth in terms of government expenditure, and then in the Budget that he delivered, it was predicting -3.5 per cent growth for the first year, -2.7 per cent, 1.5 per cent, and then -1.2 per cent. It has never been done in the last 20 years at least, when I looked back into it. Yes, we support the 10-year projections as part of our policy, but there are some significant issues that I hope this Treasurer seeks to address in the upcoming Budget.

Enhancing the Revised Estimates Report: I did have a quick look at the Northern Territory Economy Book and I think something like that would be good, but acknowledging that it will take further resources from Treasury to implement some of those things. Then there is obviously some points there around reporting dates, noting that every other jurisdiction, federal and state and territories, manage to do their revised estimates report in December and they do that without half-yearly results, so there is no reason why our Treasury cannot do that.

Then obviously the last point there in terms of the policy and parameter statement within the Treasurer's annual financial report: I do note Mr Eslake's commentary around ours being some of the best in the country and that is a good thing. In Saul Eslake's report into the state's finances, he mentioned another economist, Chris Richardson, I believe, who talked about that table in the Budget being the table of truth where you can see where it may have gone wrong for the government in terms of their policy changes or whether there were things outside of their control in terms of parameters that may have affected the government and the finances.

This is all in the context of a number of concerning things. We have got the credit rating agencies breathing down our neck, we have a fiscal strategy that was not worth the paper it was written on because the government had no intention of abiding by some of their own fiscal strategy, in fact, most of it. You had the credit rating agencies effectively saying there was no fiscal discipline, weakening governance. S&P, in particular, has set a threshold of 120 per cent of debt to operating revenue for a downgrade and, I believe Moody's followed that up with a similar ratio - theirs was a little bit higher.

We have some major issues in this state with respect to the state's finances, which is entirely under the stewardship of this government. It is interesting to hear the Treasurer saying that he is acknowledging that the government is in minority and that we need to work together. This is a government that wants to take the credit for the good things and share the blame for the things they have not got right - and the state's finances they have not got right. It is not just me saying it. Saul Eslake himself said that the deteriorating position of the state's finances are entirely down to Liberal Party policy settings. They have taken us off the cliff. I certainly support more rigorous reporting. I support spending some money in Treasury to support them in additional work that they will be required to do through this because we do need to lift the economic debate.

There are other measures in Saul Eslake's report that could be implemented. For example - and the member for Clark over there is on the Public Accounts Committee too - we did go to the mainland recently and have a look at and engage with some parliamentary budget officers, which I found to be a very informative and valuable trip. I know there is another member of this House who has a motion before the parliament on that particular matter and some other matters, noting, an inquiry of the Public Accounts Committee is taking place so I am not sure about some of the process issues there when you have a committee looking into it, and a member who has not asked any Budget questions, then suddenly has decided that they care about the Budget, that they had to move an urgent motion. They misrepresented that in the media saying that the Labor Party and other members of this House had voted against her motion. It is sitting on the books still. Use your private members time. You did not make the case for it being urgent, you have not asked any Budget questions and then you are asking the parliament to do something while a committee is looking into it in detail.

We will have that debate, no doubt, when that member brings forward that motion. That is also Labor Party policy and I would encourage the Treasurer to adopt a parliamentary budget office. It would lift the economic debate. He is talking about alternative budgets. I will note that no other Opposition - 

Members interjecting.

Mr WILLIE - Did Peter Dutton and Angus Taylor just deliver an alternative budget? No, they did not.

Mr Bayley - We will. We are happy to.

Mr WILLIE - They are happy to. It is a work of fiction. It is absolutely full of holes every time and it is very entertaining to read. It does involve a few chuckles. Thanks for the entertainment, Greens, but you cannot be taken seriously about financial matters because you live in an alternative universe.

A parliamentary budget office would be highly beneficial to our democracy and I would be interested in the Treasurer's thoughts about that. I have heard some rumours that he is quite supportive of a parliamentary budget office and he wants to see some improvements in that area. I will be interested when we have that debate in what he actually says, because it is Labor policy. It was a recommendation of Saul Eslake's report as well, and I think that,  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=11.0_D=19.1_C=0.86] given the state's finances, we need to put some more guardrails in, we need to put some more supports around decision making, and we need to make sure that the Budget is managed in a responsible way so that future generations are not disadvantaged. That is effectively what this government has done.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.6_D=8.8_C=0.73] It has mortgaged the state's future. There are difficult decisions because they have not been able to manage the Budget in a responsible way.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=40.4_D=26.2_C=0.85] When 65 per cent of our revenue comes from the federal government, you need to be very responsible in the way that you spend money because our own source revenue is such a small proportion of the budget. We are not in control of our own destinies like other states, like Victoria and New South Wales and, to a certain extent, Queensland and Western Australia where they have more levers and adjustments to policy that they can make.  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=67.4_D=4.4_C=0.84] We are very reliant on the federal government, and that means you have to be responsible.  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=72.4_D=15.0_C=0.70] We have not had that from this government in recent times. As Saul Eslake has said himself, it is going to be Tasmanians who get hurt through that mismanagement. That is very unfortunate. I think  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=89.3_D=6.8_C=0.86] future generations of Tasmanians will be talking about this government, just like they do Robin Gray [Bookmark: Phr8_O=98.0_D=24.2_C=0.72] , when Robin Gray took the state's finances into a perilous state. People still talk about that. I think the Rockliff Liberal government will be talked about in the same way. 

In summary, we do support these fiscal guardrail measures. I thank the member for bringing them forward and acknowledge that  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=124.1_D=15.6_C=0.87] we need to support Treasury through this. It will support members of parliament and other people who want to contribute to the debate in Tasmania to be more informed and hopefully this government can get on with it sooner rather than later.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=144.8_D=8.1_C=0.81] Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I thank the member for bringing this motion on. It is a very constructive and positive  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=153.3_D=30.0_C=0.76] motion. Listening to the Treasurer give his support - it was not exactly support - but he was not going to oppose this. It begs the question: why is it that we need an independent member, or anyone else on the crossbench for that matter, to use their private members' time to pass a motion to force the government to take up some good measures? These things have been put on the public record by Saul Eslake in a report that the government itself actually commissioned.  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=186.4_D=27.4_C=0.83] The report included really good, constructive, limited cost measures that can improve transparency, accountability, and everybody's financial and budget literacy, for that matter, and yet the government does not step up to the plate and actually take them up and implement them unless this parliament calls on them, or forces them, or orders them. 

I think that is a real shame and I invite the Treasurer to reflect on that, and,  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=214.4_D=29.6_C=0.78] instead of commissioning these kinds of reports to just gather dust, to actually read them, to actually pick out the bits that you can support, or not oppose for that matter, and actually put them into place. The fact that we have to use private members' time in this place to actually make the case and force you into taking these things up is an indictment on the proactivity of this government in recognising positive suggestions and actually embracing them to make things better. This is  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=244.2_D=20.4_C=0.81] not only for yourselves, in terms of how you manage the budget, but for everybody in this place, and outside of this place, so we can understand that. 

We are in a mess. The Budget is in a mess, and we do need to do something about it. Saul Eslake's report was a real wake up call. The last  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=266.4_D=27.8_C=0.70] supplementary budget and appropriation bill that we discussed and debated earlier included revised estimates reporting a $500 million blowout to make the deficit $1.3 billion, and debts up to $9.6 billion by 2028. That is going to cost us $500 million a year to service and, according to Saul Eslake's calculations, that will jump to $16 billion in in 2035, costing us $735 billion to service. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=294.8_D=10.2_C=0.83]  We are in a perilous situation here and there is no clear pathway to surplus. It is a complete fallacy; it is a complete mirage. 

Saul Eslake is really clear that we need to encourage the Treasurer to distinguish when it comes to surplus between the net operating balance and the cash balance. Saul has described the most recent budget as a triumph of politics over economics, and he sheets home the challenges in the Tasmanian budget entirely to policy issues. Yes, we have had COVID; yes, we have had the commission of inquiry where we absolutely need to respond financially to address issues, but Saul has put it very clearly down to the policy decisions of this government. He states in his report that finances deteriorating began before the onset of the pandemic and have continued after it. 

Policy decisions of this government are driving the budget crisis and we need to do something about it. I have talked already in this place this morning and yesterday about the stadium, and that is one policy decision that is clearly ill informed, ill-advised and is going to create a whole raft of different issues in relation to not only the economy but the very city that some of us live in and represent.

Going through the initiatives in this motion, they are all supportable. They will increase the level of transparency, accountability and literacy when it comes to the budget, but Saul's recommendations were not necessarily limited to these five recommendations that are in this motion. Saul also recommended that we set an infrastructure budget and then prioritise infrastructure spend. Underneath that he recommended that we increase revenue, including things like raising our mining and mineral royalties. He described vacancy control and efficiency dividends as very lazy and ineffective mechanisms, and of course, there are other initiatives that would cost a moderate amount of money, things like a parliamentary budget office that would assist again with the parliament understanding the budget. 

I acknowledge that that is in another member's motion that I understand will come to this place, so we will get the opportunity to debate that and I have chosen not to, in the context of this motion, try to amend this motion to include some of these other initiatives. We look forward to that debate in due course. 

There are also the recommendations of the Integrity Commission, and making sure that the indirect electoral bribery that comes through so strongly in past election campaigns from this Liberal government is not a feature of future election campaigns. The Integrity Commission was really clear about this. In layman's terms, this is called pork-barrelling.

I am going to wind it up, because I am conscious that there are other members who want to speak, but the government policies of selling GBEs and cutting the public service is not the way to go. We need structural reform when it comes to our budget, and we need to increase investment in the things that matter to Tasmanians. I know we have already put significant amounts into health, but we clearly need to address outstanding issues when it comes to the health crisis.

The government's figures, when it comes to housing, are completely fudged and clearly there needs to be more investment there. Education has only just recently got 100 per cent of the schooling resource standard.

When you look at the State of the Environment report, you realise exactly what needs significant investment going forward. My colleague Cecily Rosol from Bass asked a question of the Premier this morning in relation to child safety, in relation to youth justice and in relation to children and young people - it is a fact that these services are critically underfunded, directly affecting the lives and the futures of our young people. 

Budgets are issues of priority. Budgets are all about what government values and what it, therefore, will invest in. We believe this government has it significantly wrong when it comes to the priorities it chooses, but certainly the initiatives contained in this motion will improve the level of accountability and transparency so that people can understand exactly what the government is doing and make up their own minds about the wisdom or otherwise of those investments. Again, I thank the member for bringing this on.

Certainly, from a Greens' perspective, we will be supporting it and see these as positive initiatives that will improve everybody's understanding of the budget going forward.

Deputy SPEAKER - Just as Mr Garland is coming to the dispatch box, I will point out that we have a little bit of time after lunch as well for those wishing to speak because we started after 12.00 p.m.

[12.55 p.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak in support of the motion and thank the independent member for Franklin for bringing it on. In my Budget reply speech last year, I expressed my frustration at the government's unwillingness to adopt any of the recommendations in the Eslake report.

I want to remind this government that at the end of February, I wrote an open letter to the Treasurer after the revised estimates report from Treasury was released, showing how bad our Budget situation was becoming. I implored the government to implement any or all of the Eslake recommendations and to stay away from spending cuts on education and health, or I would not be supporting the Budget. I wrote that I am not prepared to condemn future generations of Tasmanians to carrying this scale of debt, particularly when some of it comes from infrastructure projects we do not desperately need and cannot afford, i.e. the Macquarie Point Stadium, or are experiencing cost blowouts owing to poor management, i.e. the Spirit of Tasmania berth 3. 

As Mr Eslake has pointed out, the deterioration in Tasmania's public finances since the mid-2010s has been entirely attributable to government decisions to increase spending without any consideration being given as to how that spending should be paid for. This motion will not change that. It goes for what you might call 'low-hanging fruit'. These measures will cost the government nothing; they are not going to change the Budget position, but they will at least provide more information to inform public debate about our finances - and so, they are a good thing. However, I think we need to be realistic about whether these changes on their own will change the Budget trajectory. 

The Eslake report stimulated a lot of scrutiny and discussion. It clearly indicated the frightening financial trajectory of this state but it has not led to any changes in the Government's fiscal policy. It is readily apparent that the Government will not adopt the Eslake recommendations and will not change their fiscal approach unless we, as a Parliament, force them to. That requires more motions like this. In that regard, I look forward to Ms Johnston's motion next week. 

[12.58 p.m.]
Mrs BESWICK (Braddon) - Deputy Speaker, I welcome the chance to add to this debate, and I thank the member for Franklin for bringing it forward.

This House is well aware I have been underwhelmed by state government's response to Saul Eslake's excellent Budget report. It is clear they have respect for Mr Eslake; after all, he has been given the job of assessing and selling the state's assets. However, when it comes to taking on his advice, they seem to pick and choose - which is somewhat expected.

Saul Eslake's report not only put forward sensible ways to reduce spending, but he was also brave enough to suggest ways to raise additional revenue. The government's unwillingness to even model some of these ideas is very disappointing. The Budget situation warrants all ideas to be at least considered. We owe it to future generations to exhaust all options. I am very pleased to see members of the crossbench and the opposition pick up on Saul Eslake's work, and I swear he is mentioned here almost as often as the Premier. While I did not support a suspension of Standing Orders recently, some of those ideas put forward in the independent member for Clark's motion - that we will be debating later, possibly - are worthy initiatives.

If the government is reluctant to adopt ideas for budget reform, the parliament can make sure the issue stays on the political agenda. The initiatives put forward in this motion are all sensitive and will go a long way when it comes to transparency and installing the guardrails we will need for budget repair. Ten-year projections are more important than ever. We need to be making decisions today that will ease the burden on future generations, not leaving a mess to clean up. Ten years is quite common, at least in the corporate space and -

Sitting suspended from 1.00 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.





MOTION

Tasmania's Finances

Resumed from above.

[2.30 p.m.]
Mrs BESWICK (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, as I was saying, the call for more economic information is welcome. The Northern Territory document mentioned in the motion is, indeed, worth reading. It appears a very useful exercise and one that could be useful here. Enhancing the Revised Estimates Report is in line with Saul Eslake's recommendations. Bringing it forward to December will give the government of the day more time to implement necessary changes. All the ideas contained in this motion will, hopefully, focus the government and parliament's attention on the task of repairing the budget, and it creates rigour, as mentioned by the shadow treasurer.

If we are going to turn the budget round, it will take a team effort. We all have a role to play in making sure the precious funds are spent wisely. More accurate budget information in the public domain will be better. We need to be making public spending decisions with clear eyes, and everyone in public life has a responsibility to get their heads around the budget challenge. 

For me personally, the last 12 months have been eye-opening. Getting my head around the complexity of the budget process has been a challenge, but I am determined to play a constructive role. Tasmania's budget woes will not be solved by playing politics. It will take determination, compromise and constructive ideas. I thank the member for today's motion and see it as an important step towards budget repair. 

The SPEAKER - Thank you. Further speakers on the motion? 

Mr O'BYRNE - How many minutes do we have left?

The SPEAKER - We have about four minutes left. You can sum up, Mr O'Byrne.

Mr O'BYRNE - Unless there is anyone else who wants to have a have a bash at this?
———————————————————
Recognition of Visitors

The SPEAKER - I take the opportunity to formally welcome the students of grades 5-6 Deloraine Primary. We have a group in now and then they are swapping over with a group that have gone to the other much more boring place, without reflecting on the other House, of course, but lovely to see you.

Members - Hear, hear.
———————————————————
 [2.32 p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - We apologise in advance.

Honourable Speaker, in summing up, I thank the members collectively for their enthusiastic embracing of the motion regarding suggestions and changes to the Department of Treasury in their reporting on the budget and the fiscal position of the state and the broader economy. I acknowledge the comments made by all members in terms of recognising this as a sensible way forward and a sensible compromise for the House.

I acknowledge the backhanded compliment by my good friend, the member for Braddon, Mr Garland, who talked about this being low-hanging fruit. I did make the observation that I am not the tallest bloke around so, to me, this is achievable. In the days of politics and the debate around these days, just getting something done is better than getting nothing done. 

I acknowledge the contributions by all members and their support for this motion. I believe it is an important step forward. I look forward to the Treasurer updating the House and members in terms of the progress. He acknowledged in his contribution that work had already been done. I take that at face value and believe that it is a positive contribution.

I thank the House and members for their enthusiastic support of the recommendations in my motion from the Eslake report. 

Motion agreed to.


WAIVER OF PRIVATE MEMBERS TIME

The SPEAKER - Mr O'Byrne, you have less than a minute left. You may bring another matter on or you may waive your additional time.

Mr O'BYRNE - With the indulgence of the House, I will waive my time.


CUSTODIAL INSPECTOR AMENDMENT (PROTECTION FROM REPRISAL) BILL 2025 (No. 9)

Second Reading

[2.35 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the bill be now read a second time.

Every member in this place, particularly the members who were involved in the Corrections portfolio, would be aware of the critical work the Custodial Inspector undertakes. On behalf of the Greens, to the Office of the Custodial Inspector, thank you for all your hard work and dedication.

Since the inception of the office in 2016, the Custodial Inspector has produced 10 inspection reports into youth custodial services, nine adult custodial services inspection reports, four reviews, a survey and a research paper. Each of these reports has been a considerable undertaking and resulted in numerous recommendations being made. The work has undoubtedly led to positive change. 
However, the government does not have a great track record when it comes to implementing these recommendations. In the latest annual report, the inspector notes that only 26 per cent of recommendations from the 2017 Care and Wellbeing Inspection Report of adult custodial services were completed or required no further action. For the 2017 health and wellbeing inspection of Ashley Youth Detention Centre, the number was somewhat higher but still only 37.5 per cent.

Tasmania's corrections system is in crisis. Overcrowding, excessive lockdowns, high levels of staff burnout, barriers to rehabilitation programs and tough-on-crime policies are driving up incarceration and recidivism and are all significant problems in our corrections system. The Custodial Inspector's work over many years lays out many things that can be done to improve the crises in our prisons. It is not only incumbent on the government to act on these recommendations, but we members of Parliament whose job it is to hold the government to account, must act as well.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.1_D=29.3_C=0.88] Through their significant body of work, the office of the inspector has done and continues to do the heavy lifting. From there, members have a responsibility to scrutinise the government to ensure that the custodial inspector's work is taken seriously and is acted upon. That responsibility is why, when the Custodial Inspector repeatedly made it clear that amendments to the Act were required, we listened. That, and the terrible stories coming out of our prisons that we hear all too often.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=58.8_D=5.8_C=0.76] That is why this bill is before the House today.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=65.3_D=25.8_C=0.90] The Custodial Inspector Act 2016 was enacted in 2016, almost a decade ago. Since the act's inception, it has only been amended twice via the Public Sector Superannuation Reform (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2016 and the Dangerous Criminals and High Risk Offenders Act 2021. Both acts made only minor consequential amendments.  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=91.6_D=4.0_C=0.66] In nine years of operation, the act has not had any substantive amendment.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=97.2_D=17.2_C=0.86] Section 26(2)(c) of the principal act requires that the Custodial Inspector's Annual Report contains any recommendations for changes in the laws of the state or for administrative action that the inspector considers should be made as the result of the performance of the inspector's functions.  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=115.0_D=20.0_C=0.80] In their 2020-21 Annual Report, the inspector first published recommendations under this section of the act. In the inspector's words: 

it has become evident that the legislative provisions for inspection reports result in a cumbersome and drawn out process which potentially risks compromising the Inspector's independence.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=135.7_D=30.0_C=0.87] The inspector recommended that the act be amended to allow for the Custodial Inspector to table their reports themselves rather than through the minister and that the time frames involved in the tabling be reduced. 

Clause 6 of our bill amends Section 15 of the principal act to provide that the Inspector is to table their own report rather than the minister. The clause also reduces the timeframe for tabling from not before 30 days after the report has been provided [Bookmark: Phr9_O=165.8_D=14.6_C=0.82]  to the minister, to not before seven days. 

At this stage, I flag that our bill missed a reference to a 30-day period in Section 15(6)(a) and we will be seeking to go into committee to move an amendment to remedy this omission.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=181.3_D=25.0_C=0.86] This proposed power to table their own reports is not unique. The national preventative mechanism (NPM) under Section 19(2) of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 has the power to table their own inspection reports. The Integrity Commission under Section 11(3) of the Integrity Commission Act 2009 can table a report on any matter arising in connection with the performance of its functions or exercise of its powers.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=207.2_D=4.7_C=0.85] The Ombudsman under Section 28(6) of the Ombudsman Act 1978  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=212.3_D=28.2_C=0.92] can table a report arising from an investigation themselves. Similarly, the Audit Office and the Commissioner for Children and Young People both have the authority to table their own reports of this nature. The only example we can find of an independent body that cannot table their own investigation reports is the Health Complaints Commission's special reports. 

The current requirement for the Custodial Inspector to go through the minister is very much the exception rather than the norm.  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=241.2_D=29.2_C=0.88] This recommendation has been reiterated in subsequent annual reports of the inspector. In 2022-23 this recommendation was joined by a range of others and first among these recommendations was a call for protections from reprisal. In the inspector's words:

Unfortunately, some people who have raised their concerns with my office have also reported that their actions in speaking with my office were sometimes not well received….  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=271.0_D=6.2_C=0.91] There are no protections for people who do come forward to report issues to my office. There should be.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=278.4_D=9.4_C=0.90] On August 5 last year, the Custodial Inspector issued a media release that again called for protections from reprisal in a media release that reiterated the need:

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=288.8_D=8.9_C=0.89] One of the main ways in which we hear about issues within custodial centres is when people, (including those in custody and staff) raise them with us.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=299.0_D=5.8_C=0.84] As well as repeating people's reports that it was not well received when they raised their concerns with the inspector, the Custodial Inspector went on to say:

Some people have also indicated that they are reluctant to disclose information knowing there is no protection against reprisal.

The inspector emphasised that there should be protections. We asked about this recommendation a number of times, including during Budget estimates, and the response from the government was:

We do not think that additional protections are necessary for staff and indeed the dry cells report which the custodial inspector issued not too long ago, stemmed from a staff member approaching the Custodial Inspector and making that reference, so I do not think that there is any need for it.

Staff are welcome to contact the custodial inspector and we welcome that as well. We try to act in a transparent manner and our staff are absolutely free to contact the custodial inspector. 

This is a wholly inadequate response. The TPS is a large organisation with new staff coming and going over the years. Reprisal could come from myriad positions, present or future. No organisation can guarantee that reprisals will not ever occur. The Custodial Inspector's comments have made it clear that some staff have felt that their actions were poorly received. Even if one were inclined to accept that reprisals are unlikely to occur, there is value in having protection spelled out solely to provide people with the confidence to come forward. It is also important to recognise that custodial settings are higher-risk settings for reprisal in general. Correctional institutions are environments that are inherently disciplinary in nature, with strong hierarchies and involve having significant power over others and the regular deployment of punitive measures.

The Custodial Inspector recommended provisions similar to those in section 36 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021. Clause 9 of our bill introduces protection from reprisal provisions consistent with this recommendation. The clause would introduce a new section 25A that prohibits a person from prejudicing or threatening to prejudice a person's safety or career, intimidating, harassing or threatening to intimidate or harass a person, take a detrimental action, or permitting another person to do any of the above to a person in response to that person providing information to the inspector. The penalty for a reprisal is up to 240 penalty units, or $48,480 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both.

In addition to section 36 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021, similar provisions can be found in section 19 of the Public Interest Disclosures Act 2002. Section 54(2) of the Integrity Commission Act 2009 also provides a broad protection against violence, punishment, damage, loss or disadvantage to another person for or on account of that other person having given evidence. In addition to provisions that provide protection from reprisal, the Custodial Inspector notes that section 35 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 provides considerable discretion in being able to share information that would assist in the work to improve conditions of people in places of detention.

Clause 10 of this bill amends section 34 of the principal act to extend protections for the provision of information on similar terms to section 35 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021. This clause extends the coverage to provision of information made for the purposes of the act, rather than just under the act, and extends to civil liability, as well as adding a qualifier that the protections only apply insofar as the information was provided in good faith. I note there is a spelling error in clause 10 and we have a small amendment to correct this error.

The 2022-23 annual report also noted that the information sharing powers of the Custodial Inspector are quite limited. Section 24(4) of the Custodial Inspector Act 2016 allows for information sharing with the Integrity Commission, Coroner, or Auditor-General and Section 30 allows information to be shared with the Ombudsman.

The Custodial Inspector notes there are no similar provisions allowing information to be shared with the Health Complaints Commissioner, Anti-Discrimination Commissioner and Commissioner for Children and Young People, for example. In contrast, section 22 of the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 allows information to be shared with and among other entities, public authorities and the responsible minister. Clause 8 of this bill introduces a new subsection (4A) to section 24 of the principal act, to allow information to be shared with public authorities and the responsible minister.

The custodial inspector also noted that current provisions of the act prevent the inspector from delegating powers to consultants. The practical concern is that it is necessary to acquire a gate pass in order for consultants to be granted access, which means that conducting an unannounced inspection without TPS being made aware of the inspection is not possible. The inspector recommended that changes be made that allow for them to delegate to consultants. Clauses 4 and 5 amend sections 4 and 10 of the principal act respectively to ensure that persons appointed for the purposes of carrying out an inspection can have powers delegated to them.

The final recommendation of the inspector that this bill addresses is a request for an amendment to section 17 to clarify that officers of the inspector also have the power to engage confidentially with prisoners or detainees.

The recommendations of the custodial inspector should not be controversial. Many of these amendments are small, practical changes that have become apparent over the nine years of the act's operation that would enable the act and the inspector to operate as they were always intended to. Other amendments, like protections from reprisal and the ability to directly table investigation reports, are the common standard with similar bodies and legislation, and will serve to improve the independence and effectiveness of the inspector as well as the safety of those who disclose information to the inspector. I commend the bill to the House.

[2.49 p.m.]
Ms BUTLER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, It is my pleasure to stand here today to debate the Custodial Inspector Amendment (Protection for Reprisal) Act 2024. We thank the member for Bass, Cecily Rosol, for bringing this bill to the House, and acknowledge that the bill covers the advice provided to the Minister for Corrections and Rehabilitation, Madeleine Ogilvie, within the Office of the Custodial Inspector Tasmania Annual Report 2022-23. I will read some of that report into the Hansard, because this is what has helped us with our decision to support or oppose this bill. On page 19 of the Office of the Custodial Inspector Tasmania Annual Report 2022-23, section 5.1: Protection from Reprisal, it reads:

I regularly hear about matters of concern in custodial centres from people working or housed there. Unfortunately, some people who have raised their concerns with my office have also reported that their actions in speaking with my office were sometimes not well received. Whilst I always strive to protect the identity of people who provide me with information, sometimes assumptions and conclusions can be drawn from circumstances. 

There are no protections for people who do come forward to report issues to my office. There should be.

This is reaffirmed on page 20, which states:

This can be a significant deterrent to reprisal action.

That is talking about the lack of protection for people wishing to give information.

People should be protected under the Custodial Inspector Act 2016 in similar terms to the OPCAT Implementation Act 2021 when they report matters of concern to my office. I would encourage parliament to consider bolstering protections for people who bring matters of concern to my office's attention. 

That was pretty clear. This was also related to us by the office when we had our briefing on this report and also the dry cells report, which was provided to the government as well. At that meeting the process for the tabling of those annual reports was also raised with us - that they had to go through the minister's office, and that the minister had 30 days to then table those reports to the House. It was seen as an inappropriate and maybe not a particularly logical or transparent process, and it was said that a seven-day process, and the inspector being able to table that themselves - or provide that report to the parliament themselves, and not having to go through the minister's office - would be a more prudent measure.

These are not new concepts at all. We know that Ms Rosol has asked these questions of the minister, both in Estimates and in Question Time, around the suggestions from the custodial inspector, and at both times it was suggested that, no, the government was not interested in implementing these changes. This is good work done by you, Ms Rosol. Thank you.

As we know, the custodial inspector is an independent statutory officer appointed by the Governor. When performing their duties, they must act independently, impartially and in the public interest, and that is the beauty of that role. The role is vital, especially in relation to work the custodial inspector undertakes within the implementation of the National Preventive Mechanisms (NPM) in Tasmania. Although this is underfunded and under-resourced by the government, we understand the need for having the proper mechanisms for the Office of the Custodial Inspector to adequately undertake this most important and extremely specialised and independent function. Transparency is key; access, specialised information gathering, reporting and accountability to ensure human rights abuses, and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, cannot occur within our correctional facilities.

We acknowledge the correspondence as well as more supporting evidence dated 5 August 2024 which is pertinent to this bill. This is a media release from the Office of the Custodial Inspector Tasmania and it states:

"One of the main ways in which we hear about issues within custodial centres is when people (including those in custody and staff) raise them with us," he said [the inspector]. "Some people who have raised concerns with my office in the past have reported that their actions were not well received -

This is reaffirming the annual report -

- either by other custodial staff or by other people in custody. Some people have also indicated that they are reluctant to disclose information knowing there is no protection against reprisal. 

…

"While people can contact us anonymously, unfortunately there are no protections in the Custodial Inspector Act 2016 against reprisal targeting those who have spoken with my Office. There should be.

"Although we strive to protect the identity of people who provide us with information, sometimes assumptions and conclusions can be drawn from the circumstances being reviewed and reported on.

The Custodial Inspector is required to make recommendations for legislative change that they consider should be made pertaining to the performance of their functions.

He then goes on to state:

"We highlighted this issue, among others, in our 2022-2023 Annual Report but have not yet received any indication from the Minister for Corrections and Rehabilitation that this legislative defect will be addressed," Mr Connock said.

The inspector is referring to it as a 'legislative defect'. 

"We encourage Minister Ogilvie and Parliament to address this issue in the interests of improving the welfare of people in custody."

Therefore, based on the information that has been provided by the inspector and that we have received from the appropriate unions, we have no reason to believe that the amendments put forward in this bill by Ms Rosol would be detrimental at all. They can only do good. I do not think they can do more harm than good.

There is one question I wanted to ask, and that was about powers of delegation. Just to clarify, is it the inspector that has the power to delegate? That was my understanding of the legislation, but there was some wording in your speech that made it sound as though it could be delegated from another authority - if you could clarify that for the record.

We support this bill and again, we thank the member for bringing this forward.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=7.4_D=2.2_C=0.63]  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=15.1_D=1.8_C=0.60] Ms OGILVIE (Clark - Minister for Corrections and Rehabilitation) -  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=18.0_D=27.7_C=0.83] Honourable Speaker, I rise to speak on the private members' bill introduced by member for the Greens, Cecily Rosol. The Custodial Inspector Amendment (Protection from Reprisal) Bill 2025 seeks to amend the Custodial Inspector Act 2016. It proposes protections for whistleblowers against reprisal. It extends the Custodial Inspector's delegation powers and adjusts the process for tabling reports in this House.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=46.5_D=6.3_C=0.76] I value the opportunity to openly discuss our correction system. However, it is the position of our government that this bill is unnecessary because it adds regulation to a system that is already effective and well supported. 

Correctional officers and frontline workers are the foundation of our custodial framework and their service is exceptional. I speak to their service every time I am able to.  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=78.3_D=6.0_C=0.74] They perform demanding roles with professionalism, and manage complex environments with dedication  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=84.6_D=30.0_C=0.88] and skill. I take great pride in the work they are doing, that we are doing, and the investments we are making to support them. 

The Custodial Inspector is a vital partner in these efforts and their contribution is highly regarded. This parliament has been informed of our ongoing commitment to improving custodial standards. We have adopted 511 recommendations from the inspector in recent years. Only 34 have not been implemented, reflecting focus on progress in those statements. 

The voices of our officers and frontline workers are essential to this, not just as elements in political debate. When they raise concerns, we listen carefully and we respond with action. This underscores the strength of  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=145.0_D=6.2_C=0.88] our collaborative approach. It is important to work together as a team.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=152.5_D=25.2_C=0.83] This bill assumes additional measures are required to encourage openness amongst our staff. Our position is that current protections are sufficient and practical. Section 34 of the Custodial Inspector Act 2016 ensures safety for those who provide information while the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2022 offers a clear framework to staff to report misconduct. These provisions are designed to safeguard without creating complexity. Introducing further measures risks unnecessary overlap and it addresses a need that our existing system already meets.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=178.5_D=1.8_C=0.86]  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=195.3_D=25.2_C=0.83] I support governance that prioritises efficiency over excessive regulation. We rely on systems that deliver results, not those that burden progress. The Greens often propose increased oversight and additional layers. However, our preference is for outcomes achieved through cooperation and trust. This House is aware of our substantial investments in custodial care.  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=221.4_D=3.8_C=0.72] Our correctional officers and frontline workers contribute actively  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=225.5_D=17.3_C=0.77] and their perspectives shape our decisions. Additional regulations are not needed to sustain their engagement. The disclosures act is already comprehensive and detailed. Our current approach effectively supports staff without further complexity.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=243.6_D=23.6_C=0.85] I recognise the correctional officers and frontline workers who uphold our systems. Their roles are critical to public safety as they manage individuals in challenging settings with expertise and genuine care. It is rigorous, often unseen work, and I deeply respect their efforts. I convey this to them when I meet with them.  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=268.6_D=4.1_C=0.74] Their insights inform our policies, from daily operations to long-term improvements.  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=273.6_D=14.4_C=0.78] We listen. Their contributions must remain a driving force, not a point of political contention. This bill is well-meaning and adds layers to a system that already empowers their voices.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=289.0_D=14.6_C=0.84] On the bill specifics, its delegation provisions are broad in scope. The intent to facilitate the Custodial Inspector's inspection processes is noted. However, this government approaches such matters with practicality. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=304.4_D=0.5_C=0.76]  Regarding the tabling of reports, the existing process fosters shared accountability, which is important. Assigning this solely to the Custodial Inspector within seven days reduces that partnership. A 30-day period supports thoughtful responses and meaningful advancements, and gives time to contemplate solutions.

I am dedicated to accountability that produces practical outcomes. Our correctional officers and frontline workers undertake a vital role and their efforts deserve continued recognition. I engage with the Custodial Inspector and senior prison service officials, and this ongoing dialogue serves its purpose well.

This House is familiar with the work we are undertaking and the resources we are committing and continue to commit, and these efforts stem from collaboration, not from adjusting established processes. The Greens seek to extend discussion over measures that offer limited additional value. We focus on steady progress guided by sound principles of continuous improvement. Our government is committed to foundational improvements that strengthen our correctional system. The efforts of our officers and frontline workers are central to that progress. 

The Department of Justice is working with others to explore in-cell technology, leveraging expertise to enhance rehabilitation, education and family connections tailored to Tasmania's needs. We are also investing in practical upgrades like the new kitchen build at the prison, which is amazing and coming on remarkably, and which supports rehabilitation by equipping prisoners with skills for life beyond custody and, undoubtedly, will improve the life of people who wish to work in the kitchen.

Consider the broader context: our correctional system is advancing because of the people who sustain it. Our officers and frontline workers identify issues, the Custodial Inspector investigates and we implement solutions. We work together to do that as a team.

Our investments, modernising facility and improving systems, reflects significant funding to support this foundation. Legislation is not required to demonstrate our commitment. You hear about it whenever I have the opportunity to speak about what we are doing in this sector in this place. 

The voices of our officers and frontline workers are integral. I talk about people. It is all about people. They guide our direction. Their role must remain central, not be overshadowed by political debate. It is too important.

Addressing the bill further, our existing provisions meet the needs it targets. The disclosures act provides a thorough framework for whistleblower protection. Section 34 reinforces this concisely. When staff come forward, they are supported and their input informs our actions. This system functions well, as evidenced by our responsive approach.

I urge this House to focus on the strengths we have built - partnerships, collaboration, working together to ensure the system works as well as we can make it. Our correctional officers and frontline workers deserve a system that values their service, not one encumbered by unneeded rules. I call on members to support the mechanisms already in place. As I have spoken third in the line-up today, I recognise that the numbers, particularly in relation to Labor's contribution, mean that, in this minority parliament, we may be going into committee and further debating this bill. We do not support the bill for the reasons I have stated, because we are fostering a correctional system of integrity through partnership with officers, frontline workers, the inspector and this government. The Greens see more laws as the answer. I believe this is a genuine attempt to improve a problem they suspect they have uncovered, but we see the dedication of our people as the key. I want to make sure their voices remain a force for progress.

I also ask the proponents to reconsider the very name of the bill. It seems to me that the title in itself is somewhat prejudicial as it makes an assumption regarding potential matters as being reprisal in nature, and that is indeed something only a court of law can determine by way of what intent may or may not have been attached to a certain set of circumstances. I would ask you to consider whether you could have a more neutral name to your bill.

Again, I note that the welfare of the people we have in custody is at the core of the work we do as a corrections process and in our facilities. We cannot do that without collaboration, both within the service, government, and across our inspectorates as well. That is something that is deeply important to us.

I see that the clock is ticking away. I suspect there may be more speakers, although I am not catching anybody's eye; possibly not, so we will wrap up at that point. Thank you very much.

[3.08 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, it is a great pleasure to be here in the Chamber today to take some actions in response to some long-held concerns from our independent statutory officer, the Custodial Inspector. I reiterate what the member for Bass, Cecily Rosol, who is taking carriage of this bill for the Greens today, has said about the Custodial Inspector. The work that he does is incredibly important, incredibly underfunded relative to the gravity of his role, and a huge plethora of duties that he is responsible for that is manifestly on the public record and has been stated by many people other than and including the Greens. The Custodial Inspector's work is critical.

Minister, I personally could not make any sense of your arguments because you did not address any of the reasons that Ms Rosol gave for why this bill is coming today. I believe it is a little bit rich talking as though it is inappropriate to use the term 'reprisals' when that is the reason that we are here today; because the independent statutory authority, the Custodial Inspector, has used that term himself. That is why we are here today. It is obviously the appropriate term and I hope that the minister will respect the advice and the information that has been provided by the custodial inspector because he is the one, who parliament has tasked with doing these independent inspections. 

Ms Ogilvie made the comment, 'The Greens see more laws as the answer,' as though there is something wrong with more laws. Here we are in the Parliament of Tasmania and, in case students who are leaving do not know, we are here to make laws. That is our job: to make laws. If the government is going to stop making laws, well, that is going to be a very interesting change of precedent in the Westminster system because we have only four bills that are listed, I believe. That is not a lot happening, from the government's point of view, but there you go, I guess they are not making laws anymore. The Greens will be making laws. It is not even a new act.

We are amending an act and we are making it better from information that was provided by the independent statutory authority, the custodial inspector - a person who has been stoically representing people who do not have a voice and speaking on their behalf and making those same comments for years now.

For the benefit of anyone who is watching, and particularly for Ms Ogilvie, I would like to go through what our recent history was when we had a Greens correction minister 11 years ago now, and reflect on the changes that we have seen over the past 11 years under this Liberal government's approach to corrections, to rehabilitation and to managing crime in the community. 
What happened under minister Nick McKim at the time, who had the Corrections portfolio, was a dramatic reversal in the culture for the Risdon Prison complex in particular. He went through a huge cultural change process which was not without its controversy and not without its difficulty. At the end of four years, what that resulted in was a demonstrated dramatic reversal in crimes in prison  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.6_D=25.2_C=0.86] and recidivism, and those two measures are the most critical for anyone who ought to be concerned about how prisons get managed in Tasmania because recidivism, the number of times that people who leave prison are returned to prison because they create a crime, is a direct indication of how effective prisons are in rehabilitating and undertaking restorative justice. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=56.5_D=3.9_C=0.82]  

What we saw under a Greens Corrections minister in the Labor-Greens government  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=61.4_D=29.3_C=0.86] was a big a reduction in recidivism and what we have seen in the 11 years since the Liberals have been in government is a huge increase in recidivism. In other words, people are leaving prison and many more times than they were under a Greens Corrections minister, they are returning to prison not because it is a holiday house, but because they have created a crime. That demonstrates a failure of the system under the Liberals  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=90.9_D=29.3_C=0.87] to put in place the programs that inmates need while they are in prison and when they leave prison, to make sure that they have every opportunity, every ability, to not return to a life of crime. 

One of the first things that the Liberals did when they came to government, I think it was in 2015 or 2016, is they took away the funding from the RIO program, the reintegration  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=120.5_D=3.9_C=0.72] of ex-offenders program which was  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=126.4_D=1.5_C=0.76]  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=129.8_D=16.1_C=0.82] an incredibly successful program. It only cost $260 million a year. They quantified that it saved $1 million a year and what it did was it helped people - 

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=147.6_D=14.3_C=0.84] Mr Bayley - $260,000 a year?

Dr WOODRUFF - $260,000 a year and it saved $1 million a year. More to the point, by the time the program has been running for a couple of years, they had zero per cent reoffending from people who went through that program and that is [Bookmark: Phr10_O=162.3_D=29.0_C=0.87]  outstanding. The reason it worked was because there was money put into helping people when they left prison to get them jobs, reintegrate with their family, get involved in the community, in volunteering, have housing and have the sorts of things that people need to help them to break the patterns of crime and make sure that they do not repeat crimes and go back into prison. 

The other thing that we have seen  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=191.7_D=12.8_C=0.83] in the 11 years that the Liberals have been in government is a reversal of the trends that occurred downwards under a Greens minister in the Labor-Greens government, of assaults in prisons.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=204.8_D=29.8_C=0.85] Assaults in prisons were very high and what we saw was a sharp decline, after the cultural change in the prisons, of assaults from staff to prisoners, from prisoners to staff and from prisoners to prisoners. All of those were going down. Ever since the Liberals have been in government with a pause of a couple of years - Vanessa Goodwin was an excellent Corrections minister - those numbers have been going up. They have been going up and up  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=234.7_D=26.2_C=0.85] every year. The prison is a more dangerous place. It is a more dangerous place for inmates and it is a more dangerous place for staff. Custodial officers are exposed to a more dangerous place, as are prisoners, than they were 11 years ago under this Liberal government's mismanagement, their approach and underfunding of the prisons. 

The other thing that has gone away year-on-year has been [Bookmark: Phr14_O=261.8_D=3.7_C=0.68]  support for people to be involved in therapeutic programs to deal with drug addiction and people go into prison so often because of addiction to drugs and stealing and other minor crimes or maybe not-so-minor crimes that are a result in part because of an addiction to drugs.  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=265.9_D=26.5_C=0.83] This is the sort of work that was being funded and prisoners were being helped to get off  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=293.2_D=1.6_C=0.90] the harmful use of drugs. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=295.3_D=9.6_C=0.86]  The funding for that has gone down, as has the funding for literacy programs. 

Another incredibly important part of a person leaving prison and changing their life is to have access to an education program in the prison and specifically hands-on person-to-person, adult-specific literacy education that is personalised to each person, is a highly skilled, very important part of what used to be offered for people in prisons and now if it is there, it is certainly not being offered to the same quality that it was - no disrespect at all for the people who are working to do that work, it is just that they should have a lot more support, minister, because I know that they are doing it very tough, doing the best that they can with a tiny amount of money that is available to do that really important work.

The point I want to make is that overcrowding in prisons has gone up steeply under the Liberals. I do not have the figures to hand. Perhaps the minister could tell us if she had that information available to her, perhaps if we go into committee, what the numbers are of people in the Risdon Prison complex at the moment, because I certainly remember in 2015, when I was the Corrections - 

Ms Ogilvie - It is all in Estimates. I gave it to you.

The SPEAKER - First, the minister will not interject, and second, the questions in committee will go to the member who has moved the bill and not the minister.

Dr WOODRUFF - Thank you, Honourable Speaker. I remember, when I was the corrections shadow before Ms Rosol, that the figures that we had at the time were 470 people in RPC. A couple of years later they went up to 550 people. I remember hearing that they were well over that, well north of that, the last time I heard, but whatever the number is today, we can be very confident that our prisons in Tasmania over a decade of the Liberals' 'tough on crime' approach and coupled with an under-resourcing of the prison system, rehabilitation and restorative justice has meant that our prisons are bursting at the seams and that obviously has a huge impact on the wellbeing and the care of inmates and it obviously has huge impact on the staff.

The other thing that went down under the Greens minister from 2010 to 2014 was the amount of sick leave and stress leave that staff were taking in the prisons. Again, that has skyrocketed under the Liberals and is another bit of information that is relevant to this bill. These are the circumstances that the Custodial Inspector is experiencing when he goes into the prison to do an inspection and what he is there to do, of course, is to look at the standards, to look at the specific wellbeing, the care, the rehabilitation and the safety of prisoners and also to hear the stories of staff. In this context, we believe the Custodial Inspector when he says that there needs to be protections against reprisals for people who want to speak to him because there is no doubt, with the evidence he has provided, that people have felt a chilling effect in being able to speak up.

The minister said earlier that she would prefer not to legislate on these matters, but she would prefer to work with cooperation and trust. I say, how about you work with listening and believing? That would be a really good start. Do not tell people to have trust in you. You have to earn trust and the evidence from the custodial inspector is that the Liberals have not earned the trust of the people in prisons, who are the custodial staff or the inmates, because they are his words. They feel that they need protections in order to be able to speak freely.

This bill is a very important contribution to Tasmania's whistleblower protection laws. It will provide the safeguards for people who want to speak freely and who want to speak to a person who has not been given a sanitised prison space to go into. Another very important part of this bill, a small part of this bill, is it will enable the custodial inspector to make unannounced inspections without having everything tidied away and organised. He should be able to, in his role, see for himself the circumstances that people are incarcerated in. He should be able to see how many staff are on for the day. He should be able to understand what their experiences are, reflect on that and provide an informed report.

On behalf of the Greens, I want to thank Labor for their support. I am not surprised, and I am pleased to hear, that Labor is supporting this legislation. We believe it will make a real and sustained difference to people who are living in or working in our prisons. We certainly hope that the work of the custodial inspector and what he brings to light in his reports will in some way encourage or direct - whatever is required - the government to put more funding into restorative justice and rehabilitation. 

It is not just good for the welfare of people who are housed and who call those places their home while they are incarcerated there, it is good for the community to have lower rates of reoffending when people leave prison. It is also better for inmates' families, because they will go back into the community with better literacy, with a better ability to manage drug use, and with more potential to be able to get a job and be reincorporated into the community.

[3.24 p.m.]
Mr BEHRAKIS (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to address the Greens' private members bill, the Custodial Inspector Amendment (Protection from Reprisal) Bill 2025. As I understand it, the bill seeks to amend the Custodial Inspector Act 2016 by introducing protections for whistleblowers and expanding the inspector's delegation powers, altering the process of tabling bills in this House. I think it is important, as we discuss this today, to appreciate the intent with which this bill has been introduced and debated in this place. While we welcome any open discussion about our corrections system, we consider this bill to be unnecessary. It imposes additional regulation on a framework that already has robust and effective protections in this space.

Our corrections officers and frontline workers are the cornerstone of our system. They protect those in our prison system and they undertake very challenging roles. They manage complex environments with exceptional skill. We have invested in and continue to invest significantly in modern facilities and improved processes.

Over the term of government, we have adopted 511 recommendations from the custodial inspector in recent years. Only 34 of those remain outstanding. It is a clear demonstration of our commitment to progress in this space. When these workers speak, we listen, carefully and deliberately, and we respond with actions. I note something that was said earlier: that one of the main roles of the parliament is to pass laws. Yes, but that does not mean that we should pass any and all ideas that come through this place. We need to be careful not to fall into that old adage of being a hammer to everything that looks like a nail.

The Greens assert that further measures are needed to protect whistleblowers and encourage openness. Existing safeguards are both sufficient and practical. For instance, section 34 of the Custodial Inspector Act 2016 ensures protection for those who come forward. The Public Interest Disclosures Act 2022 provides a comprehensive framework for reporting misconduct. These provisions are straightforward and these provisions are effective, supporting staff without adding unnecessary complexity.

This bill -  and I reiterate, it is well intentioned -  introduces overlap that addresses no real gap. It risks burdening a system that is already meeting those objectives. This government prioritises governance that does not deliver over-excessive regulation. The Greens, we know, often advocate for additional oversight, layers of control and additional regulations. Our approach is grounded in collaboration and trust - trusting those workers who are the ones who are at the coalface of sustaining our corrections system. Their perspectives are the ones that shape our decisions daily, from operational refinements to long-term improvements. We do not require more legislation to affirm their value or amplify their roles.

On the specifics of the bill, the proposed delegation powers are overly broad and lack precision. The intent to streamline the inspector's work is noted, but  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=12.9_D=5.7_C=0.68] what is being proposed is not practical. Similarly, the shift to tabling a report within seven days solely by the inspector undermines  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=20.3_D=2.2_C=0.56] the process of shared accountability that we currently have.  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=23.8_D=5.4_C=0.74] We need a measured timeline that allows us to account for and consider responses and meaningful progress.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=30.8_D=25.8_C=0.73] We are committed to accountability that produces outcomes, not additional and unnecessary bureaucracy. Our correctional officers and frontline workers perform and continue to perform a vital role in upholding public safety, and their efforts merit recognition. We engage regularly with the Custodial Inspector and senior prison service officials, and this dialogue effectively serves its purpose.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=57.2_D=2.9_C=0.65] Our investments and actions reflect the partnership of those on the ground, not a need for  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=60.7_D=27.1_C=0.70] procedural tweaks. The Greens may see value in extending this debate, but we see value in steady, principled advancement. We need to consider the broader picture. Our correctional system is improving because of those who drive it. Our officers and frontline staff identify issues, the inspector investigates those issues and we implement solutions. This is not just a theoretical exercise; it is the functioning reality. It is what we see on the ground and it is supported by  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=88.7_D=7.1_C=0.64] very substantial resources. 

The voices of our workers are not sidelined by any means. They are an integral part of our direction,  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=97.0_D=3.9_C=0.71] and it goes to show that legislation is not required to improve our commitment here.  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=102.0_D=2.2_C=0.79] That commitment is evident in the results that we see. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=106.1_D=13.4_C=0.80]  I urge this House to focus on the strengths that have been established. Our correctional officers and frontline workers deserve a system that honours their service, not one weighed down by redundant rules and regulations.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=120.2_D=25.5_C=0.71] The existing mechanisms - section 34 of the Custodial Inspector Act, and the Public Interest Disclosures Act - provide the necessary protections and pathways. When staff raise concerns, they are heard and supported, and those concerns are acted on. This is a system of integrity - building collaboration between workers, the inspector and the government. The Greens, as usual, may view more laws as the solution. We instead see a dedication to working with our people as the foundation.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=146.8_D=16.3_C=0.62] Having spoken to the minister's staff, I think there was a question around the number of people within the prison system. The update I was given was that as of today, 755 are in the prison system, which is about 10 per cent down from our peak of 826.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=165.2_D=4.3_C=0.62] I know there was also some mention of the Greens' record in this space, and I think it does  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=171.0_D=14.9_C=0.76] bear looking back on that for the benefit of the Hansard, such as when then minister McKim closed Hayes Prison Farm, which led to reduced transitional benefits to prisoners and an increase in recidivism. Just going through  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=187.2_D=5.4_C=0.85] news articles from 2011, let us talk about reprisals,  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=195.0_D=13.3_C=0.61] when the then Tasmanian corrections minister Nick McKim defended his decision to stand down guards at Risdon Prison because of an industrial dispute which saw 15 correction officers stood down for refusing to carry out certain duties. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=209.6_D=17.9_C=0.74]  Then minister McKim said:

While people are refusing to carry out and obey lawful and reasonable instruction from prison management, it is very difficult or impossible to run a prison properly. We have made our decision and are urging those correctional officers who have implemented industrial action to reconsider their decision. Come back to work and we will be happy to have you back.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=229.7_D=26.8_C=0.67] He said:

It is unacceptable for staff and unions to simply stop performing their normal duties in this wildcat and unauthorised manner, especially considering that this follows a period of significant genuine consultation about the issues of concerns. 

This was then responded to by the Public Sector Union at the time as the most draconian thing an employer could do. I know we are talking about  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=257.3_D=4.4_C=0.59] protections against reprisals. Let us talk about the Greens'  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=262.4_D=22.0_C=0.87] record and history in this space. I think that history speaks for itself.

In the meantime, the government do not believe this is necessary. We do not believe it will fix any problems that existing mechanisms are not already addressing. Whilst I do appreciate the  [Bookmark: Phr22_O=286.0_D=7.9_C=0.81] intent with which this is being put, I think there are better ways to tackle this issue and that comes from collaborating [Bookmark: Phr23_O=294.7_D=10.3_C=0.76]  with the inspector and with those who are at the frontline of the coalface of this system. I believe that is the way to address these issues, not by what is being proposed today.

[3.32 p.m.]
Mr ELLIS (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this bill. I understand the minister has already made some important remarks. I am certainly listening to the member for Clark, Mr Behrakis. I would concur with his summary of the Greens' hypocrisy on this matter in particular. We know that they have an atrocious record when it comes to the management of our prisons, including closing the prison farm, and a record of decisions that is frankly disgraceful.

A lot of the changes we have made in government to increase transparency and accountability over the last 10 years, the investments that we made, are all investments that you could have made when you were in government, including as the relevant ministers, but you chose not to. You were too busy shutting down the forest industry and chucking thousands of people out of work to make the kind of investments you now apparently claim to be big supporters of.

Mr Bayley - That was 10 years ago. Can you get to the substance of this thing, or what?

Dr Woodruff - Such a pathetic argument.

The SPEAKER - We might stick to the matter before the House.

Mr ELLIS - I believe it is important because, while we are talking about the importance of these things, actions speak louder than words, and when you had your time in government you chose not to act -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members from the Greens, you will stop responding to the deliberate baiting by the minister. The minister will return to the subject matter at hand.

Mr ELLIS - Can I take offence to your comments?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - And the member for Lyons. The House will come to order. Come on, let us get this bill done, please.

Mr ELLIS - Thank you, Speaker. I appreciate your ruling. I will tackle the Greens' grand claims on this matter while they peddle this Custodial Inspector amendment bill. Let us talk about the facts when it comes to what is happening with our prisons. In the 2024-25 Budget we laid out a very clear plan: millions for rehabilitation, infrastructure, staff support, real investment; not just words, not just the kind of hollow rhetoric that is backed up with nothing, as we have previously seen from the Greens.

This is a government that is tough on crime and strong on rehabilitation. We want to be tough on the causes of crime. We know that crime can beget more crime, but we also know that with the investments we are making we can make a difference when it comes to recidivism.

Take the $4 million over four years for treatment -

Ms ROSOL - Point of order, Speaker. This is a very specific bill on the Custodial Inspector Act. We have limited time for debate and we are now veering off into other areas, so point of order, Standing Order 45, relevance.

The SPEAKER - It is not 45, 45 applies only to Question Time, but there is a relevance for prescribed content of speeches, which is 142. Would you like to raise 142 as that would be more appropriate?

Ms ROSOL - Yes, thank you.

The SPEAKER - I will not be giving guidance on Standing Orders all the time but, minister, I will draw you to Standing Order 142.

Mr ELLIS - As I mentioned, we are investing significant money: $4 million over four years for treatment programs, helping offenders and those at risk of sexual offending with counselling that stops trouble before it starts. That is important. The $15.9 million for the Risdon Prison upgrades: new kitchen, better rehab spaces, and tech to give prisoners a leg-up; that is a success. That is building a system that cuts recidivism, keeps communities safe, and provides better facilities.

With my skills and training hat on, talking about our involvement through the prisons: we want to use that as an opportunity to upskill people, to provide them with more knowledge and opportunities than when they went in. Those are the kinds of investments, again, that if you were serious last time you were in government, you could have made, but you did not. You were too busy closing the prison farm, which was great for rehabilitation. You were too busy destroying our economy to invest in essential services like prisons. If you can feel the frustration from the hypocrisy you are bringing into this place, it is genuine because you do not seem to like having your own record read back to you. We talked about the closure of the prison farm, a place that gave prisoners skills and purpose. 

We are too busy fixing things to go too far into the old missteps, but we have added $1 million a year for home detention and electronic monitoring. This has been important when it comes to ensuring we are keeping the community safe, but also we have an appropriate setting for those particular offenders. Tasmania has been a nation leader when it comes to this. We are looking for opportunities to make those kind of investments so we can deliver a system that backs rehabilitation while keeping the community safe. That is the balance our community expects. They do not want the Greens' approach of treating the perpetrators as though they are victims. They want a balanced approach that provides for the rehabilitation required, but the protection of the community comes first.

The staff at the heart of our system are amazing people. They do amazing things in challenging circumstances. These are very challenging people to work with, but the opportunity to turn lives around, you see it in their eyes when you meet these people. They have a strong commitment to public service, to working with some of the most challenging people you will see in terms of public service and trying to make a difference.

There is $3.5 million annually to support injured officers who go to work and, at times, face physically or mentally challenging environments. We pay tribute to their incredible work. We want to support people to continue to upskill, do the right thing and be supported to carry out the important mission of the Tasmanian Prison Service. There is an additional $800,000 for wellbeing programs because we know that if we are making those investments at the front end, we can better support people to continue to be healthy and well while they undertake this important calling. The Greens want more rules, more oversights, but where is the strategy?

Ms ROSOL - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 151, continued irrelevance and tedious repetition. What the minister is saying has nothing to do with the legislation being debated at the moment. 

The SPEAKER - I draw the member to the content before the speech. Some of the matters he has addressed have been raised in other people's contributions, but I will call the minister to that.

Mr ELLIS - I acknowledge our friends in local government and their passion for corrections, and the interesting debates that happen in our communities. 

The Greens are not looking at the big picture when it comes to this. They are just fishing for votes with a tired narrative. There is an irony that this bill contains an increase in penalties, which I did not think I would see coming from the Greens. It seems they are happy to increase penalties when it suits them, but when it comes to protecting vulnerable members of our community on the streets, they seem to oppose that kind of stuff.

Dr Woodruff - We took this legislation from your own bill, minister.

The SPEAKER - The Leader of the Greens may take points of order, but interjections are not okay.

Mr ELLIS - That will be a matter for them to work out, but the inconsistency and hypocrisy is noted. We are delivering results, we are delivering safer streets, stronger rehabilitation and backing our prison officers to succeed in their vital work. 

Regarding delegation, I understand this introduces a power to delegate to a person appointed by the inspector. There is only one relevant power of appointment in the Custodial Inspector Act, which is under section 11 of the act, to make appointments under the State Service Act. The State Service Act power of appointment does not extend to contracts for consultants. Therefore, this amendment does not serve the purpose the member's second reading speech indicates it is designed for. That seems to be a fundamental error of either drafting or policy - certainly of approach.

In practice, officers or employees of the inspector are made available to the inspector by the Department of Justice under section 11(2). These persons can already receive delegations. When we talk about the duplicative and unnecessary nature of this amendment, that is one of the things we are talking about. The amendment is unnecessary. It can be addressed through prescribing any necessary persons in regulation, if it becomes necessary or appropriate.

However, if the amendment is intended to extend to contractors and consultants which, given some of our other conversations - and I mentioned the Greens' hypocrisy and inconsistency before - it would be very unusual to allow delegation of statutory powers to contractors or consultants. It is more appropriate that contractors and consultants assist the inspector and the inspector's delegated officers and employees. I am not sure if that was the intention of the legislation. I am not getting much in response there. I am sure you will address it during the committee stage. I am not sure if that is what you were aiming to achieve or an unintended consequence. You might just have a disagreement, or it might be a drafting error. I understand you are going to potentially move amendments to your own bill, so that might come up later in the debate.

The act already gives the inspector and delegates powers under section 8(h) to:

Do all things necessary or convenient to be done in connection with the performance and exercise of his or her functions and powers under this Act.

This includes bringing consultants with them to assist the inspector. For those reasons, the government does not support those amendments.

There is a matter about the inspection report. By convention, there is a mix of practice as to whether independent statutory officers provide their reports to the responsible minister. For example, the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner provides reports to the minister for tabling. In such provisions, the minister has no power to edit or withhold the report, and must lay a report on the table within the specified timeframe as soon as practicable after 30 calendar days. The 30-day timeframe is to ensure that the responsible minister can inquire into matters raised and be advised by the department of issues such as which recommendations to accept. It is important to work through those matters and be able to brief the parliament when the report is tabled. 

I am not sure if the intention is to take away the ability for the minister to do such things. If you were to ever go back into government as part of a Labor-Greens government,  you might be the Corrections minister. Perhaps you might want to be able to consider such things. It would send a shiver down the spine of most right-thinking Tasmanians that you would be in such a position, but if it were to happen again as part of a dodgy deal, you should at least know what you might be getting yourselves into.

In terms of the matter relating to the inspector's access to prisons and detainees, the inspector can be provided both officers and employees. These persons can already receive delegations of the inspector's functions. We have spoken about unnecessary duplication and red tape. It seems as though you just wanted to bring forward a bill that has something to do with the prisons, but doing so in this manner is clunky, unnecessary and we believe better paths already exist to do these things. These persons can already receive delegations of the inspector's functions. References to 'inspector' in the act include delegates of the inspector. The amendment is, therefore, unnecessary. It also might imply that employees of the inspector who hold delegations do not have the access 'officers' do. It also means that officers of the inspector would have total access to any prisoner even if they had not been delegated that task by the inspector. It is more appropriate for the act to remain as is, which allows both the inspector and delegates to have access to prisoners.

The amendments might also imply that other references to 'inspector' in the act do not include delegates, which would hamper the operation of the inspectorate. It probably should have been something that you considered when you put together this half-baked amendment. You are not just changing this part of the act; it could have broader ramifications across the whole act. That is one of the challenges when you are a minor party. You do not do consultation on legislation, and really these things are for show rather than for substance. 

These are the laws of Tasmania. If you are going to bring things forward you should do people the service of consulting properly because then, agree or disagree -

Dr Woodruff - You are pretty scared of this bill. You are scared of it.

The SPEAKER - Members of the Greens, thank you.

Mr ELLIS - you might get a better product out of it, rather than doing a half-baked and incomplete job that duplicates, is in many ways unnecessary, and might have unintended consequences that could have a negative effect on one of the most important core services of government, which is Corrections.

A member - Three minutes and 35 seconds to go.

The SPEAKER - The member for Lyons is on warnings already.

Mr ELLIS - I missed that, member for Lyons.

A member - I was just calling out the time.

The SPEAKER - That is alright. The minister can continue his contribution without engaging in cross-Chamber chat.

Mr ELLIS - Thank you, Speaker. Regarding the disclosure of information - again, I stress this amendment is both completely unnecessary and strangely broad. Under section 24(2), the inspector and the officers can already disclose information in the performance of functions, which would include disclosure to the responsible minister and to relevant bodies, including public bodies when relevant to the inspector's functions.

The Greens' amendment provides an unconditional exemption for the inspector or officers to disclose to any 'public authority'. For example, there is no requirement the disclosure is for the functions of the inspector. The Custodial Inspector Act 2016 defines 'public authority' by reference to the Ombudsman Act 1978. That act has a very broad range of bodies under that definition. Why would we support an amendment that suggests that the inspector or officers should be unconditionally disclosing matters to, for example, government business enterprises, state-owned companies, water and sewerage entities, and so on.

The existing bill's disclosure provisions are fit for purpose; the new amendments are not. Just as an aside, the definition of 'public authority' in the Ombudsman Act 1978 includes: a state service agency; the police service; a local authority; a body or authority, whether incorporated or not, that is constituted or established by or under an act for a public purpose; a body or authority, whether incorporated or not, whose members or a majority of whose members are appointed by the governor or a minister; government business enterprises; a state-owned company; for some reason you want to be providing that information to the University of Tasmania - I did not think you guys liked each other all that much anymore these days, but that is another matter; or a regulated entity within the meaning of the Water and Sewerage Industry Act 2008.

This is a sloppy piece of work. It is unnecessary; it is unclear; it is potentially full of unintended consequences. It would not be a Greens' bill if it did not smack of hypocrisy and inconsistency, and finding any way to try and get political leverage from an important area that the government has already done the work in - work that you refused to do when you last had a chance in government.

We are not going to take the carping and whingeing from the Greens. We are working through improving the prisons in a methodical way. We have increased integrity in government. We have increased disclosure far and above what the Greens ever did in the sorry and sad days of a Labor-Greens minority government. If you want to see real action on improving the prison system, being tough on crime and strong on rehabilitation, look towards what this government is doing. Get on board rather than getting in the way.

[3.52 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, in a previous life, I was in and out of jail - I hasten to add, in a professional capacity.  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.2_D=5.0_C=0.77] I have nothing but the highest regard for our prison officers. They do an excellent job in exceptionally difficult circumstances. I also recall visiting the Hayes Prison Farm on a relatively regular basis, and seeing the wonderful -

Ms ROSOL - Point of order, Speaker, this is about the Custodial Inspector Amendment Bill, not about things that happened in the past and not about prisoners. This is about the Custodial Inspector and protecting people.

The SPEAKER - Thank you. Member, can you tell me what your Standing Order is?

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=64.5_D=19.8_C=0.85] Ms ROSOL - It is 142.

The SPEAKER - That order is about the content of speeches. I will draw the minister to the bill, but he has only been on his feet for less than a minute so it is probably a debating point at this stage. Hold fire for a few more minutes, perhaps. 

Dr Woodruff - Maybe you could talk about the real reason - wanting to keep it off the news tonight. 

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Leader of the Greens.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=85.6_D=10.8_C=0.75] Mr ABETZ - Thank you, Speaker. You really know when you are onto something, when the Greens raise a point of order trying to throw you off track.

Ms Rosol - Or filibuster all afternoon like you are.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=98.6_D=29.4_C=0.79] Mr ABETZ - Throw you off track. When it comes to matters custodial, it is important to consider what we are dealing with -

Ms Rosol - What the Custodial Inspector says. That is what this is about.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass, you are warned. 

Mr ABETZ - and some of the issues that this government now has to deal with, including, might I add, the Hayes Prison Farm, which was so vitally important for rehabilitation and getting people ready  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=128.3_D=28.1_C=0.75] to go into the outside world again. That was fundamentally important, and why do the Greens not want to hear that? I dare say they may have had some involvement in its closure.

Ms Ogilvie - They mucked it up.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, minister Ogilvie. You can stop talking too.

Mr ABETZ - She is a great help, Speaker, and doing a wonderful job.

The SPEAKER - In here the rules that apply to everyone else also apply to her. Thank you very much, minister. 

Mr ABETZ - She is doing a wonderful job  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=157.1_D=0.8_C=0.86] in her role. The government looks at the whole picture. We try to have a look at all the matters that have been raised by the custodial inspector in recent years. I think the minister may have mentioned, as well as minister Ellis and the member for Clark, Mr Behrakis, the numerous recommendations from the custodial inspector in recent years. I think the minister might be able to assist me with this, with your leave, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - Perhaps.

Mr ABETZ - There were 511 recommendations and only 34 of them are outstanding, which indicates a mindset and a determination to deal with these matters in a methodical and proper way, ensuring that matters custodial are dealt with with all the competing factors in mind - as minister Ellis said, balancing the importance of a punishment and being tough on crime along with looking at rehabilitation and seeking to provide assistance to prisoners to get onto a better path in life [Bookmark: Phr11_O=189.2_D=26.0_C=0.81] . This is something that we should all be supportive of and these are always balancing matters for governments and officials to consider. Again, I note the wonderful work that our prison officers do in this regard. 

The system  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=269.0_D=7.9_C=0.87] requires a complex balance of security, rehabilitation and public safety guided by  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=277.4_D=19.8_C=0.80] that very real dedication of our officers and frontline workers. We do not need more layers to prove our resolve. We need what the minister referred to, namely a strategic approach, not the Greens' penchant for headlines over substance.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=298.9_D=2.7_C=0.71] The need for  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=303.4_D=1.6_C=0.63] rehabilitation and oversight - all those things - is fully recognised by the government. We as a government, through minister Ogilvie, are seeking to do our very best. I think that in all the circumstances, objectively observed, one would have to come to the determination that that is what is happening. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=29.2_D=8.9_C=0.70]  When you have 511 recommendations over the past 10 years or so [Bookmark: Phr4_O=38.8_D=10.6_C=0.89] , and only 34 remain outstanding, anybody, objectively, would have to say that that is a reasonable  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=51.2_D=16.3_C=0.85] workmanlike approach. It is taking the matter seriously and dealing with the issues as they arise. 

This is exactly what you would want from a government that deals with these matters in a practical [Bookmark: Phr6_O=69.4_D=24.6_C=0.83] , robust manner, in a manner that is designed to ensure that we do have security within our community that going to prison is seen as something that is to be avoided, but also keeping in mind that once we have our fellow citizens in the prison system, it is important that they then [Bookmark: Phr7_O=94.9_D=4.6_C=0.74]  be given the opportunity, and be it from young offenders [Bookmark: Phr8_O=99.8_D=15.0_C=0.84]  right through to older offenders, for rehabilitation. One of the great rehabilitators back in the day was the Hayes Prison Farm, which [Bookmark: Phr9_O=116.6_D=5.0_C=0.79]  for certain budgetary reasons, one suspects, a certain government got rid of [Bookmark: Phr10_O=124.1_D=8.0_C=0.74]  and has put a big hole in the rehabilitation sector.

Dr Woodruff - You could start it up again.

The SPEAKER - You can take a point of order if you would like.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=132.8_D=6.7_C=0.51] Mr ABETZ - There was an interjection basically saying [Bookmark: Phr12_O=140.6_D=7.1_C=0.74]  we should fix up the mess that the Labor-Greens government made. I take that  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=149.4_D=22.3_C=0.80] as an acknowledgement of what I said, that we could have fixed up the mess. We try to fix up a lot of the messes made by the Labor-Greens but certain opportunities once got rid of are very hard to get again, and once it was sold, it was sold and that was that, unfortunately.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=172.4_D=26.4_C=0.80] The young people, but also older offenders, who we are getting ready for community life again, and also those who were seen as not a danger to the community, were able to undertake meaningful tasks with a relative degree of freedom [Bookmark: Phr15_O=199.6_D=3.0_C=0.63] , being in the outside air, undertaking good [Bookmark: Phr16_O=204.2_D=26.5_C=0.86]  employment opportunities of milking the cows, growing vegetables, et cetera. 

It was genuinely something wholesome and good to observe. This applies to those who, as I said, were not a danger to the community, but also to those who had been. I remember visiting somebody up there who [Bookmark: Phr17_O=230.8_D=5.4_C=0.75]  had been convicted of murder and I was in the trial acting for a co-accused. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=237.9_D=27.6_C=0.77]  He was convicted of manslaughter rather than murder, thankfully. Nevertheless, I was invited by the co-accused to see him at the Hayes Prison Farm. After a period of about a decade at Risdon, he had been able to show himself to be of such a character that he was able to be transferred to the lower [Bookmark: Phr19_O=266.2_D=7.7_C=0.46] -security Hayes Prison Farm - from which, might I add, he has l [Bookmark: Phr20_O=275.9_D=14.4_C=0.80] eft, has not reoffended, and has been making a good contribution to our society There are many good stories to be told about our [Bookmark: Phr21_O=292.0_D=7.9_C=0.83]  custodial system, and I know it is popular in certain quarters to try to say that [Bookmark: Phr22_O=302.0_D=2.0_C=0.48]  there are problems in the system and there are. When a Custodial Inspector makes more than 500 recommendations over the years, then they are things we look at, but we should not denigrate the whole system on the basis of the improvements that are recommended and that we then seek to implement and pursue on a regular basis.

As the minister said, she is about practical results, trying to do that which works for the benefit of those who are having the custodial experience, which is something we would not wish on anybody, but something which needs to be imposed from time to time by our independent judiciary in circumstances where a form of punishment or a degree of community security is required, to assist the individual to reconsider his or her ways.

I indicate to the House that these sorts of motions, these sort of bills, at the end of the day do not assist in this very sensitive area which minister Ogilvie is handling exceptionally well, by bringing these ad hoc bills along the way to try to get a headline to somehow virtue signal and not consider all the various aspects and issues that arise. A mature consideration of such a sensitive area as this surely requires any party, or indeed any parliamentarian to seriously balance up all those considerations that are vitally important for a mature, consistent approach to all these matters custodial.

I submit to the House that the matters raised by minister Ogilvie, by the member for Clark, Mr Behrakis, and minister Ellis before me should be exercising members' minds and the bill that has been suggested be promoted -

Time expired.

Bill read the second time.

The SPEAKER - Is a committee required?

Ms ROSOL - Yes please.

The SPEAKER - Thank you. As a committee is required under the Standing Orders, we will be dealing with that at the conclusion of all other private members' time.


MOTION

Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation

[4.06 p.m.]
Mr WINTER - Honourable Speaker, a vote will be required. I move -

That the House does not support the Premier's policy to privatise Tasmania's assets.

I rise today to speak on a very important motion, an agenda item that the Premier placed firmly on Tasmania's agenda only a few weeks ago out of the blue with Tasmanians being shocked at the prospect of yet another Liberal government seeking to sell the assets that they built, they own and they love. The House has a big decision to make about where it sees its government businesses, where it sees the economy and where it sees the Budget going. I see this Budget in serious distress under the leadership of the Liberals.

The Liberals have wrecked our Tasmanian Budget. They inherited $200 million-worth of net cash and investments and they have turned that into a pathway towards not a surplus as they claim, but a pathway towards $10 billion worth of net debt and continuing to rise. The Liberals talk about a pathway to surplus, but they have no pathway at all. They have no pathway to even an operating surplus and the longer this continues to go, the higher the debt will stack up. We have seen this before: from 1998 when the Liberals tried to sell Hydro Tasmania at the last dying breaths of a former, failed Liberal government. Once again they are trying it on, Deputy Speaker, and Tasmanians will not stand for it. The motion in front of the House today asked the question of the House: do you support privatisation or not? It is asked very clearly for the House to give an indication of its support. As the other place did, only yesterday, this House will give a very clear indication of its thoughts, and decisions need to be made by this House about whether we are going to allow this agenda to continue. 

We do not support this agenda continuing in any way, shape or form. Since that announcement by the Premier in his state of the state speech, we have been working and looking at the ways in which we can stop this privatisation agenda from going forward. We have some initial research, which outlines to us that in the Government Business Enterprises Act 1995, section 10(7) outlines that except with the consent of the portfolio minister and Treasurer, a government business enterprise must not:

dispose of a main undertaking; or

allow its subsidiary to dispose of a main undertaking. 

And in (8): 

A consent under subsection (7) is of no effect until it is approved by both Houses of parliament.

What this means is that the undertakings of a government business must not be disposed of without the express support of the House and of the other place. It leads us to the question that we asked the Premier today: if the House expresses no support for his agenda and we know the other place has expressed no support for his agenda, is he going to, as he says, just plough on, plough on into nothingness, of pushing to sell assets the Tasmanians know they love, they built and they want to retain in public ownership? 

We will not allow him to do that. As I said, the House today has a choice about whether it supports this motion and sends a clear message and directive to the Premier or not, and I certainly hope that it will. Tasmanian Labor, since this approach, has moved for an inquiry into, effectively, the Premier's economic agenda for the state. That is his privatisation agenda and I am very pleased that the House supported that. It is important, with the Premier putting this firmly on the agenda, that the House is able to scrutinise every single aspect of it. I look forward to participating in that, as one of those members, along with other members, as we interrogate government businesses, the private sector in Tasmania, unions, working people, people who rely on the services that are provided by government businesses, but that does not mean anything other than we want to tear this agenda apart, deputy speaker.

We do want to tear it apart because we do not believe that this is in the right interest of Tasmanians. We already have the evidence in front of us. On that, we have to go back to the Premier's state of the state speech, go back to where we came from and he gave two distinct reasons for putting privatisation of our government businesses on the agenda: to pay down debt and because of the TT-Line project. I will start with the first point, paying down debt.

This is a Tasmanian Liberal government that inherited no net debt, $200 million worth of net cash and investments in the bank in 2014 and since that time, they have completely wrecked our budget and, as Saul Eslake said, it is entirely their fault. These are policy decisions of the Tasmanian Liberal government. They are not circumstances outside of their control. These are circumstances that they created, decisions that they made, consciously and deliberately, and they were decisions that they were warned of repeatedly.
I remember in 2021, standing up in this place with the Tasmanian Government Fiscal Sustainability Report 2021 and looking at it, reading from it and looking across at the then-Treasurer and asking what they were going to do about it, because this report says that the longer it takes to take corrective action, the worse the consequences get. That was the Department of Treasury and Finance telling them that, their own department saying, 'unless you take corrective action things are going to get worse' and here we are four years later; four years after the publishing of that excellent report by the Department of Treasury and Finance. They have taken no corrective action. In fact, the circumstances we are in today are worse than even the worst predicted outcome under that report. They had a high expenditure and a net operating balance. Things are actually worse than in the worst scenario modelled by Treasury. That is how bad they are.

The situation continues to deteriorate, and we still get rhetoric from the government saying we are good economic managers or we are good fiscal managers, whilst they are literally selling our Tasmanian assets to pay down the debt that they have created. We have a Treasurer of Tasmania who likes to say the debt is manageable. The debt is perhaps manageable this year, but if you look at the outlook years, nearly $10 billion worth of net debt is being built up by this Treasurer over the next three years to a point where it is not sustainable.

The direction this Budget is heading in is absolutely not sustainable. They have decisions to make, and the decision they have made is to try and sell the assets the Tasmanians know and love, that we built and that we paid for. This is a diabolically bad idea.

That was the fiscal sustainability report - a warning to the government to take corrective action four years ago and they did the exact opposite. Every budget we have seen since then, we have stood at this lectern and highlighted the severe problems. Net operating deficits at record levels, cash deficits at record levels, fiscal deficits at record levels, and over the course of the last three years post-COVID, the deficits continue to rise - billion-dollar deficits.

The level of deficit is something that no one could have ever imagined only five years ago. These deficits are far greater than what we experienced during COVID, far greater than during the global financial crisis, when the Liberals wanted to blame everything on the then Tasmanian government for what were far smaller deficits than those we are experiencing right now. 

Deficits are at record levels in the state and compare very poorly against other states and territories. We have gone from having the strongest balance sheet in Australia when they came into office to having the weakest by the time we get to the end of this budget cycle. That is their record and that is where they have got to.

The Eslake Report - another excellent report that has been largely ignored by the government - outlined the severe problems in August last year. Saul Eslake found that Tasmania was headed towards $16 billion worth of net debt by 2035, the worst position of any state or territory. In spite of that, you still have the Treasurer of Tasmania saying that it is manageable. Is Saul Eslake right, or is Treasurer Guy Barnett right? I will let Tasmania decide which one of those two has got it right.

Mr Eslake said in his review of state finances that the deterioration of the state's finances was entirely attributable to government policy decisions. That is the Liberal government's policy decisions. They have no one else left to blame. We are in this cycle that has played out over the last 12 months - they used to stand up here and figure out a way to blame it on the previous government, but they have run out of excuses. There is no one else to blame. When you have been in government for 11 years, the only people you can blame are yourselves, and they are struggling with that.

The report said Tasmania's fiscal position was on track to become the worst of any state or territory over the next three years, and the deterioration is entirely attributable to state government policy. He warned against slashing the budget and instead called for higher taxes, but admitted that returning to a sustainable position would be substantial and a politically challenging task.

That it is. This government has not said they will jack up taxes. What they said instead was that they would start selling our assets. Here is the problem. The problem with that approach is that those assets that they are seeking to sell are contributing back into Tasmania's budget. TasNetworks has been contributing hundreds of millions of dollars back into our budget; Motor Accident Insurance Board (MAIB) has been contributing hundreds of millions of dollars back into our budget - and they have been doing so, particularly MAIB, while keeping prices relatively low.

MAIB is the model scheme for any state or territory. For what it does, it is the best and the people we have spoken to - industry experts - tell us the last thing you should do with this asset is sell it. It is contributing huge amounts back into your budget, it is keeping prices low for Tasmanians and it is there when they need it. 

The idea of putting this asset up for sale has not been recommended by Saul Eslake. In fact, this asset is one of the key components that supports our budget. We do not support that sale either for very obvious reasons that should be apparent to the Liberal government. We received that Eslake Report, then S&P put out a statement. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=49.0_D=24.3_C=0.70]  Last September, S&P warned that the Liberals were now closer to having a weaker credit rating than they had expected prior to the Budget, and said that the Budget contained:

… a frank admission that the state is going to breach all of its own targets for fiscal management.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=76.6_D=10.1_C=0.81] Moody's also said that the Premier's 480 election promises would have 'quite a negative impact' on the state's financial position, while also expressing concerns about the breaches of fiscal strategy. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=87.2_D=9.8_C=0.74]  They went on to say:

The financial parameters are set… he general expectation is that they will be managed to. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=98.7_D=27.5_C=0.81]  When an entity steps outside of that, it creates questions as to its willingness… to make hard decisions to maintain the commitment to those metrics.

The credit rating agencies appear to have lost faith in the government's ability to manage its finances - to stick to its fiscal targets and its own fiscal strategy - because they have shown no fiscal discipline. We have seen that earlier this year when we were asked to pass quite an extraordinary amount of money - half a billion dollars [Bookmark: Phr7_O=127.0_D=2.2_C=0.75]  in additional spending this budget year.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=129.8_D=28.6_C=0.84] This is a government that went to the budget late last year saying that they were going to spend less money on health this year than they did the year before - cuts - and then, as everyone expected, had to come back to the parliament and ask for nearly half a billion dollars because they had under-budgeted. The budget was a fantasy when it was written, and it turned out to be exactly that when we had to deal with the additional spending that came to this House. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=159.6_D=14.8_C=0.81]  It was a fantasy budget from a government that has completely lost control of its finances. They then have an expectation that Tasmanians pay for it through the loss of the state's GBEs.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=176.0_D=25.4_C=0.77] In January we had the Moody's downgrade following the S&P Global Ratings downgrade. Moody's projected a rise in Tasmania's debt burden to around 168 per cent in the fiscal year ending June 2028 from 107 per cent in fiscal year 2024. In a damning assessment of the Premier's leadership, Moody's said that its decision reflected:

…the increasing risk that the Tasmanian government will be unlikely to  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=202.2_D=7.9_C=0.79] implement sufficiently effective countermeasures to restrain a sharp increase in the debt burden over the next three to four years, indicating a weakening in the state's governance.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=211.0_D=24.4_C=0.83] That is from an international ratings agency. They called it 'a weakening in the state's governance' under the leadership of Premier Jeremy Rockliff and Treasurer Guy Barnett. That is the assessment from an international ratings agency. This leads to a negative outlook, which then leads to a credit downgrade and further [Bookmark: Phr13_O=236.1_D=1.5_C=0.82]  fiscal issues for our budget.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=239.6_D=3.4_C=0.47] This led to yet another Eslake report [Bookmark: Phr15_O=243.5_D=8.2_C=0.84]  warning the government of much the same thing after the revised Estimates report that came out in February 2025. Mr Eslake outlined again [Bookmark: Phr16_O=253.8_D=21.0_C=0.81]  the absurdity of the government's response or lack of response to his initial report, and the absurdity of their claims that the debt was manageable. It is not. He reflected on the absurdity of their claims that they were managing the budget effectively and efficiently. They are not. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=276.1_D=23.4_C=0.84]  It has been a complete train wreck, budget after budget, and the Eslake presentation that night generated a huge amount of anxiety and concern around the Tasmanian community about the current position that we are in and the government's proposed response [Bookmark: Phr18_O=300.4_D=4.6_C=0.66] . 

Mr Eslake outlined the general government sector net debt, highlighting in his own figures that the Tasmanian Liberals - again, you can listen to Treasurer Guy Barnett who outlines in his own presentation - that the Liberals inherited no net debt. In fact, there was cash and investments in the bank. They have built up steadily, since 2021, almost $10 billion worth of net debt. They have taken us from having the strongest balance sheet to the weakest balance sheet in only a few years, all overseen by one premier.

Net debt has skyrocketed under one premier; record deficits every single year under one premier; fiscal discipline that has been thrown out the window. Again, their only response so far? Freezing public servant jobs and seeking to sell the assets that help support Tasmania's budget.

That is the first reason the Premier gave. He said the debt was too high and he needed to start selling assets. That is the rationale, effectively, coming out of the government - that we have a budget crisis, that we have broken the budget, and we need to start looking at what we can sell off in a fire sale.

The second thing he said was the Spirit of Tasmania debacle has caused us to think about what government businesses we should actually own. Now, let me just run through this for the House. The Premier of Tasmania has been the tourism minister for three years. Yes, he was not a shareholder minister of TT-Line or TasPorts, but TT-Line is kind of a big deal for the tourism industry. Up until 12 months ago, he did not know he was bailing out a Finnish shipbuilder. He did not know he had not built the berth to be ready for a billion dollars' worth of new ships. He did not know any of it.

Having seen the debacle for himself - or at least the aftermath; he did not seem to know much about it while it was happening - he arrived for the state of the state speech and said, 'This has caused me to really consider what's important.' Not governance - he thought, 'Oh, maybe we should just sell it. I can't manage it, so maybe we should just sell it.' That is his actual rationale for selling government businesses. He had stuffed up building the berth, he had lost his deputy premier over it, and the response was, 'If we just sell it, I won't have to manage it.'

If you look at the GBEs right across the board and the way they have been managed, perhaps that is why he has put everything up for sale. He has put Metro up for sale because the government cannot get the buses actually running. They have been on temporary service delays for years. The only government in Tasmanian history that has been unable to run a public bus service, and their response is to say, 'We can't manage public transport anymore, we don't want to manage public transport anymore, so we're going to sell it.'

This is a government that said, 'We have this 200 per cent renewables target and we legislated it back in 2020, I think. It's 200 per cent by 2040. Now, we're quarter of the way in, and we haven't added a single kilowatt of new generation, one quarter of the way into doubling it. Now, let me do the maths… That's not working out very well. So we'll sell the energy assets, and if we sell them, we won't have to manage them.' That is the dumbest idea I have ever heard. If we actually want to have a strategic investment in Tasmania's energy industry, we actually have to own it, we actually have to invest in it, and we actually have to deliver it.

This is a government that has failed fundamentally on energy for 11 years. This is a government that announced in opposition - Matthew Groom, shadow minister for energy back in 2013, in an Examiner article, said, 'We're going to build a second link to the mainland.' That is where it all started, more than 11 years ago. Here we are, 11 years later. They have not laid any cable, none at all. They used to talk about Lake Cethana and pumped hydrogen; have not heard a peep out of them about that for years. They say they are building Marinus - no one knows where it is and then North West Transmission: honestly, you might have heard me laugh; I was on the north-west coast when I saw the government's release that came out about that last week. Dead set, they are all over the shop when it comes to energy.

I printed it out, and I am glad I did. Minister Duigan has had more positions on this in the last week than anyone has had on anything. Today, he seems to be opposed to the North West Transmission. Last Saturday he was for it, and admittedly back to the Tuesday before, he was against it again. Let me run you through it. It is quite important that we understand exactly where the minister, Mr Duigan, is coming from. On 25 March, the Minister for Energy and Renewables, who also oversees these GBEs, said:

We have been clear what needs to be built will be built in a careful and considered way. Their plan -

He means mine -

- to maximise profits was not enough. They will also send power prices soaring, adding to the multitude of fees and charges they are planning to jack up to manage the budget. It is reckless for the opposition to green-light a $1.5 billion project without fully understanding whether it is in Tasmania's best interests. 

He is talking about the North West Transmissions Developments, his own project. In fact, it was the now Treasurer of Tasmania, the former minister for Energy, who announced it. He is actually attacking his own project as being too expensive to build and too expensive to run. It is his own project. That is what he is talking about.

There has been a bit of an issue with the government around the business community. They put a statement out late last year that said, 'It will be hard to ever trust the Liberals again.' I have not forgotten it and I never will. It was a scathing release from the business community about the way this government performs. I believe they received a couple of phone calls about this release from Mr Duigan. We had our Energy minister go out on Saturday. Janie Finlay also went out and backed our position that we need to see more renewables in the grid. We want to see Tasmania's economy grow, we want to see things like Abel Energy and HIF going forward, and we want to see Robbins Island. In order to do that, you need to build transmission to connect them to things.

Ms Finlay goes out, backs Labor's position - a position we have held for a long time. We get this new release from the Minister for Energy and Renewables, saying:

We remain resolute in our plan to grow our renewable energy generation and while Labor talk about having an energy plan, we are getting on with delivering one.

Having said he was not delivering it on the Tuesday, he is delivering it on the Saturday. Today, he appears to be saying he is not delivering it again. In today's release, he was talking about Labor saying they were going to build the full North West Transmissions again and that prices would go up. Now, that is his position. They are saying they are building the North West Transmissions Developments, I think, but we do not know anything about it. How much is it going to cost? Where is it going to be delivered? Have they done a deal with the landowners?

Just because this government cannot manage GBEs and has Nick Duigan as their Energy minister, does not mean that a future government will too. A future government I lead wants to back our government businesses. We want to see them grow our economy. We want to see them back our renewable energy efforts. We want to see new manufacturing. We want to see that when businesses like Boyer say they want to grow our economy and have more power so they can create more jobs, they have a Hydro in Tasmania that can say yes, instead of no. When Abel Energy says, 'Please give us some power so we can go ahead and put green methanol at Bell Bay,' we want to be a government that says yes. Instead of saying goodbye to Origin Energy, Woodside and Fortescue like this government, we want to be a government that says yes, we want to see investment.

However, as soon as they start selling these assets, as soon as they sell TasNetworks and put a 99-year lease on it, as soon as they start selling parts of Hydro because that is what they want to do, they lose control over the strategic assets that are so important for our state. As soon as they start selling TT-Line, we will not be able to do things like double day sailings to support our tourism industry. As soon as they start selling government businesses that back jobs and investments, we will not have the strategic oversight we desperately need. 

As soon as they sell our ports, we will not be able to have control of them. They could sell them to overseas operations, and what does that do for our state? We are an island state and this is a government that wants to directly sell the links that get our produce off the island, get tourists onto the island and get Tasmanians to see the rest of the country. We will not stand for it, so we do not support this privatisation agenda. We do not support it because it is a fire sale. We do not support it because it is not in Tasmania's best interest. We will not stand for it.

We will pull apart this agenda bit by bit, through the committee process and question time, and use absolutely everything we have to stop this agenda. We do so because so many Tasmanians have told us about their love for these businesses. They have told us they want to see TasPorts improve, rather than be sold. They want a TT-Line that can operate a ferry service properly, that remembers to build a berth, but they know they cannot get that if it is sold. They want a bus that arrives on time, but they know they will not get that if it is sold. They want to see the budget get back on track, but they know it cannot do that if we are selling the government businesses that have been supporting our budget for years. The investments people like premier Eric Reece made in our Hydro have been so great because they have continued to pay for our schools and hospitals today. If you are getting a public service in today, there is every chance it is being supported by dividends given to us by the government businesses that Tasmanians continue to enjoy.

The government has been trying to demonise me for saying we want our government businesses to be profitable, and the Treasurer is grinning about that. I do want the government businesses to be profitable. I want them to continue to support the Tasmanian economy. They cannot be profitable with you running them, though, Treasurer. They cannot be profitable when you are running projects that are half-a-billion dollars over budget, when you are running TT-Line so it is losing the Tasmanian economy $3 billion over six years. They cannot be profitable if you are stuffing up projects like the North West Transmissions, if you cannot get Marinus built. They cannot be profitable if you cannot build Lake Cethana. They cannot be profitable if you have sold them.

Their plan is to sell them, our plan is to fix them. I want to see government businesses that have proper scrutiny and oversight. That is why we announced the government business governance framework late last year, before the government did, to ensure there is proper scrutiny, so we do not have single ministers with single points of control over whole businesses. We ended up in this mess because then treasurer Michael Ferguson had full oversight of both TasPorts and TT-Line at the same time and he did not pay attention to either. He allowed those two businesses to continue to fight amongst themselves. We had a minister of the Crown, Michael Ferguson, telling the Chair of TT-Line he just needed to learn to play in the sand pit a little better. A disgraceful approach. 

We need to have proper scrutiny of these businesses. We do not need to have them sold. We need to have proper businesses that continue to support our economy, to grow it, that continue to support it with businesses that are profitable. Profit is good, Treasurer. Profit is important for our government businesses. We want them to be successful. We do not want them to fail, but they cannot be profitable with you running them.

Today, it is important for the House to send a message to the government that we will not stand for the agenda it has set forward; that the budget mess they have created is their fault; that it should not be up to Tasmanians to sell the assets they know and love, that they built, to pay down the debt they built up. The government has created an enormous problem, but it should not be a problem that Tasmanians spend generations paying off. When I say that, I mean the 99-year lease of TasNetworks. Selling it once means we will not get the benefit of it for years. It means we will not have the strategic ability to run them, to grow our economy, to support new projects and will not get the dividends they have been paying to our budget for many years. I urge the House to back this today. I expect the government will be putting amendments. This vote today is important. It should not be watered down. It should be supported and we should send the Premier and the Treasurer a message.

[4.35 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Deputy Premier) - Honourable Speaker, I am happy to speak to this motion in response to the spray we have just heard from the leader of the Labor Party. At least he has one thing right: we will not be supporting the motion, and I will foreshadow an amendment and speak to that shortly.

The opposition leader is speaking with a forked tongue, saying one thing out of one side of his mouth, having said another thing out of the other side of his mouth. He is acting in a most hypocritical, cowardly way because he has put his support for privatisation on the public record. I can see the shadow treasurer smiling over there because he knows what this means. He knows there is a glimmer of hope in terms of the leadership of the Labor Party. You will just have to wait and see. Mr Winter said on the public record in 2015, less than a decade ago:

If you look at the research in Victoria, where electricity assets are privatised, they pay less for electricity, and that means every single mum and dad, business, and home pay less. 

There you have it: a pro-privatisation Mr Winter  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=26.0_D=3.8_C=0.88] on 27  November 2015 on ABC Radio.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.9_D=28.6_C=0.82] What has changed all that? I suspect the union movement did attempt to stop his preselection at the time. He made those valiant efforts and did get back into parliament, but when asked about the 2015 comments, he emphasised that Tasmanian Labor does not support privatisation. Then, he said: 'My position is on the record.' I have just read what his position is on the record.  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=59.8_D=30.0_C=0.77] There we have it, a Labor leader who is pro-privatisation one day and anti-privatisation the next. 

The Premier summed it up beautifully in an earlier debate where he talked about this side of the House having courage and conviction to do what is best for Tasmania and is in the best interests of Tasmania, highlighting the cowardice of state Labor and the Leader for the Opposition. I put it in another way when I said the Leader for the Opposition does not have the ticker to stand up for his convictions.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=89.9_D=29.0_C=0.81] What else does state Labor stand for? We have had quite a spray from Labor. They supported a decade of deficits announced by the federal Treasurer in terms of the federal budget - a decade of deficits - and yet we have heard this spray this afternoon of unfounded  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=119.8_D=1.8_C=0.65] allegations from state Labor  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=122.8_D=4.1_C=0.93] with respect to our budget and our plans for the economy. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=128.6_D=22.5_C=0.80]  A trillion dollars of debt and a decade of deficits. 

Mr Willie - Who caused the debt? The Liberal Party.
Mr BARNETT - You have the shadow treasurer saying that that was a responsible decision. It seems very hypocritical indeed. This is the same party that in government raided  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=152.0_D=16.0_C=0.80] the $1.5 billion superannuation guarantee fund. 

Mr Willie - You have $10 billion worth of record debt. Unbelievable.

The SPEAKER - Shadow treasurer, a reminder that you are still under warning.

Mr BARNETT - The shadow treasurer laughed as though it was no big deal. Guess what? It is a big deal, and you should be ashamed of yourself, because not only did we suffer  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=183.9_D=28.8_C=0.80] under that Labor-Greens government with 10,000 jobs lost, but the economy went into recession. Two out of three jobs in the forest industry were lost and thrown onto the unemployment scrap heap, but they suggest in more recent times that they left the place in a good position. That is not true. We did not inherit no debt. The 2013-14 Budget Paper makes it clear that:

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=212.7_D=10.3_C=0.80] It is estimated that net debt will be $226.1 million as at 30 June 2014 and will increase in 2015.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=224.5_D=18.6_C=0.76] Labor charted a pathway to debt for us in the state of Tasmania. The RER in February 2014, and the risk report which we requested Treasury to prepare after we took over the budget we were left with, showed net debt was not zero but was pushing  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=243.6_D=26.1_C=0.85] half a billion dollars, over $400 million in 2016-17. There you have it. They raided the superannuation provision account, spent $1.5 billion of taxpayers' money and left Tasmanians to fix the liability completely unfunded. That was the position of the majority Liberal government at the time, so let us sort that one out right up front.
 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=270.7_D=1.4_C=0.95] 
In terms of  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=273.2_D=18.7_C=0.86] Mr Winter's plans, he has made those clear. He says that he wants to milk the profits from the GBEs big time. He will not only milk them, he will force Tasmanians to pay extra  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=292.2_D=12.8_C=0.75] for their car and vehicle registrations, to pay extra on the buses and in other respects, because he wants to milk the GBEs. 

We have a plan for team Tasmania under our plans, to improve customer service, to improve the services for the people of Tasmania, and they will deliver under this 'team Tasmania' plan where we are working with industry and business. We have said we are backing industry, backing business, and that is exactly what we are doing.

Labor's track record is not so good. In fact, there is little to no credibility whatsoever, because we have heard a lot about the energy assets from the Leader for the Opposition this afternoon, and, of course, it was his government in power when the electricity prices went up 65 per cent. That is not a good record when, since we have been in government, they have gone down in real terms for residential customers and small business, of which there are now more than 40,000 in Tasmania, for which we are very proud, and we are putting our shoulder to the wheel to support them all the way.

There has been reference to the hypocrisy of state Labor, and I just want to make it very clear with a very good example used last week: Hobart Airport. That was sold under the Labor government, some $300 million, passed legislation, and it is very clear that there is further investment in Hobart Airport. What about the TOTE in 2009? Do we remember that? Everyone remembers the saga under state Labor at the time. After previously saying it was not for sale, eventually they got $103 million dollars - $250 million less than the purported sale price, and less than the Auditor-General said it was worth. Then of course, they have tried in 2009 and since, to sell Aurora Energy, and I believe in 2012 as well it was back on the table. In terms of what is on the public record of state Labor, there is just a selection. I just draw that to your attention in response to the unfounded and unfair spray by the Leader for the Opposition.

I have said our debt is manageable. It is manageable. We do have a pathway to surplus. The Premier has made that clear; I have made that clear. You will see more on 29 May when I deliver the budget for and on behalf of this government. We already have among the lowest general government debt to revenue, debt per capita, of all the states. You have referred to it as not being manageable. It is manageable, we are working our way through it and I will have more to say on 29 May. I have talked much about the importance of infrastructure. We have invested in infrastructure $6 billion under our government, and the last Budget had another $5 billion over the forward Estimates to invest in infrastructure.

Labor has no plan, you see. No alternative budget in 11 years: no alternative budget and not one costed policy. Please come forward with a costed policy. Not one in 11 years. Come on. The Opposition treasury spokesperson pretty much confirmed this afternoon that he has no intention of providing an alternative budget on 29 May. That is how I heard it, and that is pretty much what you said in the debate earlier this afternoon. If you want to deny it during the debate, you are more than welcome, but that is effectively what you said earlier today.

We have big plans for Tasmania and we have plans to do what is in the public interest, and that is exactly what we are doing. The Premier and I outlined that in early November with the release of the discussion paper regarding GBE reform, and it is all part of our plans. The 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future does make our highest priority growing our economy. I have made it very clear that you need a strong economy to reinvest into health, into education, into housing and into police. You need that strong economy and that is what we intend to deliver. We are proud of that record, with a lot more to do. We have a bold and decisive action. That is what we are on about and we are undertaking a comprehensive shake-up of our government business enterprises and state-owned corporations. It is certainly the biggest shake up in more than 30 years and it is not simply making minor adjustments. 

We are taking a holistic approach. Our goal is to create a governance framework that is integrated, cost-effective, transparent and open and, above all, responsive to the needs of Tasmanians. The reforms we are implementing will ensure a coordinated approach to investment decisions that drive economic growth, improve service delivery of essential services that underpin our economy and our community, maximise economic gains and efficiency improvements and a sustainable future for government-owned businesses. Under our plan, government businesses will put Tasmanians first.

I have talked about Team Tasmania. That is a key theme. I speak and share with the industry roundtables about the importance of Team Tasmania. There is absolute commitment to that around those round tables and talking to business and industry alike. What it means is improved governance structures, improved governance overall. It will be real-time accountability, expanded performance monitoring and strengthening mechanisms to rectify poor performance. We need to ensure sound oversight. We will legislate clear board management mechanisms, limit the number of boards one can actually sit on and ensure strong Tasmanian representation in leadership roles. We will enhance the role of the shareholder ministers to reinforce accountability and introduce board performance reviews and auditor-general assessments.

We recognise that real reform cannot happen in isolation and that is why we released the draft plan for government businesses back in November. We have had extensive consultations before Christmas, post-Christmas and we are getting on with the job. We had 48 submissions to that draft plan. The industry reference group is working really well. I thank all members for their contribution on that reference group. We have met multiple times and their continued input is greatly appreciated. Likewise, with the GBE chairs and CEOs, I thank them for their contributions and ongoing consultation.

The first consultation bill was tabled on 4 March, as I said I would on behalf of the government. The six-week consultation period closes on 17 April 2025. A second tranche will follow in and around June this year. Together, this legislation will provide a contemporary and comprehensive framework to guide our government businesses for the next 30 years and beyond.

One of the key initiatives being considered, of course, is the proposed merger of TasPorts, TT-Line and TasRail. Additionally, as foreshadowed in the Premier's state of the state address, we are reviewing the entire government business portfolio to assess whether public ownership remains appropriate, including an evaluation of the economic impacts and potential merit or otherwise of divestment of government businesses. I have indicated, it is on the public record, we are seeking advice from economist Saul Eslake and he has been commissioned to conduct that initial divestment assessment work. I thank Saul Eslake for that. We have communicated directly with the Department of Treasury. I thank him for that work. It is very important and it is not looking just at divestment. There may be opportunities for restructure or other alignments that might make things even better. We will be looking at that in the not too distant future and as I say, I thank him for working with my Department of Treasury accordingly. It was released publicly in terms of the key considerations to be considered and I will just mention a few of them on the public record as a reminder.

In terms of that framework and the principles framework, we are looking at local economic growth and job creation. We are looking at community access and public benefit, competition and market fairness and fiscal and budgetary responsibility. There is a lot more included, but that is a bit of a summary of that as well. I wanted to summarise that for members and members of the public who might be interested, but the Premier and I have made it very clear, this will only progress in any of these matters so long as it is in the public interest: the short, medium and long-term public interest. It has to be in the public interest, and to make things better. It will be a Team Tasmania approach.

Mr Willie - Are you still selling the Public Trustee?

Mr BARNETT - We continue with that team Tasmania approach. Past reviews have shown that government business governance must evolve. While previous reforms have introduced accountability measures, we recognise there is much more to do. We are ensuring that our reforms are robust, future-proofed and in the best interests of all Tasmanians.

We are getting on with the job and in the time available, I want to also foreshadow an amendment and share a few remarks about this amendment to the motion. We do not support the motion and hence the amendment which I will now read through you, Speaker.
The SPEAKER - Do you have a copy that you have circulated?

Mr BARNETT - Yes, that has been circulated and shared with your clerk as well, through you, Speaker. To amend the motion, I move -

Leave out all words after the words 'that the House' 

insert instead the following: 'notes that on 12 March 2025 the House established a select committee to inquire into and report upon the potential sale of government businesses and other entities and report by 1 February 2026.'

That is the amendment and it refers to the motion that was brought forward by state Labor and passed by this House of Assembly on 12 March 2025. This Chamber has already moved a motion to have an inquiry into the government business reform agenda, to enquire into and report upon the potential sale of government businesses and other entities and report back by 1 February 2026. Why would you then come in and try and try and trump all the work of that inquiry, try and undermine the work of the inquiry? What is the point of the inquiry if state Labor wants to progress with their motion and throw it out the window without having the inquiry? It is a really weird approach. It is very much the cart before the horse.

I can understand if, after the select committee's report on 1 February next year, you then, perhaps, review the recommendations and then act in accordance with those recommendations. It is incredibly strange and I can only believe that Labor are split and the union movement have attempted to, and in fact successfully forced, the leader of the Labor Party to move this motion to try and pre-empt the work of the committee. The committee has -

Mr Winter - The problem is we tabled it before. We tabled it before the - 

Mr Bayley - It was tabled the day before. You realise that? It was tabled the day before the motion was debated. You realise that?

Mr BARNETT - Thank you for the interjection, through you, Speaker. I appreciate that, but why would you support the committee being established while having a motion to throw it out the window? It is really strange. I understand the Greens' representative will be on that committee, representatives from the Labor Party, from the government, from the crossbench. That is my understanding. I understand they are ready to go. Why would Labor want to have a motion that wants to throw it all out the window and at exactly the same time, support the establishment of a select committee. Again, speaking with a forked tongue. Unfortunately, it is the cart before the horse.

In conclusion, I do move that amendment. There is merit in that if that select committee goes ahead. It has been agreed that it would go ahead and report by 1 February next year. Why do you not let it do its work and leave your motion on the table for consideration at a later date?

In short, we do not support the motion. We do support the amendment on behalf of the government and I will allow time for other colleagues in this Chamber to share their thoughts. Thank you very much.

The SPEAKER - Further speakers on the amendment? Having said that, we do, given the shortness of time, allow both the motion and the amendment to be addressed in your contribution.

[4.45 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I will talk very briefly on the amendment and say we Greens will not support that amendment. It is just a simple statement of fact. You know that the House established that committee on 12 March. We do not come in here just to move motions to reiterate statements of fact and things that happened. I want to talk more broadly about the motion before us at the moment in terms of opposing the government's privatisation agenda. That is a motion that we will support, but certainly here and now in terms of the amendment, we will not support this amendment.

[4.57 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, the proposed amendment guts the motion completely and the government's wish here is for the House not to express its view about its agenda. This is a minority government that is in deep trouble.

They have broken the budget and now they are trying to sell Tasmania's assets to pay off the debt that they built up on their own. The amendment here today takes away the ability for the House to express its will. The other place has already expressed its opinion and put the government on notice that they will not support this. There was very little, if any, support from across the crossbench.

The opportunity for the House is to send just as strong a message to this government, to this Treasurer and this Premier that we do not support it and if you support the government's amendment, then you are effectively voting to support their privatisation agenda. I am pleased to hear the Deputy Leader of the Greens saying they will not support it and the crossbench should not support this either.

If you oppose the government's privatisation agenda, you should say so with this motion. This amendment takes away the ability to express that view. This is the point in time where members need to make their views very clear and send a message to the government they will not support it.

The support for this motion sends an indication to the government before they go ahead down the path through the Government Business Enterprise Act seeking to dispose main undertakings of government businesses. If this House wants to send the opposite message to this government that they might be willing to start supporting the sale of assets, then that is the direction they will take, so let us not let them do that.

Let us send a message today before this budget, before this process starts, that we are not supporting the sale of assets. Let us do it for all Tasmanians who want to see these businesses stay in government hands.

[4.59 p.m.]
Mr STREET (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I do want to speak briefly to the amendment because what has become clear to me since I re-joined the backbench late last year is that the amount of committee works that this parliament is doing has gone up exponentially since my previous time on the backbench.
I am on the Gender and Equality committee. I expressed some reservations about the establishment of that committee at the time of what it might do to the legislative process, but I am now a member of it and partook in the final part of its work on the Expungement of Historical Offences Bill, and I think we produced a really good report from that work.

I am on the Reproductive and Maternity Services Review Committee that Ms Haddad chairs, really important work I take seriously and I bring an objective mind, even though I am a member of the government to that work.

Again, I am on the Joint Select Committee inquiring into the commission of inquiry outcomes, again as a member of the government, trying to bring an objective mind to it. What also became clear to me is the amount of secretariat support that is necessary for all of these committees to function and the fact that we are stretching our staff to breaking point with the number of committees we have going on.

What we cannot afford are sham committees and, quite frankly, what this motion that Labor are putting forward today does is it turns the committee they established or that the House established on the 12th of March into a sham, because there is no objectivity on that committee going forward if this motion passes.

I do have to wonder whether Mrs Beswick knew beforehand that you were moving this motion today because she said on 12 March when the committee was established:

I welcome Labor's move to establish a committee and look forward to playing a constructive role. This is a golden opportunity to not only assess the pros and cons of privatisation, but to be clear about the government's obligations. 

None of that objectivity, none of that analysis of the pros and cons will take place on that committee if this motion passes because Labor have made it quite clear what their position is before the committee even starts its work. What we are doing is asking the parliament to provide secretariat support to a sham committee.

I actually think it is really disrespectful to the staff who service these committees to ask them to provide secretariat support to a committee that Labour have already formed their view on and expressed it in this House.

The SPEAKER - I will take the member for Franklin. I am happy to make a contribution about the role of committees if that is required. Thank you.

[5.02 p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I am up on the amendment. By way of  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=15.9_D=29.4_C=0.79] explanation, I do not support privatisation; I never have. I have never seen it work in a way that has been positive, particularly at a state level. I think state governments play a different role in terms of the state-owned companies and government business enterprises that they run. There is a different level of debate at a federal level with airlines and stuff like that, but I think  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=45.6_D=29.0_C=0.75] there is a role of government to intervene and to play a role. 

In terms of the history of privatisation in Tasmania and the assets that still remain, I have never supported it. I was very uncomfortable with the sale of the TOTE, which was championed by Michael Aird, Lara Giddings and Bryan Green. That was a terrible process, and it was a fire sale. We did not get the value of it. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=75.2_D=28.1_C=0.83] 

I was very uncomfortable with putting Aurora on the market in terms of a government entity. There are governments of both sides that have put various things on the table, and I have never been comfortable with that. I have been consistent my entire career about that. I do not support privatisation.

I can understand why the government has moved this amendment, for the obvious reasons,  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=104.0_D=5.7_C=0.61] but it goes to what is it? What is this parliament doing at the minute? What kind of things are we debating here?

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=110.1_D=25.2_C=0.83] I will not support the amendment because I do not support privatisation. The original motion, I support. I will not support the amendment, but what it does expose is the strategy. When Labor moved to have that committee, I thought that was sensible and actually quite smart politically, because you could, over an extensive period of time,  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=136.1_D=5.7_C=0.78] seek evidence and information and have opportunities to prosecute the case in a way that provides a greater explanation for the people of Tasmania. Evidence would be brought; you would have information where you could say, 'No we do not support it and here is further evidence [Bookmark: Phr8_O=142.2_D=30.0_C=0.75] ,' and so I support the work of that committee. I supported the establishment of that committee. 

When I saw this motion on the books, I thought, 'Okay, well I do not understand Labor strategy here, but we will just see what happens'. Then over lunchtime I saw it: a press release from the Leader of the Opposition, Dean Winter - 'Crossbench Independents must stand up to privatisation today.' This motion is about wedging us and having a crack at us. We supported your motion to establish a committee in good faith. I do not support privatisation; I never have. There is your answer to your question: never have, never will.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=193.2_D=23.5_C=0.74] In relation to this puerile debate we are having, it is young Laborish. You have given your set speech again. Good on you. It is a good speech. It actually has some good elements in it. It is supported by the majority of Tasmanians, in my view, but to waste parliament's time by putting out a committee in the previous debate and now - because if this motion gets up, and it will -  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=218.3_D=14.0_C=0.64] in my view, the amendment will fail and the original motion will get up - the House has expressed its will. The member who has just resumed his seat - that committee that you have asked people to get on and do the work on is redundant.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=232.8_D=24.8_C=0.75] I would assume that you would move a motion to stop that work because the House has expressed its will. The House has expressed its will because the numbers are there for you.

At the end of the day, this is a very important debate, and this parliamentary forward and back and trying to wedge people - that is why people do not like politics, mate. 

[5.06 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=262.2_D=0.7_C=0.97] Mr WILLIE - Honourable Speaker, I am glad the member for Franklin outlined his concerns for privatisation just then and said that he does not support privatisation, and that he will support the original motion.

Mr Barnett - Are you going to kill the committee?

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=279.0_D=1.5_C=0.74] The SPEAKER - Thank you, Deputy Premier.

Mr WILLIE - T [Bookmark: Phr16_O=281.4_D=23.5_C=0.82] here are two sides to this argument, and if you want to talk about withdrawing a committee, if the House expresses its will today, will you withdraw your privatisation agenda? is the same standard you are asking of us. Will you do that? I did not think so. The same argument cannot be made to withdraw a committee if they will not withdraw their privatisation agenda, because the House has expressed its will. There will be no pathway for your agenda. The upper House has expressed a view.

Mr Barnett - Where is your alternative budget?

Mr WILLIE - Is that the best you have? You want to have this standard that applies to us, but it will not apply to you. I think that is hypocritical in the extreme.

Mr Barnett - Try the mirror.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Premier, I have called you a couple of times. You are now warned.

Mr WILLIE - Regarding the contribution from the other member for Franklin - in terms of objectivity, he has been around for some time now. He understands that members walk into committees - sometimes they are party members; sometimes they are Independents - who express a strong view about a particular matter before a committee actually meets. This would be no different. That is exactly why this House often tries to get balance -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Thank you. Conversations will cease.

Mr WILLIE - and this is why negotiations take place in terms of committee membership, because we often try to get balance. This whole argument that it has to be objective or that members cannot have a view before they undertake an inquiry or embark upon a piece of work is absolute fantasy land.

Mr O'Byrne - Members can. You are asking the House to form a view. It is a very different thing.

The SPEAKER - The only person who should be speaking is Mr Willie. I will remind members to be conscious of reflecting on a vote on the will of the House and a vote that was taken before, which was to form the committee. You may state statements of facts about the situation that we are currently finding ourselves in. Committee obligations will be, of course, to uphold all of the rules of committee, which is to hear all evidence. I will bring the speaker to the question now. Thank you, Mr Willie. You have the call.

Mr WILLIE - The Leader of the Opposition has outlined very clearly the state's finances and the Liberal Party policy settings that have put us on this trajectory. We have had a premier walk into this place this year and say - after maintaining a position, mind you, that the debt is manageable and that there is some pathway to surplus without showing any evidence of it - and finally admit there is a problem with the state's finances. The Premier has admitted he has effectively bankrupted the state. Now there is a fire sale of government assets - assets that Tasmanians have built up for many decades with their hard work. 

They are not his to sell. He did not take his agenda to the election because he knows it stinks with the Tasmanian people. We could save the Tasmanian taxpayers a lot of money, time and effort by expressing a will. There will be no pathway for this privatisation agenda through the Tasmanian parliament. You can save on consultancy fees, you can save in inertia in government for an agenda that will not happen because there will be no pathway. If the government is asking for the committee to be withdrawn - if the House expresses its will today, they should withdraw their agenda.

The SPEAKER (Ms O'Byrne) - The question is -

That the amendment be agreed to.

Amendment negatived.

[5.17 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Deputy Premier) - Honourable Speaker, I will just confirm that we oppose the motion for all the arguments I set out earlier, and for very good reason.

[5.17 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I will be quick because I am conscious that at least Mr Jenner and my colleague Ms Burnet have a contribution to make. I will confirm again for the record, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for bringing this motion forward and confirm that the Greens will support it. The Greens do not support privatisation of our GBEs, our state-owned companies, or indeed, let me just say, the Land Titles Office, which is neither of those things and yet has been flagged by this government for consideration for sale as well.

The Land Titles Office is not a GBE and not a state-owned company. It is a really important part of the public service that deals with really sensitive information every single piece of property information that this state holds. Every person who owns property in this state is on their database. It just beggars belief. We cannot even conceive of an idea as to why the government would want to reach into the public service and pull out the Land Titles Office and privatise it. It also begs the question: what else has not yet been named up by this government in terms of state services that they may seek to reach into and pull out?

We are opposed to privatisation because it does not deliver better value for Tasmania. It leads to higher prices. It leads to poorer services. It can lead to gouging and a whole range of issues. When it comes to this government and this privatisation agenda, it has to be said that the government simply does not have a mandate to do it in the first place. They took a position to the election that was about the government business enterprises. I will take the time to read it into Hansard because it mentions nothing about privatisation. The government took to the election a policy that says:

Requiring government businesses to deliver outcomes consistent with Tasmanian Liberals policy objectives - deliver services to Tasmanians at the lowest sustainable cost while also growing our economy and engaging with businesses and community in a constructive manner.

Nothing in that speaks about flogging those GBEs for sale to prop up the budget. Nothing in there talks about privatising assets so that they can be more efficient or that they can pay down debt. It is a very clear policy. The government simply does not have a mandate for these kinds of reforms. This is a knee-jerk reaction. It is a knee-jerk reaction both to the budget crisis and indeed the Spirits fiasco.

We saw the first reaction to the Spirits fiasco was the announcement of the Government Business Governance Reform - Draft Plan. Certainly, we Greens are very supportive of a review of the governance of government businesses. It is clear that government businesses and state-owned companies are not necessarily, or are not all, or always, operating in the best interests of Tasmania. We absolutely support a review so that we can go through each government business and look at its governance and make sure it is actually operating in the best interests of Tasmania. This draft plan does not necessarily do that. We want an independent review. We think an independent review needs to come in and look at the governance structures and the approach when it comes to government businesses so that we can have an independent take on what needs to happen with the governance with those government businesses.

That is not what we are debating today. Today we are debating pure privatisation. It is not about governance reform. It is about offloading and fire-saling those government businesses so that they can prop up budget black holes and a massive escalating budget deficit and debt.

The Spirits fiasco was truly remarkable. It just beggars belief. You knock on doors in the community, you talk to people out in the community and they just ask the question: 'How on earth is it that we can spend almost a billion dollars on a couple of boats and not build a place to park them?' No one would do that in their own home. No one would go and buy a brand new car knowing that they needed to park it off the street and not build a garage or a carport to put it in. How is it?

This is in part kneejerk reaction and distraction from that level of incompetence and in part a reaction to a very dire budget situation one that, it seems, is going to get even more dire again with the Macquarie Point stadium. Debt is going to be $9.6 billion by 2028. Saul Eslake estimates it is going to be $16 billion by 2035. It is a completely unsustainable budget situation. It is a skyrocketing level of debt. Despite the claims by the Deputy Premier, the Treasurer, that there is a pathway to surplus, it is abundantly clear that there is simply no pathway to surplus. That is a mirage.

We wait with bated breath till late May, when we do see the budget and Budget Estimates, because that will be the opportunity for that pathway to be spelled out for the Tasmanian people and for us as the crossbench and opposition members to interrogate the government about it.

Instead, alongside this privatisation agenda, we also have incredibly inefficient, incredibly lazy approaches to cutting spending. It is basically 'DOGE Lite' here with Treasurer Barnett's approach to efficiency dividends, vacancy control, and actually a hiring freeze. It is simply not good enough.

GBEs and state-owned companies perform a really important role in Tasmania. In saying that, we do not necessarily support all GBEs and state-owned companies. Forestry Tasmania, for example, has long been a loss-making, destructive business. In the last decade, it sucked $30 million of direct equity transfer from TasNetworks. It has propped itself up by flogging plantations that cost hundreds of millions of dollars to establish. Tasracing, for example, is a cruel and inhumane entity and industry, and costs us $30 million just to subsidise. We have to put on the record here that we do not necessarily support every single GBE or state-owned company, and some of them, indeed, need to be closed down or completely redirected.

However, most are really critical. Most are critical in the energy, transport and infrastructure space. Privatisation is simply a measure to cost shift. It is shifting costs from the government onto the public, and inevitably, we will see fares go up, we will see services drop, we will see flexibility be compromised when it comes to the services, and it is going to deliver a really bad outcome for Tasmania.

While the government has commissioned Saul Eslake to do his - I believe I heard the Treasurer call it the 'divestment report' in this context - we will read and consider that report really closely. It will be an interesting read to see what Mr Eslake thinks about our state-owned companies and what should be done with them.

We do not support privatisation because it will deliver poorer outcomes for the state and for Tasmanians, and those are the people that we, in this place, need to keep central in our minds and in our hearts.

To finish, this notion of team Tasmania that the Treasurer talks about. I mean, what is this? What is 'team Tasmania?' We are all Tasmanians. We are all looking to do the best for Tasmania. We just have a different set of personal values, a different set of political persuasions. This is just shallow spin that tries to deflect and distract from the key issues. 

I will just put that on the record. I will sit down now, because there are only 11 minutes left and I know two other members want to make a contribution. To reiterate, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for putting this motion onto the books. We can do nothing more than support it, because we do not support the privatisation of government businesses, state-owned companies, or indeed, the Land Titles Office.

[5.26 p.m.]
Mr JENNER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I will make this as quick as possible. Obviously, I will be supporting Labor's motion for not selling off our GBEs. I spoke to the unions yesterday and they are seriously concerned about job losses. The government plans to privatise our GBEs. Many Tasmanians, they feel, will be facing job losses.

We also face the fact that I have a unique position, I guess, being from the UK and spending six years in local government when our own government sold off our government bodies. There was not one that actually provided a better service, or any cheaper. In fact, it went the other way, because these companies look for profit before anything. No investment was made in water, gas, travel. All we ever saw, as the public, was less of a service when these areas were privatised. Our water bills doubled. Our services obviously fell.

Yesterday, I was also informed at a meeting by the unions that many of the GBEs are underperforming monetary-wise, because they do not have the staff to do the jobs. You are actively losing income that this state could be putting into productivity. The Land Titles Office are months behind due to having half the staff they should have, which could double their actual income and go into the coffers of the government's budget. 

Parks have stopped issuing fines because of the backlog in issuing permits. They have given everybody a two-week grace because the actual permits are not getting out there and they do not actually know who has a permit now and who has not - once again, losing huge amounts of income.

What we do need to do is staff the GBEs properly. They could produce far more income for our budget: not 'selling off the family silver' for short-term gain. I keep that really short because I know Ms Burnet -

[5.28 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to speak against privatisation. We have seen - and Mr Jenner gave some very good examples of the situation in the UK, where companies such as Serco and other companies that took over childcare facilities were scandalised. They not only made it more expensive, but were scandalised by maltreatment and were investigated. The winner of privatisation is always the company. It is never the people. What we have before us, with the concept of privatisation of both services and assets, is folly.

We have, and Mr Bayley has talked about, the Spirits ferry disaster, and the $1.6 billion forecast for the cost of the stadium disaster, which the Premier and the Labor Party are going in eyes wide shut, running headlong into economic oblivion. Despite all of the economists that have provided economic advice, this is something that both Labor and the Liberal Party want to ignore. I do not know how many things you could ignore, and it was just earlier today that the Shadow Treasurer was suggesting that, even if the TPC does decide against backing the stadium, you want to support it anyway.

Mr Willie - Why do you not just say you are against the team? You are against the team - tell Tasmanians that.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.

Ms BURNET - We are talking about responsibility -

The SPEAKER - Mr Willie. No, shadow treasurer, I am sorry. That really is it. You are warned again. One more and you are out of here. Some latitude because of the nature of the debate, but no, not again.

Ms BURNET - The concept of just backing-in something is really financially irresponsible. There is nothing more that can be said about that. It is total financial ruin that both Labor and Liberal are looking at having the state face. Here we have the answer with the Liberal Party. They want to privatise our services, and we know how poorly that worked last time. We know with TasRail's situation where, eventually, the rail network, the rolling stock and all of the infrastructure needed to be bought back by the state. It was not a good idea. The company, Asciano, went off with millions of dollars of Tasmania's assets and money, and eventually shareholders and senior executives, when that company was bought out by Qube in 2016 for billions, there were no winners. The public did not win in relation to that. That was all about shareholders.

We have a situation where privatisation does not serve the people, and we have to ask the question: what is up for sale?

What is the government looking at selling? Is it Devonport Airport? Is it other TasPorts assets? What is on the table for sale and what is likely to happen with the assets? Will we have to buy the Devonport Airport back at some stage in the future should that be up for sale? There are lots of questions, and the government is not being honest and forthcoming with the people of Tasmania. They need to consider how this is going look and how they are really going to pay for the stadium.

By the way, the proposed Macquarie Point Stadium is on public land so it is going to be a bit of a privatisation takeover should the AFL go ahead with the stadium, whether it is a lease arrangement or whatever the case might be. They are effectively privatising public land. That area should be of the people. Mr Bayley talked this morning about the previous possibilities for Macquarie Point. We know the government ended up having to pay off a developer who was going to have an asset that probably would have been built by now, but we are still waiting for it.

There is significant concern that privatisation is on the government's agenda. It does not serve the people of Tasmania well. We know debt will continue to rise until the government takes greater fiscal responsibility. We are not seeing any evidence of that. The government is not paying heed to any of the economists' reports: Wells, Lawrence, Goddard, Gruen, Eslake and now the information found in the TPC's interim report, which is a financial analysis. This is of great concern. We only know that deals are done and decisions made behind closed doors, which should be of great alarm to this parliament.
[5.35 p.m.]
Mr FERGUSON (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, this morning the government provided the Clerks of the House with advice that Mr Behrakis and I would serve as the two Liberal Party nominees on the committee for the new select inquiry, noting that it is a membership of six: two Labor, two Liberal, Mrs Beswick, and a member of the Greens. I think the House has been treated with contempt by the movers of this motion. Nobody can do a better job than the member for Franklin, Mr O'Byrne, did in pulling apart the political strategy the Labor Party has engaged in today. Recognising that this motion is about to pass, I will carefully consider my position on that committee because I believe Mr Winter has committed a fraud on this. Only at the last sitting, this House -

Time expired.

The SPEAKER (Ms O'Byrne) - The time for debating the motion has expired. Before putting the vote, I remind members that if they believe there to be an act of contempt, there are forms of the House they may use to deal with that. The question is -

That the motion be agreed to.

MOTION

Maternal Health in Tasmania

[5.42 p.m.]
Mrs PENTLAND (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, a vote is required today. I move - 

That the House -

Acknowledges the vital role midwives play in Tasmania’s healthcare system, providing essential medical care and emotional support to mothers and babies across the State. 

Recognises the increasing strain on Tasmania’s midwifery workforce due to chronic understaffing, excessive workloads, and inadequate resources in maternity units across the State. 

Notes that Tasmanian midwives are managing unsustainable caseloads, often caring for twice as many patients as their counterparts in other states, which compromises the quality and safety of maternity care. 

Commits to making maternal health a political priority in 2025, ensuring every Tasmanian mother and baby, regardless of location, receives safe, high-quality care. 

Calls on the Government to: - 

urgently address midwifery workforce shortages through improved recruitment, retention, and training strategies, particularly in rural and regional areas; 

ensure safe staffing levels across all Tasmanian maternity units, based on best-practice models, and review the Birthrate Plus methodology to better reflect neonatal care requirements Statewide; 

upgrade maternity facilities across the State; and 


reinstate and properly resource neonatal Code Blue nurse positions across Tasmania’s major maternity hospitals to ensure emergency neonatal care is not compromised.

Today, I stand before you with a deep sense of purpose, compelled to address an issue that is profoundly personal to me, one that touches not only the lives of many Tasmanians but also reflects a widespread challenge we must face together as a state: Tasmania's midwifery sector, maternity care and the critical support available to families who experience the loss of a child. 

For many, pregnancy and childbirth brings immense joy and anticipation, feelings of hope, excitement and the promise of new life. However, for far too many families, including my own, the journey is marked with heartbreak. Before I go on, I wish to thank all the members of this House for their kind support during this difficult time and I would like to make a special mention to Mr Rob Fairs, who reached out every day to check if I was okay. A heartfelt thank you.

Shortly before Christmas, I lost my unborn baby boy. The grief of such a loss is overwhelming, a pain that words often fail to capture. It is the heartbreak that changes you, alters the very fabric of who you are and reshapes the way you view the world. It was devastating emotionally, physically and mentally but it is also an experience that has led me to this point, to the realisation that the work of improving maternity services in Tasmania must be my political focus for 2025.

In the wake of this tragedy, I received the most compassionate care from Tasmania's midwives. They not only provided exceptional medical expertise but also stood by me emotionally in my time of unimaginable loss. Their empathy, professionalism and dedication left a lasting impression on me. It is because of this care and the support of other families who have been through similar experiences that I feel driven to speak out on behalf of those who work in this sector and those who rely on these services.

Midwives are the unsung heroes of our maternity system. They are the backbone of our healthcare system, offering expertise and emotional support are one of life's most vulnerable moments. Their role in providing safe, personalised care to mothers and babies is irreplaceable and yet, despite the extraordinary dedication of midwives, dedication alone is not enough. The challenges they face are immense. They are often working under pressure, stretched thin by overwhelming workloads and faced with the uncertainty of unsafe staffing levels. It is high time we recognise that their tireless commitment must be matched with the resources, safe staffing levels and better workplace conditions they so desperately need, to continue delivering the high-quality care that every Tasmanian mother and baby deserves.

It is World Health Day on 7 April and it is fitting that their focus this year is on the wellbeing of mothers and babies. This year's theme, 'Healthy Beginnings, Hopeful Futures', is a call to action because every mother and newborn deserves the best start in life. Worldwide, every seven seconds, a preventable death claims a mother or a newborn. Nearly 300,000 women die each year due to pregnancy or childbirth, while over 2 million newborns do not survive their first month. These are lives we can and must save. We must do more by investing in midwives, strengthening maternal care and ensuring women receive quality, compassionate support before, during and after birth.

In my electorate of Bass, the Launceston General Hospital, like many of our health facilities, has consistently struggled with recruiting and retaining midwives. It is an issue that has only worsened over the years. Understaffing has reached critical levels and the effects of this shortage are being felt not only by the midwives but also the families who rely on their services. Midwives at the LGH and other facilities across the state are being pushed to their limits, forced to work under conditions that compromise their ability to provide the level of care that is essential for the health and safety of mothers and babies.

The toll of these conditions is far reaching. In many cases, midwives are working beyond their capacity, forced to care for more patients than is reasonable or safe. This level of stress and pressure leads to burnout, and tragically, some midwives are opting to leave maternity services altogether, choosing to work in other clinical areas where the demands are more manageable. This loss of talent from the maternity workforce only adds to the problem, creating a cycle that is difficult to break. We must understand that when midwives feel they cannot safely provide care, the consequences are dire. It is not just a matter of professional dissatisfaction or personal stress. It is about the safety of mothers and babies. When midwives are stretched too thin, it is the mothers and babies who suffer and we cannot allow this to continue.

It is time for us to prioritise the health and safety of mothers and babies in this state. We must ensure that midwives are supported by adequate staffing levels, proper resources and the workplace conditions they need to perform their duties without fear of their own safety or the safety of their patients. One of the most concerning issues facing midwives in Tasmania is the excessive caseloads they are required to manage. On average, Tasmanian midwives are responsible for 12 patients at a time. That is 12 mothers and at least 12 babies to one midwife. It is an overwhelming workload and in particular trouble when compared to other states such as Queensland, where midwives typically manage half that number. The stark contrast between the workload of Tasmanian midwives and their Queensland colleagues highlights the unsustainable pressure placed on our workforce.

When midwives are stretched so thin, the quality of care suffers. The ability to provide the level of personalised care that each mother and baby deserves is compromised. In Queensland, with a more manageable caseload, midwives have the time and resources to deliver care that is not only medically sound but emotionally supportive. In Tasmania our midwives are working at capacity, often juggling multiple high-risk cases which significantly increase the risk of burnout and safety incidents. In 2025, I will make maternal care my political focus because it is too important to ignore. It is not just about improving conditions for midwives, it is about ensuring that every Tasmanian mother and baby has access to the safe, high-quality care that they deserve. It is about addressing the fundamental issues within our maternity services, ensuring that those who dedicate their lives to supporting families are given the resources, recognition and respect they deserve.

The time for change is now. We cannot afford to wait any longer. Tasmania's midwifery sector and maternity care services are at crossroads and it is our responsibility to ensure that we take the necessary steps to provide and support our midwives' needs and the care that every Tasmanian family deserves. One of the strongest models of care in our state is the Midwifery Group Practice (MGP). This program provides continuity of care for women throughout pregnancy, labour and postnatal period, but it lacks a dedicated midwifery manager, leaving them without essential leadership and support. This is an unacceptable oversight and if we truly value continuity of care, then we must also value the midwives who provide it.

The way we determine staffing levels in maternity services is also deeply flawed. Birthrate Plus methodology, which is meant to assess appropriate staffing, is unclear and outdated. Only one person in Australia is permitted to conduct these assessments due to commercial-in-confidence restrictions leading to significant delays in workforce adjustments. Even worse, the approach does not properly account for the care newborns need. It treats tasks like a simple blood glucose test as a quick 15-minute job, when in fact caring for a hypoglycaemic baby requires more coordination and monitoring. By ignoring the specific need of neonatal care in staffing plans, it places even more pressure on midwives, adding to an already stretched workforce. 

When midwifery staffing levels are not met, registered nurses are often brought in to assist in the postnatal space. While they provide valuable support, they are not midwives. Mothers and babies deserve specialist care from qualified midwives, not a patchwork or stopgap measure that compromises outcomes.

The challenges extend beyond staffing. The LGH maternity unit is outdated and inadequate. There are limited birthing pools, insufficient air conditioning and a lack of facilities to accommodate partners beyond the initial birthing process. Labour and birth should be supported by an environment that fosters comfort and dignity. Every mother deserves better. The neonatal unit of the LGH is also in urgent need of reform. There is no agreed staffing tool and no fixed-term neonatal code blue nurse position. The fixed term neonatal code blue nurse position has been removed, meaning that when the neonatal emergency occurs anywhere in the hospital, a nurse must leave the unit, doubling a colleague's workload.

This is unsafe practice and must be rectified. These are serious problems, but solutions do exist. First and foremost, we must do everything in our power to fill vacant midwifery positions. This includes using agency staff while permanent recruitment is underway, offering financial incentives for midwives to return to maternity services and increasing funded student midwifery places. Many registered nurses are reluctant to train as midwives because they cannot afford to lose their income by studying.

Allowing student midwives to work at their nurse classification level as registered undergraduate students of midwifery will remove this barrier and encourage more nurses to become midwives. A market allowance should be applied to all vacant and current midwifery positions to recruit and retain staff. We must implement midwifery managers at grade 7b within the midwifery group practice to provide leadership and stability. We must introduce mandated staffing ratios across all maternity areas, ensuring transparency and safety.

Beyond the urgent need for workforce reform, there is another often overlooked and equally crucial aspect of maternity care; support for bereaved families. The devastation of losing a child is a grief unlike any other. When I lost my baby boy, I was consumed and overwhelmed with sorrow. In that darkness, I felt completely alone, grappling with the pain that words cannot adequately describe but within that darkness, there was a light, a source of hope and comfort. I was fortunate to be supported by Beyond the Rainbow, a remarkable Tasmanian charity that provides care and solace to families experiencing the unimaginable tragedy of pregnancy and infancy loss.

Beyond the Rainbow was founded by Collette Butler, a bereaved mother who has transformed her personal heartbreak into a mission to help others. Collette and her husband Nathan tragically lost their daughter Amelia in 2020 and, through their profound grief, they found a new way to support others enduring similar pain. They began by creating care boxes for families facing unimaginable loss of a child.

I was incapable of logical thought. I simply could not think straight and the care box that Collette provided me helped take away the guilt of not being prepared. It provided me with sentimental gifts to remember Emmett by. It gave my son and myself dignity during a soul destroying moment. What started as a simple donation to Launceston General Hospital has since blossomed into a state-wide initiative, with Beyond the Rainbow now providing care boxes and sibling packs to every maternity and neonatal unit in Tasmania.

Since 2024, Beyond the Rainbow has donated over 200 care boxes and 58 sibling packs, each one representing a small but powerful gesture of support. These care boxes provide essential items to families in their darkest moments, offering not only practical help, but also a reminder that they are not alone. As a mother who has experienced this pain first-hand, I can tell you the comfort these small gestures bring is immeasurable. For parents in the depths of grief, these acts of kindness offer a vital connection to others who understand, showing them that someone cares and that they do not have to face their loss in isolation.

Beyond the Rainbow has become a lifeline for many, quietly filling a gap in our healthcare system. It often goes unnoticed.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=10.7_D=5.7_C=0.92] The support they provide is not just about the physical items in the care boxes, it is also about the emotional impact -  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=17.3_D=9.8_C=0.86] understanding that grief should never be faced alone, that every lost child deserves to be remembered and every parent deserves to feel supported and cared for.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=28.1_D=30.0_C=0.78] Collette has turned her personal tragedy into an incredible service to the community, and its work is something I believe we should all champion. Organisations like Beyond the Rainbow are the unsung heroes of our healthcare system, offering strength and solace when families need it most. Beyond the Rainbow is stepping in where government services fall short. In fact, I caught up with Colette last week and she told me she has taken an annual leave day tomorrow so she can drive down to the RHH to deliver  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=58.3_D=6.1_C=0.65] 20 care packages and then run a three-hour health education session for midwives.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=65.0_D=27.8_C=0.82] Collette is developing resource manuals with information on counselling, funeral services and support groups. She is planning a statewide health professional conference to improve how our hospitals respond to baby loss. Yet, despite all this, in the past her organisation has been knocked back for government funding. Their budget submission was declined in the past. Some local councils even rejected them on the grounds that their work did not provide sufficient community benefit.  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=93.7_D=3.1_C=0.44] I ask this government how supporting grieving parents is not a community benefit. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=97.0_D=1.6_C=0.88]  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=99.4_D=9.8_C=0.81]  Making sure our hospitals are equipped to help families through baby loss should be a public health priority. It is not a nice-to-have; it is essential care.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=110.6_D=14.7_C=0.88] Improving maternity services in Tasmania is not an easy task. It will require significant reforms, investing in staffing and a commitment to ensuring that every Tasmanian mother and baby has access to the care that they deserve.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=126.7_D=23.3_C=0.80] However, it is a fight we must take on. We must ensure that our hospitals are properly staffed, that our midwives are supported with safe staffing levels and better working conditions, and that every family, no matter what challenges they face, has access to compassionate care. 

We must also ensure that services like Beyond the Rainbow continue their vital work. Grief should never be faced alone and no parent should feel forgotten. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=150.9_D=28.3_C=0.83]  I am certain that every member of this House has either experienced or knows someone who has benefited from the work from organisations like Beyond the Rainbow. This organisation and others like it provide the kind of support that no hospital system can offer. They provide more than just comfort; they provide hope when hope seems lost. 

Today I make this commitment: I will be the voice for Tasmanian midwives, mothers, babies and families. I will not stand  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=180.1_D=3.0_C=0.79] by while our maternity service continues to deteriorate.  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=184.2_D=17.7_C=0.86] I will fight for safe staffing levels, modern birthing facilities, continuity of care and proper bereavement support. Every Tasmanian family deserves a maternity system that not only delivers medical excellence but also provides compassionate, holistic care during the most vulnerable moments of their lives.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=202.7_D=13.8_C=0.77] Our midwives are dedicated, our mothers are strong and our babies are precious, but our government must do better, because healthy beginnings create hopeful futures, and every life matters.

Members - Hear, hear. 

[6.00 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=223.6_D=8.0_C=0.68] Mrs PETRUSMA (Franklin - Minister for Health) - Honourable Speaker, I rise today to speak on this motion. I thank the member for Bass, Mrs Pentland, for bringing on this motion [Bookmark: Phr18_O=232.3_D=14.0_C=0.79]  highlighting a matter of utmost importance: that of midwifery and maternity services in Tasmania. I thank Mrs Pentland for sharing her own personal story tonight about the loss  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=247.7_D=1.9_C=0.84] of your precious baby boy, because I believe that losing a child is the most unimaginable hardship, and I know that no words can truly ease the pain that you feel.
 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=261.3_D=6.8_C=0.76] 
Your courage in speaking out about your experience is truly admirable, and I reassure you that [Bookmark: Phr23_O=269.9_D=14.9_C=0.76] , like you, I too want to ensure that all parents experiencing such tragic loss receive the care and support that they need and deserve. On behalf of the Tasmanian government and as the Minister for Health, I want to assure you that I am very committed [Bookmark: Phr24_O=286.3_D=7.5_C=0.83]  to supporting meaningful change and ensuring that our reproductive and maternal health services are accessible, patient centred  [Bookmark: Phr25_O=295.0_D=10.0_C=0.77] and of high quality, where the safety and wellbeing of mothers and their babies is paramount. To this end, since I became Minister for Health, and especially from being on the committee that the member for Clark, Ms Haddad, is the chair of, I can assure this House that I have been very committed, alongside the Department of Health, to initiating measures to enhance healthcare services in these areas.

The Tasmanian government absolutely recognises the vital role our midwives play in Tasmania's healthcare system. Like Mrs Pentland, I thank them all for the essential medical care and emotional support that they give to mothers, babies and their families across our state each and every day.

Being a nurse myself and a mum of four children, I have seen firsthand the amazing work of our midwives. It has been a pleasure to meet many of them in our hospitals across the state during my five months as health minister. I agree with Mrs Pentland that our midwives are our unsung heroes, and they are the backbone of our maternity services. I know that all of us here tonight in his House agree that the support they provide is essential for fostering healthy families. We have 645 midwives registered in our state. They are the largest contributor to Tasmania's maternity workforce. The positive impact that they have on families is significant and lasting as they guide parents through one of the most transformative experiences of their lives.

I still remember the fantastic care that I received from Tasmanian midwives when I had my children. I will never forget their patience, dedication, kindness, specialised knowledge and nurturing presence for both myself and my husband. From my own positive experiences, I want to ensure that every mother and baby has access to this same type of safe, high-quality care.

I acknowledge tonight that our health system, like every other state and territory, is currently facing significant challenges with workforce shortages, with these challenges not only being experienced nationally but internationally as well. This includes challenges in the recruitment of midwives. This is why we are working hard to ensure that our midwifery workforce is sustainable and that the needs of our staff and patients who are utilising our services are met.

We have been tackling this issue with record recruitment incentives, including grants, scholarships, supports and training to attract more midwives to the profession and to Tasmania. I was also pleased to recently announce that the Department of Health will be supporting the University of Tasmania in recommencing a new Graduate Diploma of Midwifery in Tasmania next year. This will now enable our registered nurses in Tasmania to undertake the Graduate Diploma, including a residential program in Tasmania, which will support us in growing and retaining the midwifery workforce right here in our state.

This new offering is in addition to online programs that we already have in place, including providing placements for our nurses in Tasmania at both Charles Sturt and Charles Darwin Universities, with these nurses studying these courses online from Tasmania and doing their placements locally in our three hospitals in Tasmania.

These courses complement the Tasmanian government's existing measures to support midwives with their post registration education, training and continuing professional development. This includes providing relocation allowances of $15,000 for midwives who moved to Tasmania and remain employed full time with the Tasmanian Health Service for three years or more; providing supported re-entry and refresher programs for midwives seeking to return to the profession, including funding for 50 midwifery refresher program placements delivered through the Australian College of Midwives; and introducing $10,000 graduate scholarships for new midwifery graduates who start with the Tasmanian Health Service and remain employed full time for a period of three years or more.

I am also advised that under the Health Workforce 2040 strategy, 37 scholarships have been awarded to midwives under the Tasmanian Nursing and Midwifery Scholarship Program, with applications for the 2025 round recently closing last month. A postgraduate qualification allowance is also being paid to registered nurses who have completed their midwifery studies and are working as midwives.

Importantly, these measures are working. A record number of 28 midwives graduated from their studies in 2024, compared to only 13 in 2023. Pleasingly, there are already 48 midwifery students now currently enrolled for 2025, which will grow further as universities have rolling intakes throughout the year, as well as when we start our new graduate diploma next year.

Tasmania is also continuing to participate in a range of national health workforce reforms and initiatives, including work through the national Health Workforce Taskforce. The taskforce's current priorities include the development of the National Maternity Workforce Strategy 2026-2036, and implementing recommendations for the independent review of overseas health practitioner regulatory settings.

The Department of Health is also participating in consultation for the national Midwifery Futures, the Australian Midwifery Workforce Project, which was led by the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia and reviewed the current midwifery workforce in Australia. The Department is now working with other states and territories to consider the findings and recommendations of the Midwifery Futures final report to support the future sustainability of the midwifery profession across Australia.

As well as at a state level, the Department of Health is developing a Tasmanian midwifery strategy, which will include local actions to address contemporary issues such as workforce retention, capacity and capability, and birth trauma. Tasmania's first-ever Assistant Director of Midwifery has also been appointed and will enable an even more focused strategic approach to midwifery policy in Tasmania. 

I reassure the House that every effort is being made to roll out effective strategies that will boost Tasmania's midwifery workforce.

I am also advised that we are unable to verify the claim that midwives are caring for twice as many patients as their counterparts in other states. According to the 2023 National Health Workforce Dataset, when comparing the number of midwives per 100,000 women in the childbearing age range of 15 to 49 in 2023 - which is the latest data available - Tasmania has ranked fourth out of the eight jurisdictions in Australia.

I am also advised that Tasmania is one of only four jurisdictions currently counting babies in their workload management arrangements for maternity services. Tasmanian public hospitals, like NSW, use Birthrate Plus as the industrially agreed workforce methodology for midwives in our maternity services. Critically, Birthrate Plus is the only midwifery-specific workforce tool available, and applies to all operational service areas associated with midwifery care. This includes care in the hospital, a community facility, or in a woman's home; antenatal outpatient and inpatient care; one-to-one care during labour and birth; postnatal inpatient care of mothers and babies in the hospital and in the home; babies requiring additional care, and multiple births.

We do recognise that there are workforce shortages in midwifery which have been experienced nationally and internationally, which contributes to caseload issues. This is why I have already outlined why we have a strong focus on boosting the workforce, including through our measures to support midwives with their post-registration education, training and continuing professional development.

In regard to clause 4, maternal health is indeed a priority for both me and the Tasmanian government. It is also a strong focus of the current Select Committee on Reproductive, Maternal and Paediatric Health Services in Tasmania, which I had the pleasure of appearing before just last week. We look forward to considering the findings and recommendations of the committee, and will continue to listen to staff and patients about their experiences.

Importantly, the Department of Health have already accepted and are actioning all 38 recommendations for the independent investigation into the Royal Hobart Hospital's maternity services. An implementation review committee has been established, and a time line for delivery of these critical recommendations has been created.

We want to ensure that every Tasmanian mother and baby, regardless of location, receives safe, high-quality care. Our successful transfer of maternity services in the north-west to the North West Regional Hospital is an example of this.

Furthermore, I am pleased to advise the House that a recent review of that service against the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards reported positive feedback from assessors, including that the North West maternity service 'has an established culture of safety and quality improvements. It demonstrates a welcoming environment, generally recognises the importance of cultural beliefs and empowers patients to raise concerns.'

In regard to clause 5, I am pleased to inform the House that we are already working hard to address workforce shortages through several incentives, which I have outlined earlier in my contribution, such as the relocation allowances of $15,000, the re-entry and refresher programs, and $10,000 graduate scholarships.

As well, direct entry students in midwifery can now access clinical placement experiences in Tasmania's maternity services, which is important for Tasmania's students and creates a culture of learning for our staff. The Department have also introduced the role of registered undergraduate student and midwifery to support growth in direct entry students. In addition, registered nurses studying the Graduate Diploma in Midwifery are employed for the full duration of their course, eliminating the financial disadvantage often associated with taking time out to study. These incentives, alongside the reintroduction of the Graduate Diploma of Midwifery, will help to ensure our state can both train and retain midwives. 

However, we recognise there is more we can do to support both the Tasmanian community and our vital healthcare workers, which is why we are recruiting more essential workers like midwives. This is why we are undertaking the biggest health hiring blitz in Tasmania's history and why, in just over 10 months, we put on 2675 extra healthcare workers, with 875 of these being nurses and midwives.

The Department of Health, alongside New South Wales, uses the industrially agreed maternity workforce methodology known as Birthrate Plus, which is a licensed tool from the United Kingdom that calculates the total direct care midwife hours required, using clinical data from our public maternity services that captures both women and babies. Birthrate Plus assesses activity in real time at the service by scoring the level of care each woman receives. Women and babies who require additional care are scored higher, equating to a higher midwifery staffing FTE allocation to deliver the level of direct care that has been assessed and scored. As well, additional scores to ensure safe and quality maternity services are included over and above the Birthrate Plus calculations. These roles include unit managers, consultants, educators and student midwives.

With regard to the specifics of the motion, I can confirm that workforce assessments using Birthrate Plus are undertaken every three years in Tasmania, with the 2025 assessment already underway at all three maternity services within the Tasmanian Health Service.

With regard to upgrading maternity facilities across the state, there are three birthing services available in the Tasmanian Health Service: at the Royal Hobart Hospital, Launceston General Hospital and North West Regional Hospital. I am pleased to advise that significant upgrades have recently occurred in our health facilities across the state. For example, at the Royal Hobart Hospital, a new inpatient maternity unit was built as part of the $689 million K Block redevelopment, and this new facility opened in 2020. At the Launceston General Hospital, the $20 million Women's and Children's Precinct, or Lutha Building, incorporating pregnancy outpatient services, opened in 2022. At the North West Regional Hospital, a $1.35 million upgrade to facilities and equipment at the inpatient maternity ward occurred as part of the North West Maternity Service Transition Project in 2023. As well, a new $5.8 million antenatal clinic, including outpatient clinic rooms, education space and a four-bed assessment room, opened in 2022 at the North West Regional Hospital.

Stage 2 of the North West Hospitals Masterplan, released last year, includes plans at the North West Regional Hospital for a new purpose-built women's and children's precinct, including maternity inpatient services, a special care nursery, birthing suites and paediatric services.

Of course, the federal government also has a role to play here, and we have consistently been calling on the Commonwealth to increase its contribution to health funding to the 45 per cent level it should be paying through the National Health Reform Agreement. Currently, the Commonwealth is not paying its full 45 per cent contribution. This means that Tasmania will miss out on more than $1.3 billion in health funding over the next six financial years. That is over $200 million every year. That is on top of the $476 million we have already missed out on over the 10-year period from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2025. That $1.776 billion that the federal government is supposed to be paying towards the National Health Reform Agreement will go some way to addressing some of the matters we are talking about today.

Noting the current federal election campaign is now in full swing, I urge all members to join us in demanding our fair share of health funding from the Commonwealth government, whoever is in power.

With regard to neonatal Code Blue nurse positions, I am advised that maternity services already have a specialised Neonatal Code Blue Response Team in place. Neonatal first response training is also mandatory education for all maternity staff and must be completed annually. This training includes a competency assessment and ensures that all midwives are skilled in neonatal Code Blue management. Clinical escalation of care occurs through existing emergency response processes in each birthing service in Tasmania. Additionally, babies who need ongoing support are transferred to either the special care nursery or the neonatal intensive care unit. Furthermore, all neonatal Code Blue emergencies are reported through the Safety Reporting and Learning System, with incidents reviewed by senior clinicians as part of the Quality Clinical Governance Framework. 

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=12.2_D=7.1_C=0.73] I sincerely thank the independent member for Bass for bringing this motion forward and for her strong advocacy [Bookmark: Phr3_O=21.0_D=10.4_C=0.68]  and dedication to maternal health and supporting our midwifery workforce. I share her commitment, as does the government, to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all mothers and babies in Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr4_O=33.5_D=3.6_C=0.82]  and taking action to build and maintain a sustainable midwifery workforce. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=38.1_D=12.2_C=0.75]  I know we all share a common goal of wanting to ensure that all Tasmanian mothers, babies and their families have the best care to meet their needs throughout the pregnancy journey, from conception to birth and beyond. 

[6.18 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=52.8_D=0.5_C=0.15] Ms BROWN (Franklin) -  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=59.4_D=0.8_C=0.87] Honourable Speaker,  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=62.0_D=11.1_C=0.78] I thank Mrs Pentland for bringing on this motion. Telling your story in this place is incredibly brave and I sincerely thank you and [Bookmark: Phr9_O=73.8_D=7.2_C=0.88]  extend my sympathies for everything you have been going through recently. 

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=82.8_D=4.4_C=0.83] Mrs Pentland is quite right when she says that our [Bookmark: Phr11_O=89.0_D=16.9_C=0.79]  midwives are the unsung heroes of our healthcare system. They provide support to mothers and babies when we are at our most raw, our most vulnerable and when we can no longer pick ourselves back up. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=108.3_D=21.6_C=0.86]  Midwives are faced with significant challenges, including staff shortages, which is one of the primary reasons our midwives are having [Bookmark: Phr13_O=130.8_D=8.0_C=0.81]  increased workloads and stress. That potentially puts mothers and babies at risk. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=140.1_D=11.1_C=0.81]  We have seen this particularly at the Royal Hobart Hospital where understaffing has potentially caused some delays and impact on care. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=152.9_D=2.2_C=0.83]  
o
There is also evidence of  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=157.2_D=10.4_C=0.77] service closures with the St Helens Hospital and the Hobart Private Hospital, which has put even further strain on our public hospitals [Bookmark: Phr17_O=169.5_D=3.3_C=0.85] . This has also  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=174.7_D=3.1_C=0.89] had impact on our shortages of midwives.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=179.6_D=5.6_C=0.92] Finally, there has been the impact of leadership  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=186.5_D=24.3_C=0.83] from this government for this industry. Labor is right with you, Mrs Pentland, when it comes to standing shoulder to shoulder and working towards an industry where midwives are supported so they can do their work, so they can support mothers and babies. That also extends to out care: for [Bookmark: Phr21_O=211.7_D=9.2_C=0.82]  lactation consultants, Child Health and Parenting Service (CHaPS) nurses and for all nurses who have that continuation of care.

 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=223.3_D=15.0_C=0.86] The statistics when it comes to mothers experiencing postnatal depression and anxiety is approximately one in five, which is huge - and that is just the women who [Bookmark: Phr23_O=239.8_D=20.2_C=0.83]  tell people about it. A lot of people suffer in silence and just hope it gets better. As a mum who did suffer from postnatal anxiety, it was the midwives who picked up on it, pulled me through, picked me back up when I could not do it anymore [Bookmark: Phr24_O=261.1_D=0.8_C=0.38] .

 [Bookmark: Phr25_O=264.2_D=6.6_C=0.87] Labor will be supporting your motion wholeheartedly when it comes to supporting our midwives  [Bookmark: Phr26_O=271.0_D=6.6_C=0.80] and the fantastic work they do for Tasmanian mothers and babies.

[6.21 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr27_O=287.1_D=17.6_C=0.86] Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I also thank the member for Bass for bringing this motion this evening and for bringing this to our attention. Thank you, also, for sharing your personal story and making this very real for us. Sometimes it is easy for us to be separate in here and lose touch with what is happening, and it is very real to hear the stories from people here today. Thank you for that. 

I want to begin by saying that the Greens will also be supporting this motion.  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=27.0_D=9.2_C=0.82] Having a baby and the whole prenatal, postnatal journey is this critical time of massive transition and change  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=36.7_D=20.9_C=0.90] on a personal level, in someone's life, in a woman's life, and also in terms of the whole family and the change that it goes through. Midwives are critical to that and the care that they provide is essential in helping provide for safety, helping smooth that transition, and helping families to adjust to the changes.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=58.6_D=21.1_C=0.77] We have long known that there are issues within maternity services in our state. The union, the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (ANMF) in particular, have been speaking about this for a long time and raising concerns. They have had concerns around staffing and safety within our hospitals and have called for action.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=81.2_D=7.6_C=0.79] I acknowledge what was shared by the minister earlier, and the encouraging  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=89.2_D=18.6_C=0.81] developments, programs and services and funding that she announced. It was particularly exciting to hear that midwifery training will be available in Tasmania again soon, as we know that can make a big difference to the availability of midwives within our state.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=110.5_D=12.9_C=0.87] On the one hand, we have the things that the minister shared that were great, and on the other hand we have the stories from people in the community and the unions that highlight the problems we have. It is important that we  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=124.2_D=9.4_C=0.88] do not lose focus on those problems. We know that the Health Department at the moment and the health system is undergoing  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=134.8_D=30.0_C=0.86] budget efficiencies, hiring freezes and cuts. It is a very difficult time, from a budgetary point of view, within the Health Department. That puts pressure on everyone, and that includes within our maternity services. 

I was looking at some of the media releases that the ANMF put out over the last six months, and there were frequent calls for more effort to be made and for more action to be taken on staffing - not just [Bookmark: Phr10_O=164.8_D=29.6_C=0.84]  staffing of midwives, but also staffing of ward aides and admin staff. They also are an important part of service provision within our health services. We need midwives. We need midwives being trained, retained and attracted to the state. However, we also need support staff who are there enabling midwives to do their job, freeing them up from admin so they are not having to answer hundreds of phone calls a shift, as is sometimes happening [Bookmark: Phr11_O=194.6_D=10.2_C=0.79] , not having to do lots of paperwork and admin that takes them away from being there for mothers and their babies.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=206.3_D=26.5_C=0.86] I want to note that there is definitely a lot happening in this space. We had the investigation of the Royal Hobart Hospital that happened last year. That was handed down in December with its 38 recommendations. That report highlighted that there was a discrepancy between the FTE allocation for wards in the maternity unit and the actual number of staff who were available [Bookmark: Phr13_O=233.8_D=4.7_C=0.91] . The Greens will continue to call for actions to be taken to address that discrepancy. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=239.4_D=7.2_C=0.94]  

The unions have ideas for doing that, and we would call on the government to continue to listen to the unions.  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=248.3_D=18.5_C=0.81] They are the ones who are connected with the midwives working on the ground. They know what the issues are and they have good ideas for things to be done there, including making sure that we are using agency midwives to fill vacancies in the short term, and that we are undertaking that recruitment work.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=269.2_D=27.5_C=0.84] I understand that the government have committed to implementing all of the 38 recommendations of that report, and that there is an implementation review committee in place. I have heard some concerns about whether that committee will be able to genuinely address the recommendations. The Greens call on the government to ensure that there is good faith, genuine action being taken [Bookmark: Phr17_O=297.5_D=3.4_C=0.72] , and real listening to midwives and to the report  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=301.3_D=2.3_C=0.81] and to unions in this space.

We have the closure of St Helen's Private Hospital that has been announced coming up in August, and we know the extra pressure that is going to place on our maternity services in Hobart. That highlights the importance of us ensuring that public services are resourced and funded and adequate to meet the needs of Tasmanians. 

We know that private hospitals provide a great service and that they provide choice for Tasmanians, but we cannot rely on them. Otherwise, we end up in a situation like we have here, with St Helen's Private Hospital closing their maternity services and putting pressure on. We continue to call on the government to ensure that public services are funded to the level needed to meet the needs of all Tasmanians.

In terms of the specifics of the motion - as I said, the Greens will be supporting this - I was interested in clause 4, which says the House:

Commits to making maternal health a political priority in 2025, ensuring every Tasmanian mother and baby, regardless of location, receives safe, high-quality care.

I would like to expand that beyond just being a political priority, because I believe when we make things a political issue, it can become a back and forth between parties. The Greens would like to see this being something that is a priority financially, structurally and for the community. It needs to go beyond being a political priority to something that is prioritised broadly across services and across the community. We all need to recognise the importance of maternal health and have that commitment to ensuring safe, high-quality care.

Thank you again to the member for Bass for this motion. As I have said, we will be supporting it.

[6.29 p.m.]
Ms OGILVIE (Clark - Minister for Innovation, Science, and the Digital Economy) - Mrs Pentland, your strength and the power of what you have said today is phenomenal and remarkable. I want to go on the record and say that, because I have walked your path. It happened to me. I want to say, by way of deep empathy, that it is possible to walk through it, and people will walk with you on that journey. That is what I have found.

Coming into this place and telling your story is really hard to do. I have not been as brave as you and have never told my whole story, but I want to just acknowledge that you did that. It is really quite amazing.

I will also share a little more of an insight into my situation. My daughter Violet lived for seven days. It was the most profound week of my life. I very much felt, as I was going through that and my family were going through that, that you make a choice to get up and go forward. I feel that is what you have done here, so it is really fantastic that you have done that.

I want to say - Mr Ferguson had better not leave, because I was going to say something nice about him. This was some time ago, before many of you were here or in this Chamber. When it happened to me, I went on a bit of a mission too. My mission was to try and resolve the problem we had with end-of-life decision-making and the fact that it did not have a legislative basis. I spent probably a decade working on that, and Mr Ferguson was incredibly helpful with that.

Ultimately, the Liberal Party, which I was not a part of at the time, did pass that legislation. I look at that and go, 'I did that. I did that because of what happened to me.' It has made things better for other people going through those circumstances. I will support you personally and as much as I can on your journey.

It is really instructive that we have so many women in the Chamber here, looking, watching and hoping that we can find a way forward together. The ability to bring people together across the Chamber for issues that really matter is like the secret magic of politics, and I think you have it. Well done.

[6.32 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Like others, I want to start by thanking the member for Bass, Mrs Pentland, and also thanking the minister, Ms Ogilvie, for sharing your very deeply personal story. I knew a little bit about that, but not a lot, and it is really meaningful.

I believe personal experiences can be a real catalyst in politics and there has been remarkable political change achieved at both state and federal levels because of somebody's personal experience. I think it is incredible that you are taking that on as your mission, as you said, for 2025. I commend you for it and I will be another very loud voice for midwives alongside you. To share your personal experience like that is not only brave, it is really generous to do that as a human. I commend you and I thank you.

As the minister, Mrs Petrusma, said, I feel incredibly honoured and privileged to be chairing a committee that we have at the moment in the lower House - the committee into reproductive, maternal and paediatric health. That committee has almost wound up its public hearing phase and we are moving to report writing. What we have heard from individual midwives, from individual women and families going through maternal services in Tasmania and from organisations has been profound and really meaningful evidence that will, I am confident, provide a very robust report to the minister and to the government with strong recommendations around that evidence base that we have gathered as a committee and the improvements that can be made to the maternity services, in particular, and to reproductive and paediatric services.

Midwives are the backbone of our health system. I have several friends who are midwives but many of them are leaving the profession and they are leaving because of the pressure they are working under. I recognise that is a problem around the country and the world. Workforce recruitment in nursing and midwifery is at an all-time crisis but we can make Tasmania the most attractive place for midwives to want to come and work in our public health system. I am confident we can do that as a parliament and as a state. It is really important that things like vacancy control, the recruitment freeze that was announced a little while ago, do not apply to midwives because we know how tough they are doing it. 

When you hear from women who have given birth, you hear overwhelmingly positive stories, like the one shared by you, Mrs Pentland, about the care, love and nurture that they received from those midwives. However, when you talk to those midwives, they tell you the personal toll it takes, how hard it is to work double shifts, how difficult it is not to have babies counted in the patient ratio. I recognise Birthrate Plus is one formula to do that but the way it has been described to me is that it is a formulaic form that attributes a percentage of a patient FTE, if you like, to that staffing decision. I recognise that the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (ANMF) has been raising many of these issues for a very long time. I commend them for the advocacy and the work that they have done.

I also want to say something really positive about the minister, Mrs Petrusma. We are on different sides of politics but we do have a female Health minister, a former nurse, who sat on that committee with me until the day before she became Health minister and, like I said in the media, I have high expectations and I will hold you to account but I believe that that is meaningful. I do not want to get too political here, but with very few exceptions, there are almost no men in the Chamber tonight. I recognise you are in the chair, Deputy Speaker. It is not a criticism of anyone individually. I know there is a football stadium to be talked about in this state right now, but this is women in here doing this work. Women's health is incredibly important.

Last week, when the maternal health committee not only had the minister at the table, but also the head of Healthscope and the head of Calvary, the Public Accounts Committee was happening at the same time. The Public Accounts Committee does incredibly important work and they were discussing the football stadium. There were no eyes on the maternal health committee that day. There was no media reporting of what happened in the committee that day and it was not any ordinary day not that any day has been ordinary on that committee. Every day has been extraordinary but we had senior people at the table: the minister, the national head of Healthscope who runs the Hobart Private Hospital, and the head of Calvary, who as we know, is going to be taking on a lot of private system births. There were no eyes on that committee that day.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - A cameraman walked into our room.

Ms HADDAD - Yes, thank you, Deputy Speaker. The Deputy Speaker has just reminded me that a cameraman did walk in and I thought, great, they are going to cover something about our committee. He looked a bit confused by the attendees at the table and realised he was looking for the committee next door. He was looking for Public Accounts.

As I said, the work the Public Accounts Committee does is important, but it is a sign that there are hardly any men in the Chamber tonight. I commend those who are. Many of the men in the Chamber are dads and would also have had a personal experience of midwifery care. They would know how important that is for their female partners, their loved ones and themselves. We have heard from dads on the committee as well about how profound their experiences with midwives have been in seeing their little ones get born.

That is probably a little bit of a snarky way for me to go, but I just want to highlight the fact that we do a lot more in this place than talk about the economy and infrastructure. Women's health matters. We have a majority female Labor caucus in the federal parliament that has seen the biggest investment in women's health in Australia's history. I do not think that would have happened if there were not more women at the table.

I believe Mrs Petrusma is true to her word when we heard at the committee that some of the things raised in those submissions are already underway in her department. She is looking at that review into maternity services at the Royal, which came about through a different process. She is already in negotiations with UTAS about bringing back midwifery training, which we have heard a lot about on the committee, and the new midwifery workforce strategy. Those things are meaningful, but do not worry: you will be getting a raft of more recommendations from our committee.

Healthscope's decision was a massive blow to women in Tasmania, including women who are pregnant right now who have found out they will not be giving birth at Hobart Private, where they thought they would. I recognise there has been a federal government investment of $6 million to upgrade facilities at the Royal and at Calvary, and some money for St Johns Park. That is a welcome commitment, and Calvary assured the committee last week that they are capable of taking on that large number of private births. They see about 300 a year while Healthscope sees about 600, so it is a big jump for them, but they told the committee they would be able to do that.
It also provides the opportunity for the government and the parliament to think a bit differently around maternity services. One of the things we have heard really strongly from midwives, from health professionals and from mothers is the importance of privately practising midwives and the care they provide. There are very few of them working in Tassie, but the committee was fortunate to tour the Launceston Birth Centre, which is an amazing place. It is right across the road from the LGH. They have very strong connections into the LGH, and the obstetricians and midwives who work there. It is a very safe way to birth. The committee heard on Friday that the minister is looking at potentially providing publicly funded home births. At the moment, we are the only state that does not have that.

While the Healthscope decision was a big blow, it has come at a time when there are opportunities for us to think outside the square and consider the best way to provide maternal health services in Tasmania. Thanks for the opportunity to speak a little bit on that motion today and thanks again to Mrs Pentland for bringing on this important issue.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr Farrell, the member for Lyons. You have about 90 seconds.

[6.40 p.m.]
Mr FARRELL (Lyons) - Ninety seconds - I will be very quick then. Thank you, Mrs Pentland, for bringing this motion to the House. I did not want to jump and speak when there were people with deep experience related to the issue, but I wanted to share why this is important to me. As a father, I have lived experience in what you speak about. I echo the sentiment that organisations such as Beyond the Rainbow need to be well supported to provide the services they provide.

Speaking about midwives, particularly after the birth of my first child, I would have had absolutely no hope of supporting the mother of my children at that time without the incredible support of the midwives we had access to in the hospital, and then similarly with the second and third child. They go through a lot. There is a lot of stress in that work. It is a very difficult process for people to train up to it and I have enormous respect for the work they do. Thank you very much for bringing this motion. I wanted to add a little bit of something from a father's perspective about how important midwives are.

Motion agreed to.


 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=12.1_D=13.1_C=0.70] MOTION

Events Sector

[6.42 p.m.]
Mr FAIRS (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, a vote will be required. I move - 

That the House -

Notes:

the important contribution of our events sector in driving economic growth, tourism and jobs in every region of the State; 

(b)	that events and the “gig economy” are a trigger for visitors to travel to Tasmania and provide on average a 5:1 return on investment; and 

(c)	that during 2023-24 financial year more than 112,000 visitors travelled to Tasmania to attend an event supported by Events Tasmania and that visitors to events and festivals have a higher yield than regular visitors. 

(2)	Back the Tasmanian Government’s investment in our critical events sector and provide ongoing support to ensure a balanced events portfolio across seasons and regions to support our tourism and hospitality sectors, drive economic growth and continued job prosperity.

I am pleased to bring this motion to the House today to highlight the important contribution of our events sector in driving economic growth, tourism and jobs in every region of our wonderful state. The Tasmanian government has always been a strong supporter of the events sector, providing funding to attract, retain and grow events. 

We know events and the gig economy are incredibly important to Tasmania's visitor economy. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=54.4_D=5.0_C=0.76]  Since 2015, events have attracted more than 500,000 visitors to Tasmania. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=60.8_D=29.3_C=0.82]  Not only are they a trigger for visitors to travel to Tassie, they are also a significant boost to the tourism and hospitality sectors in every corner of our state. They create employment and opportunities to engage with Tasmanian businesses. During the 2023-24 financial year, more than 112,000 visitors travelled to Tasmania to attend events supported by Events Tasmania.  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=90.9_D=14.9_C=0.85] This is an increase of almost 15,000 visitors from 2022-23. This visitation generated more than 550,000 bed nights and an economic impact of more than $300 million. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=106.6_D=15.2_C=0.90]  The calculated return on investment for every dollar invested by Events Tasmania for events in the 2023-24 year was five to one. That means for every dollar the government invested, $5 was returned to the Tasmanian economy.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=122.7_D=4.8_C=0.81] The average length of stay for visitors travelling for events is 8.6 days. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=128.3_D=30.0_C=0.82]  For events like the Australian Wooden Boat Festival and the Tasmanian Craft Fair, these stays are significantly longer, growing to 16 and 10 days respectively. We also know that visitors to events and festivals have a significantly higher yield than regular visitors, spending $360 per day, approximately $48 per day more than any other visitor. 

One in eight visitors have reported that Tasmania's reputation as a lively and authentic event scene had sparked their travel  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=158.5_D=27.1_C=0.74] experience. We know Dark Mofo is an iconic Tasmanian event that is recognised as a world-class winter festival. This festival drives significant interstate and international visitation to Tasmania during our off season. From 2013 to 2023, Dark Mofo attracted more than 300,000 unique visitors to Tasmania. Its return this year is anticipated to provide a significant economic boost,  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=186.5_D=3.1_C=0.75] reinforcing our status as a premier winter destination. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=190.5_D=19.6_C=0.85]  

The Tasmanian government is proud to have helped secure the future of the festival. We are investing $21.6 million to support the delivery of Dark Mofo through to 2027. This is just one part of our commitment to Tasmania's events sector, with $68 million over the next four years to support its ongoing success. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=211.0_D=26.2_C=0.80]  Supporting the event will consolidate Dark Mofo's position as Tasmania's premier winter festival and aims to attract an estimated 90,000 patrons from interstate and overseas over the three-year period, continue to engage local audiences, present provocative art that contributes to its brand reputation as a festival of international significance and deliver two significant regional Dark Mofo events per year.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=238.0_D=7.6_C=0.80] This new agreement includes $1 million to be spent annually on programming and support drawn from Tasmania cultural and business activity,  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=246.0_D=18.0_C=0.79] including collaborations with international artists and Tasmanian artists, and the hire and supply of Tasmanian event employment, project management, production equipment and infrastructure. This will further drive the direct economic contribution that the festival has for Tasmanian businesses and its staff.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=265.9_D=26.5_C=0.84] In addition to the star-pulling power of Dark Mofo, Tasmania has a wide range of offerings attracting people from across the country and the world. This includes motorsports, which Tasmanians love, including myself. More than 20,000 interstate and international visitors are expected to attend Supercars events in Tasmania over the next three years, providing substantial economic and social benefits to the state. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=293.1_D=9.5_C=0.62]  Other events include the Festival of Voices, which has drawn 30,000 people since 2005 and continues to draw musical talent from across the globe.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=304.0_D=0.9_C=0.85] I am sure most members took the opportunity over summer to enjoy at least one or two of the fantastic events on offer across the state. I know I certainly did. Throughout the months of December 2024 to March 2025, Events Tasmania supported 58 events. These events were expected to bring more than 31,000 visitors to Tasmania during the summer months. These events ranged across the state from the Taste of Summer in Hobart and the Cygnet Folk Festival to the sold-out Festivale in Launceston.

There can be no question of the government's commitment to supporting the event sector and its continued growth and development. Through Events Tasmania the government is delivering critical support to events thanks to the Major Event Partnerships Program and multiple grant programs, which include touring, championship and marketing grants.

More recently, the Minister for Sports and Events launched the $5 million Tasmanian Festival and Event Support Fund for events during the 2025 winter and shoulder seasons to attract and support more local events and festivals, driving visitation right around Tasmania. Events Tasmania also manages the government's commercial partnerships such as the Hawthorn Football Club and Tasmanian JackJumpers, which provide significant benefits to our state. 
We saw no greater example of this than on Saturday night at UTAS Stadium in my electorate of Bass, where some 15,000 fans turned out for the AFL battle under lights between the Hawks and the Giants in what turned out to be an amazing game, with the Hawks coming from behind to win. The hotels were full in Launceston, restaurants were full, and this was a great outcome for businesses and hospitality venues in the north. It is the same when the Supercars and Race Tasmania are on in the state as well.

The government's focus is to ensure a balanced events portfolio ensuring seasonal and regional balance, as well as a comprehensive range of event types. Importantly, the funding programs encourage events to take place in the winter and shoulder seasons to ensure balance in the Tasmanian events calendar. We know events are crucial to boosting the economy, particularly in the winter months, and the government always make this a priority.

Events Tasmania's programs aim to attract people to Tasmania, move Tasmanians and tourists around our great state and get people talking about Tasmania through their own circles of influence. As I have said, this government remains committed to the events sector, with $68 million over the next four years to support their ongoing success.

One of the ways we are supporting events is through the Major Event Partnerships Program, which provides funding to significant events that return substantial economic outcomes for the state. It aligns with Events Tasmania's strategic aims to attract people to Tasmania, move Tasmanians and tourists around Tasmania and get people talking about a great state through their own circles of influence. The program supports events that are a relatively even mix of sporting and cultural events that take place around the state, and addresses the ongoing aim of increasing events in the winter and shoulder season to ensure balance in the Tasmanian events calendar.

During the 2023-24 financial year, the Major Event Partnership Program provided almost $11 million to 45 separate events. The $5-million Tasmanian Festival and Event Support Fund is part of the comprehensive tourism and hospitality package to support the tourism, hospitality and event sectors over the next two years. This grant program opened in December 2024, seeking applications for events during the 2025 winter and shoulder seasons to attract and support more local events and festivals, driving visitation right around Tasmania. With a particular focus on the off season, this program will boost our regional economies and support our tourism and hospitality sectors during what can be a tough period.

By making grants available, we can secure more events and make Tassie the place to be all year round. The response to this fund has been strong, and we have already seen some recipients announced. Planning is well underway for events during this off season, including the inaugural Illuminate the North West, which will light up the coast with a new region-wide series of events celebrating its iconic sites and history. Illuminate the North West received $415,000 from the fund and will feature immersive light projections, bringing five iconic sites in Queenstown, Strahan, Wynyard, Penguin and King Island to life. The fund will also support a range of other diverse events including Bangor Music in the Vines, Strait Link Burnie 10, the Tasmanian Craft Fair, 10 Days on the Island and The Unconformity.

We are indeed spoilt for choice in Tasmania. There are so many great events happening right across our state. In recent months, we have no doubt witnessed firsthand the amazing work of volunteer and organiser teams who are bringing first class events and celebrations to all parts of Tasmania. This has included the Bicheno Food and Wine Festival in November. The government-announced funding of $70,000 to support the delivery of last year's event as well as the 2025 and 2026 events. It is just one of several events we are supporting on the east coast and across northern Tasmania.

We know driving visitation to our regions is important and it is great to see demand for regional festivals. The government has been pleased to announce our continued support for some of Tasmania's other much-loved events. This includes $1.285 million to support the iconic Festivale to deliver three events from 2025 to 2027, and $150,000 to support the delivery of Launceston's BeerFest to 2026. In addition, we have committed a total of $300,000 to deliver one round of the Australian Rally Championship in Tasmania each year from 2025 to 2027.

In the north-west, a total of $875,000 has been invested into the event sector in the last financial year, supporting a total of 18 events. Some of the events supported in the north-west include Burnie 10, Devonport Triathlon, TrailGraze and the recent Tasmanian Masters Games, to name a few, Deputy Speaker. What is great about the Tasmanian Masters Games in particular is it was spread out across multiple locations in the region, injecting into many towns for the flow-on effects to be felt across the entire region. Our pubs, hotels and tourism offerings all benefit because we know many of the participants will extend their stay pre or post event or even both. 

Through our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future, we committed $140,000 to the Tasmanian Masters Games as an election commitment because we know the significant impact on the region. Our government remains committed to supporting the event sector, as I know West by North West as the north-west local regional tourism organisation does. We will continue to seek a diverse range of event content that will encourage visitation across the entire state. It is safe to say the Tasmanian events calendar is looking strong for this year and beyond.

Tourism is just one of part of the event story. Events have a social and economic impact. They create excitement and entertainment, as well as employment, business, economic and social opportunities. Events drive our sense of place, garner pride and allow for our involvement in so many ways, from the arts and sports to business and food and beverage. Events have the power to mobilise people in meaningful ways and generate lasting, positive impacts on the quality of life of our community. There is also the broader economic impact provided by events which leave a legacy on infrastructure and skills. They create jobs across a wide variety of sectors, they have an intense impact on the regions and have a potential to support and bolster our great Tasmania brand.

Tasmania also has a strong business event sector which is well supported by the government. Business events bring in more than 51,000 visitors to Tasmania each year and close to $200 million in direct total spend for business event delegates visiting Tasmania. In addition to this, 28 per cent of these visitors bring family and friends to experience our great state. Why would they not? Delegates often extend their stay an average of 4.7 nights beyond the conference they are attending; 20 per cent of delegates who attended business events will disperse to regional destinations during their stay; 89 per cent of delegates intend to return to Tasmania within the next three years; association attendees spent $821 per day and corporations up to $1347 per delegate per day in Tasmania. The evidence is clear that events and business events play a critical role in driving not only visitation and economic growth but in social connection, experience and confidence among our wider hospitality and tourism sectors. I urge the House to support the motion and to back the government's continued investment in this sector which provides ongoing support to ensure a balanced events portfolio across seasons and regions to support our tourism and hospitality sectors, drive economic growth and continued job prosperity.

Deputy Speaker, I commend the motion to the House.

[6.52 p.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Deputy Speaker, absolutely everybody in this place can agree that events are incredibly important to Tasmania, and we have some fantastic events in this state. Some events are run by Events Tasmania - and Mr Fairs spoke of some of them - such as The Tasmanian Masters Games. They are absolutely tremendous. I am very proud that my dad is a champion in badminton for multiple years as a part of the Masters Games.

There is also the garlic festival at Koonya, down towards the Tasman. What a great event that is, which gets fantastic media coverage. There is Steamfest, up in Sheffield. Kentish really comes alive, and I am a proud sponsor of that event as well; ECHO, on the east coast; Lightwave, which happens down in Nubeena; and Beaker Street.

These are really great festivals that bring together our dark skies, the light, the aurora, -these fantastic phenomena that we have in Tasmania - things that are easily appreciated and accessed when it is a little bit darker later in the year in winter, which helps diversify our visitation into that off season and the shoulder season as well.

We have festivals such as the Unconformity, and what tremendous value that has brought to the west coast for part of the shoulder season. It has really highlighted the value of the arts for our regional communities, and why we have to see ongoing investment into sectors such as the arts, which is going to complement our events sector as well. Events investment alone cannot be put into a silo.

There are some events that have dropped off the radar in recent years - for example, Falls Festival. We know that Dark MOFO has been scaled back as well. These are some examples of where the government could be doing more, and where certainly the crossbench, and I am sure the Labor Party, want to be able to hold this government to account and have a say where there is room for improvement.

This motion also talks about the gig economy. I am certain that is more about a festival gig, but I want to talk about the other kind of 'gig' in the digital age. I spoke about that a little this morning during the matter of public importance when talking about the Cygnet Folk Festival. Here we had a fantastic event where Tasmanian businesses were losing money. They could not take EFTPOS cards because, with the number of people there, the digital connectivity went down. It was the same thing at the garlic festival - I know Ms Burnet, the member for Clark, had firsthand experience - where businesses could not accept EFTPOS payment and people there did not have cash.

Ms Butler - And the Campbell Town Show.

Ms BADGER - The Campbell Town Show. We all know Agfest is a bit notorious. We have to be investing in other aspects to raise our events up to the best possible standard for 2025.

One of the key attractions that people come to Tasmania for - yes, they come here for events, but they also come here to be immersed in nature. Nature is part of the great Tasmanian brand that Mr Fairs spoke about. When we have government policies that are intent on destroying the very thing that people are coming here to see, it is heart wrenching that some organisers of events have to make a decision to no longer go ahead with those events, such as the Panama Festival. Organisers there have announced that they will not be running their absolutely celebrated music festival in 2026 because they are concerned that forests surrounding that festival site have been flagged for logging, and they are now putting their efforts into campaigning to protecting that forest instead of running the event. Where is the certainty here coming from the government? People are going there to be immersed in nature as well as that festival-based event.

The motion has some statistics. During the 2023-2024 financial year, more than 112,000 visitors travelled to Tasmania to attend events supported by Events Tasmania. That is a very impressive statistic. What is also an impressive statistic is that in the year ending September 2024, 65 per cent of all visitors to Tasmania - that is 852,000 people - took part in the outdoors, in nature. Around 40 per cent of all visitors to this state visited our national parks. Where is the investment equally into those, which people equally come here to see? We do not celebrate them enough. The Greens certainly do, and we would like to see more of that from the other side of the House.

The motion calls for us to back investment into exclusively the events sector. We all want to see investment into events, but it is everything else around it that has to be taken into consideration as well. There are so many other ventures that the government could also be investing in when we are trying to get visitors to come to this state, particularly in the shoulder and the offseason, to spread that economic dollar the whole year round so the people who are running tourism businesses can have that bit more certainty for 12 months of the year. Investing in things such as protecting our dark skies. The communities are doing it, this Liberal government is not. Bird tourism brings an awful lot of money into the economy in other states. We need to be doing a lot more in Tasmania. We could be celebrating our tall trees, not cutting down the forests around the Panama Festival.

I have one amendment to propose to this motion and that is because, yes, we all support unanimously in this place investment into events, of course we do, but that is not just investment from the Tasmanian Government, we also want investment from the federal government. We also want large investment from the private sector as well. Be it exclusively this Tasmanian government, the Liberal government, it is not really restrained in the motion as it is currently written but certainly, the Greens and I expect the crossbench and the Labor Party need to actually be able to scrutinise all events as they come up and where that funding is actually going to. By putting through this motion as it currently is, we do not just want to unanimously support everything that this Tasmanian Government is investing into events.

Deputy Speaker, I move that the motion be amended by omitting from clause 2, the Tasmanian government, which means that the new clause and I am now speaking to the amendment very quickly will read: 'back investment into our critical events sector and provide ongoing support to ensure balanced events portfolio across seasons and regions to support our tourism and hospitality sectors, drive economic growth and continue job prosperity.'

It does not substantially change the principle of the motion that Mr Fairs has brought on, because I have no doubt that absolutely everybody in this place supports that principle.

Recognition of Visitors

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Members, I welcome His Honour, Chief Justice Shanahan, and Mrs Deanna Shanahan to the Chamber. Welcome.

Members - Hear, hear.
———————————————————
[7.04 p.m.]
Mr FARRELL (Lyons) - Deputy Speaker, I thank the member for Bass, Mr Fairs, for bringing this motion to the House. We had a look at the amendment and we are happy to support the amendment that has been put, for slightly different reasoning to the member for Lyons. The motion as it was presented, starts well. It starts by celebrating the amazing contribution that this state receives and this state economy receives from tourism and hospitality and events that happen here.

Then, in the second clause of that motion, it seeks to attribute that to the Tasmanian government's investment. We all know that investment in hospitality, tourism, events sectors from this state comes from a whole range of sources and, as such, we are happy with the amendment to back investment broadly rather than just that of the Tasmanian government.

It is obvious that the biggest supporters of the tourism and hospitality industry in this parliament is the Tasmanian Labor Party and I think, without doubt, we are happy to support a motion that celebrates this industry and the amazing work that they do and the amazing contribution they make to this state. What I would say, though, is that a government that is devoid of ideas throws money at problems, whereas a government with vision seeks to solve them. I will let the House consider what type of government they might think we have.

On 24 October last year, the Premier announced what he called a comprehensive tourism and hospitality package with a suite of initiatives to try to make up for the enormous cost to the industry of the Spirits debacle, something that came about through his government's mismanagement of critical infrastructure projects for this state. This comprehensive package included subsidies for travel on the Spirits, increases to the day sailings of the Spirits, subsidies for additional flights to Tasmania, grants for businesses to prepare for Spirits IV and V, a new voucher scheme and some more grants to attract events.

Only one of those initiatives is not brainlessly throwing money at the problem and not only brainlessly throwing money at the problem, as this House knows, any expenditure like this by this government is debt-funded because they have driven the Budget into the ground and they do not have the money to support these initiatives. Brainlessly throwing debt-funded cash at the problem seems to be most of what was in this suite of initiatives. However, there was one initiative that was not along these lines and that was the increased day sailings for the Spirits, and to give credit, that is a fantastic idea, absolutely phenomenal idea and something that will really support the tourism and hospitality industry and therefore the economy generally.

I give credit to the person who came up with that idea. It was first published on 22 August 2024, two months and two days before the Premier announced it, by Dean Winter, the Leader of the Tasmanian Labor Party. It was published on our website as a policy that would help support the tourism industry in this state and then it was picked up by the government and they gladly took it as their own. It is nice to know that you are following along with what the Labor Party is doing and that you are aware of the policies we have in place, that we will use to fix the mess that you have created.

To be fair to the government, they came back to the table and, on 16 March this year, announced another policy to benefit the hospitality, tourism and events industry: a major, very overdue overhaul of Tasmania's liquor licencing. They are going to cut the red tape, modernise outdated rules and create opportunity for small business. Those lines are not taken from the government's policy. They are taken, again credited to Dean Winter, the Leader of the Tasmanian Labor Party, published on 13 February 2025. At least in this case, your army of spin doctors have become more efficient, only taking a month this time to run our policies through ChatGPT to make it look like your own.

The Premier said this morning that he could quite easily recite Labor's policy. I am not surprised to hear that, given how much time he clearly spends looking for ideas in our policies. I am also not surprised to hear the continual request from the government for Labor to produce an alternative budget. I think this might be so that they can get some ideas for how to fix the budget mess that they have created.

These government policies are an attempt to make up for the Spirits debacle, again, a problem that has been created by this government. We know that the estimated cost to the industry of the delays of getting Spirits IV and V operational is about $500 million a year. The government's own policies - the ones that are the government's own - were announced half-a-year ago and as yet there is very little to show for it. Not only have they not supported the industry, this government has cost the industry in the order of $250 million through their own stuff-ups.

Just giving money away because they have no ideas about how they can make meaningful reform to actually support tourism and hospitality businesses, is not a good place for the government and that seems to be the only tool they have in their basket to try to help the industry. I want to help them out by giving them some more ideas of some great policies that they could put in place in order to truly help this industry:

Number one, reducing red tape - which they love - by working with city councils to cut unnecessary permits and costs for late night venues, outdoor dining and festivals struggling to find sustainable business models. Sounds like a great idea?

Creating 24-hour economy zones to streamline land use approvals and tailor trading regulations to encourage business growth and activity after hours.

Supporting live music and arts venues by offering liquor licence fee rebates for venues that promote live entertainment.

Introducing protections for existing venues so that they can operate freely.

Focusing on night-time workers to prioritise the safety, security and wellbeing for workers that our night-time economy relies on such as cleaners, hospitality staff, security guards, transport workers and emergency services.

Establishing live music and cultural precincts to protect venues from noise complaints.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=13.2_D=29.4_C=0.82] Streamlining permits for festivals and events with a one-stop-shop approach for approvals. expanding affordable.

Late-night transport options in collaboration with public and private providers.

Encouraging family-friendly and non-alcoholic options such as Twilight markets, outdoor cinemas and expanded non-alcoholic drink offerings, and supporting partnerships between arts organisations and licensed venues with co-funding for events that combine liquor service with live performance gallery exhibitions  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=42.7_D=25.2_C=0.83] or community arts. 

There is a suite of initiatives that will truly support the tourism and hospitality sector, and you can take as many of those as you like. If you have not heard what I have said, you can go to the Labor Party website, have a look at our policy for the night-time economy and you can copy and paste freely from there. This is what this Labor government will be doing  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=68.8_D=6.6_C=0.75] to fix the industry, because you have cost it with your stuff-up with the Spirits.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=77.1_D=24.0_C=0.84] Unlike the government, we have consulted widely with the industry and we understand what meaningful change looks like. It is not just a debt-funded cash splash, because you have driven the budget into the ground. 

The Premier and the government love to quote the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. We hear it pretty much every day, so I will do the same. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=101.9_D=13.3_C=0.80]  In response to the Tasmanian government's handling of the Spirit debacle:

This is a dark day for Tasmania. The economic costs of the government's mismanagement of the new Spirits  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=115.7_D=17.0_C=0.90] will be felt by businesses and taxpayers for years to come. Our brand has been damaged and it has impacted on business confidence… it will be very difficult to trust this government again. 

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=134.1_D=18.8_C=0.87] There are very significant cultural and leadership issues in the Tasmanian government. This government is no friend to tourism and hospitality, it is no friend to the events sector and it is no friend to business. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=154.7_D=8.3_C=0.90]  A government with no ideas throws money at problems. A government with vision solves them.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=164.2_D=7.8_C=0.88] We agree with the motion as amended - that the event sector is hugely important and makes a significant contribution to the Tasmanian economy.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=172.6_D=14.6_C=0.88] We will continue to acknowledge and support tourism, hospitality and events, and unlike this government, we will actually put together sensible, meaningful policy to solve the problems that this government has created.

[7.15 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, we have just heard a slavishly read out speech, undoubtedly prepared in the Leader of the Opposition's office. That is why there were such glowing references to the Leader of the Opposition.

Ms Badger - Touched a nerve did he? 

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ABETZ - Otherwise one would have to wonder why the Labor Party would seek to be in lockstep with the Greens on this issue. Yet again we see it, and the Tasmanian people and the Australian people ought to be under no illusion that this is what they do whenever they can.

Ms BADGER - Deputy Speaker, Standing Order 142, relevance. We are talking on the amendment to the motion which is very specifically about Tasmanian government funding to the events sector. It has nothing to do with what the leader of government business is currently talking about. 

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=234.1_D=29.0_C=0.71] DEPUTY SPEAKER - As the Speaker pointed out earlier, because of the limited time constraints in private members' time, we allow the amendment and the substantive motion to be debated at the same time.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=266.6_D=25.7_C=0.78] Mr ABETZ - It is very interesting to see that the Greens do not want the Tasmanian people to know that Labor is backing them in, nor does Labor want them to know that the Greens are backing them. They are ashamed of each other, yet they want to cooperate and form government. What a mean-spirited amendment, to deny the Tasmanian government's role in relation to events.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=295.0_D=10.0_C=0.80] Mr Farrell, have you ever counted on your side? Ten. There are 14 on our side, so do your maths and learn the difference. You can throw whatever you like at this government, but the people of Tasmania voted for more Liberal members of this Parliament -

Mr Farrell - Not enough.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr Farrell, you were heard in silence.

Mr ABETZ - I ask Mr Farrell which of this brainless funding he would pull. I dare him and the Labor Party to go to any one of these events and the community organisations, usually volunteers, who run these events, and say this was brainless funding. I dare Mr Farrell to say that. Go around your electorate of Lyons. Go to Bicheno, go to the Tasman Peninsula, go up into your own town of New Norfolk and say, 'This was brainless expenditure which should never have been applied.' I dare you to; I am sure you will not. For once, we have the member for Lyons silent, as he should be, in shame. The member for Lyons is silent, as he ought to be.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Please do not incite interjections.

Mr ABETZ - The member for Lyons - and sure, he is newish in this place - thought that extra day sailings was a wonderful initiative that the Leader of the Opposition thought of in August 2024. Can I tell the member that extra day sailings have been occurring for year upon year depending on the market demand during particular times of the year. This is not a new thing. For Mr Winter to say, 'Look at this new initiative; this is a Labor initiative,' all he is doing is parroting that which has occurred for the last year upon year.

Nothing new there, nothing new whatsoever, but unfortunately when you are given speaker's notes from the Leader of the Opposition's office to try to bolster the flagging Leader of the Opposition, you unwittingly repeat some of these nonsenses. I am sure Mr Farrell will soon learn to fact-check the speaking notes that emanate from the Leader of the Opposition.
In relation to this amendment as well, do I go to the Treasurer and say that Labor and the Greens do not want Tasmanian government investment in events? It is, in fact, the first savings measure I think I have ever heard emanating from the Greens. They clearly do not want Tasmanian government investment in events. Can I tell you, we as a government do want investment, because we know that for roughly every $1 we spend, there is a $5 return.

It is a five-to-one return; it is a great return. It is a worthwhile return and it ensures that cultural and other events can occur right around our state, not only here in the city of Hobart, but as I said before, in Bicheno and elsewhere, right around the state. What I would say to the House is if you do not want Tasmanian government investment in events, say so, and ask the Treasurer to remove that from the forthcoming budget.
I will seek to tell the Treasurer that that would be a brainless move, to use the word of the member for Lyons, because getting a 5-to-1 return on investment is a pretty good result, and to so demean it and say that such an investment is brainless is indicative of the mental activity that is occurring in the honourable member's head -

Ms Butler - You have not talked about the boats. 

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Ms Butler, it is nearly the end of the day.

Mr ABETZ - and the other member for Lyons interjects and says I have not talked about the boats.

Ms Butler - No, you have not.

Mr ABETZ - I am sorry. You know, if you were not so busy interjecting and listened a little bit, you would know that I actually did talk about TT-Line and the extra day sailings. Oops, you did not listen, did you? I will not take up more time because we want to get onto the Committee stage of the Greens' private members' bill, but the government opposes this mean-spirited and, frankly - I will use the term again - brainless amendment, which seeks to either remove Tasmanian government funding from these events or demean the spending we undertake. We have the capacity in the budget to assist especially the many local regional community events that are part and parcel of the social life of the people of Tasmania. We will continue to fund them despite the view of the Greens and the Labor Party which, unfortunately, is in lockstep in their opposition to our events and other festivals we have around this state.

DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Street) - The question is -

CUSTODIAL INSPECTOR AMENDMENT (PROTECTION FROM REPRISAL) BILL 2025 (No. 9)

In Committee

Clauses 1 to 5 agreed to.

Clause 6-
Section 15 amended (Inspection report)
[7.31 a.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Deputy Chair, I would like to move an amendment to clause 6. I move -

Page 4, after paragraph (d)

Insert the following paragraph -
( )	omitting from subsection (6)(a) "30-day" and substituting "7-day"; and

What a spectacle we had in here this afternoon. A disgraceful spectacle. This amendment is an important part of this bill, making it stronger. 

Member interjecting.

Ms ROSOL - Sorry, are you talking to me? What do you want to say?

A member - There were four of your speakers.

Ms ROSOL - It was a spectacle. It was shameful -
Members interjecting.

A member - You do not like democracy, you do not like when people speak?

DEPUTY CHAIR - Order.

Ms ROSOL - This is a simple piece of legislation.

A member - No need to be rude. Come on.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Ms Rosol, please speak through the Chair.

Ms ROSOL - If we are going to speak about rudeness - 

Ms Ogilvie - Come on, people are allowed to speak in this House. It is what we do.

Ms ROSOL - Chair, if we are going to speak about rudeness, we need to speak about what happened in here this afternoon.

DEPUTY CHAIR (Ms Beswick) - Ms Rosol, you will speak through the Chair.

Ms Ogilvie - People are allowed to speak in this House. It is what we do.

DEPUTY CHAIR - Minister Ogilvie.

Ms ROSOL - Deputy Chair, if we are going to speak about rudeness, we need to speak about what happened in here this afternoon. This is a simple piece of legislation to amend the Custodial Inspector Act so that vulnerable people who have experienced things they should not experience in our corrections facilities have protections if they choose to go and share those experiences with the Custodial Inspector. At the moment, they have no legal protections. They can go and speak to the Custodial Inspector, but there is no protection for them from reprisal. 

This amendment is an amendment in response to a recommendation from the Custodial Inspector. It is an amendment that echoes other legislation that this government has legislated itself. We did not go and create the wording for this; we looked at already existing legislation and put that legislation into this amendment. This amendment is about caring for people, and what we saw on display in here this afternoon was total heartlessness, a refusal to care for the people.

Ms OGILVIE - Chair, Point of order -

Dr Woodruff - What is the point of order? What is it?

DEPUTY CHAIR - I will hear the minister.

Ms Ogilvie - May I speak?

Dr Woodruff - No. There is no space for you to speak.

Mr Behrakis- It is not up to you.
Ms OGILVIE - My point of order is this:

DEPUTY CHAIR - What number?

Ms OGILVIE - I was very happy to discuss -

Dr Woodruff - For clarification, what is the point of order? I did not think anyone could just get up and speak.

DEPUTY CHAIR - What order number, please?

Ms OGILVIE - Standing Order 145, in relation to saying nasty things about other members of the House.

Ms Rosol - I am sorry. I cannot believe what I sat through earlier this afternoon.

Dr Woodruff - A spectacle. Are you kidding? Sit down and pay the respect to the member who is speaking to the bill. Sit down.

Ms OGILVIE - I have not made my point of order.

Dr Woodruff - I find your behaviour offensive.

Ms OGILVIE - Oh, well.

DEPUTY CHAIR - Dr Woodruff, please let the minister -

Ms OGILVIE - May I make a point of order?

DEPUTY CHAIR - Yes please.

Ms Rosol - What number, though? The minister has not clarified, because 145 is not correct, as far as I know.

Dr Woodruff - Well?

DEPUTY CHAIR - Are you asking about personal offence?

Ms OGILVIE - The point of order I wish to make is in relation to the process by which we are going to go through these amendments. We are on amendment number six. We put through the amendments prior to that, and what I would like to -

Dr Woodruff - Deputy Chair, I really object to this. This is not a valid point of order, and I do not know why the minister is taking up time in our private members' time on a matter that is not a point of order. I would like your clarification on this, please. It is another spectacle.

Ms Ogilvie - Excuse me. Could you just stop being rude?

Dr Woodruff - Pot calling the kettle black, minister.

DEPUTY CHAIR - I will draw all members of the House to the relevancy of the clause we are debating this moment. We are debating clause 5.

Ms Rosol - Clause 6.

DEPUTY CHAIR - An amendment to clause 6. Can we just?

Ms ROSOL - Thank you, Deputy Chair. This clause 6 amends section 15 of the principal act to alter the timeframe for tabling, from not before 30 days after the report has been provided to the minister, to not before seven days. Our bill missed a reference to a 30-day period in section 15(6)(a), and this amendment corrects that omission by inserting a new paragraph to substitute this reference to a 30-day period.

This is not a controversial amendment. This gives the minister seven days to look at the report before it is tabled in this House. The Custodial Inspector would table the report, the minister has seven days to look at it, and then has time to review it and decide how they will respond to it. This is not a controversial amendment. This is just in line with recommendations from the Custodial Inspector to make our system fairer and to protect people.

Ms OGILVIE - In relation to this amendment, by convention, there is a mix of practices to whether independent statutory officers provide their reports to the responsible minister so, it is something worthy of discussion. I will put on the record that I am very disappointed with the tone from the other side of the Chamber in relation to what is a serious matter. I can assure the members of the Greens that we have taken this very seriously, and I have staff members from the government here to advise and I am really disappointed in the way you have approached this. This is democracy in action. People are entitled to speak in this House and I will always stand up for my colleagues when they want to speak.

In relation to this amendment, for example, the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner provides reports to the minister for tabling. In such previous provisions, the minister has no power to edit or withhold the report and must lay the report on the table within the specified time frame as soon as practicable after 30 calendar days, as in this case. The 30-day timeframe is to ensure the responsible minister can inquire into matters raised and, I can assure you, that is important to do that, and be advised by the department of issues - we saw the departmental staff here today, we take it very seriously - such as which recommendations to accept and be able to brief the parliament and colleagues when the report is tabled.

I object to the way you are attempting to position the amendments that you have brought in to change, particularly the ones where you have made mistakes in your own bill that we were being supportive of you coming in to fix and the tone with which you are attaching to - I can hear you coughing there, Rosalie.

Dr Woodruff - I cannot cough in the Chamber?

Ms OGILVIE - Remember when you ticked me off about coughing over there? 

DEPUTY CHAIR - Minister.

Ms OGILVIE - I am trying to assist you with your amendment and that is our position. That is section 6, if you would like to go through the rest of the clauses, we can be here and do that or we could just move forward with civility, where I am actually trying to assist you.

Ms ROSOL - I dislike being lectured to when I sat for one-and-a-half hours with minister after minister after minister after member calling me a hypocrite and telling me that I was incompetent.

Ms Ogilvie - I did not say that either.

Ms ROSOL - I did not jump up and take offence.

Ms Ogilvie - I did not say any of those things.

Ms ROSOL - I did not get up and complain, I did not bleat, and here -

Members interjecting.

 [Bookmark: _Hlk194517561] DEPUTY CHAIR - Please stop it with the banter.

Ms ROSOL - and here I am, calling out the manner with which this was debated previously, which was despicable and shameful - calling out the manner and I am being called out on that. The Custodial Inspector has made their recommendation about what should be amended within this bill and this amendment aligns with that and it aligns with the rest of the bill as written and tabled by us. We made a mistake, we own that mistake, and we are here to fix that with this amendment.

Ms BUTLER - We support the amendment put forward by the Greens in relation to the Custodial Inspector Amendment (Protection from Reprisal) Bill 2025. This is a typo; that is what this amendment is about. We support the bill and we understand that it is a typo and the reason for the typo has been explained to us, so we support this amendment.

Amendment agreed to.

Clause 6, as amended, agreed to.

Clauses 7 to 9 agreed to.

Clause 10 -
Section 34 amended (Protection for provision of information)

Ms ROSOL - Thank you, Chair. I move the following amendment -

Page 6, Leave out "volution"

Insert instead "volition"

This amendment corrects a typo in clause 10. For interest, volution means a rolling or revolving motion or a single turn of a spiral or coil, which is not the intended word for this clause.

Mr Ellis - It is the root word of 'revolution'.

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, in relation to the question asked by Mr Garland today. Mr Garland has already been advised that he will not be provided with an answer today, hopefully tomorrow. 

In relation to another question asked by Mr Garland yesterday, he has been provided with a full answer. Time will not allow me to read the whole lot into the Hansard, and by agreement what I would seek to do in those circumstances is table the answer. Although it is a marked up copy with some ticks, that might be the best way, and I thank you for your guidance in relation to that.

The SPEAKER - As a minister, you do not need to seek leave to table the document. Just table the answer.

Mr ABETZ - Then, Mrs Beswick asked a question of the Minister for Infrastructure in relation to some roadworks in her electorate. The answer that I have been provided by the Minister for Infrastructure is that, while the Department of State Growth is not aware of any major potholes logged in the maintenance system that have not already been rectified in this area, this will be checked and confirmed with the government's maintenance contractor. The department is also happy to investigate further if the exact location can be confirmed and/or a photo can be provided.

The SPEAKER - I think the question that she actually asked was about penalties, but the minister may not have understood that to be the case. I might leave that one with you.

Mr ABETZ - There is some more detail that I will provide to Mrs Beswick, but penalties are not commented on.

The SPEAKER - Do you have an answer to Mrs Petrusma's question as well?

Mr ABETZ - No, I do not.

The SPEAKER - That will be deferred till tomorrow then as well? Thank you.


Online Access Centres

[7.46 p.m.]
Ms BUTLER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, tonight, I want to talk about online access centres. Over many years I have consistently been coming to this Chamber and talking about the importance of our online access centre network. This has now been a nine-year campaign working with online access centres from around Tasmania to make sure that this government continues to fund online access centres.

When our Premier, Mr Rockliff, was the Minister for Education - I believe some four years ago - he gave an olive branch to our online access centres and introduced the Digital Grants Program. That Digital Grants Program, as I have spoken about in this House before, is due to be fulfilled at the end of this financial year. We know now that a 12-month reprieve has been kindly given by the Minister for Education, understanding that online access centres provide amazing services to their respective communities and understanding their importance. 

However, the future after the 12 months has still not been fully outlined. We also know that the funding which those online access centres currently are provided is highly inadequate, and there has been a dedicated strategy to starve them, I believe, and I understand that there is enough evidence to suggest that. We know that four of those online access centres have closed over the last 12 months, and it is a really silly strategic idea by this government and by whoever has it in for online access centres not to fund them, because they are cost neutral.

The volunteer contribution made by each community to those online access centres neutralises the really insignificant cost that the government pays to keep them open. They are run on the smell of an oily rag and they are run by volunteers. They are volunteers from our communities, and it is so disrespectful for those volunteers to have to go and beg and borrow to keep those services running and the digital services that they provide. They provide a service. They provide instruction. They are not fit to be in our libraries. The function of a library is completely different from the function of an online access centre.

A review was recently undertaken; it came through the Department of Education. That review is full of gaps. It is a terrible review and I believe the review will have to actually be taken again. The consultant - and it is not a personal sledge against that consultant, whether or not they were given poor terms of reference, whether or not they were given a short timeframe, but the community consultation is just about non-existent. I have spoken to a number of mayors from different local government areas who have online access centres and understand the importance of the services that they provide, and they were not even consulted. It is a really bad review, and we understand that the government and the department are aware that that review is inadequate and it should not inform the future of our online access centres.

The Labor policy was to incorporate online access centres away from Libraries Tasmania and pop them into a digital area, because we believe that digital literacy and digital access, especially in some of those remote areas, is absolutely essential. It is actually not a huge spend. You get so much bang for your buck, because you have this amazing group of experienced, dedicated volunteers who do so much good work at their own cost as a service to their community. The investment by government here is absolutely minimal for what you can get. They should be boosted; they need to be respected. We will be pushing for that review to start again and for online access centres to be taken seriously, and for there to be a proper consultation.

I would also like to thank the members of the St Helens Online Access Centre who I met the other day. They are doing an incredible job. They have recently lost their coordinator because they could not afford to pay them anymore. This is happening all across our state and it is not good enough, but we are certainly going to continue with the campaign to make sure our online access centres can continue their work and that they are respected and appropriately funded.


Telecommunications Infrastructure and Digital Inclusion

[7.51 p.m.]
Ms OGILVIE (Clark - Minister for Innovation, Science, and the Digital Economy) - Honourable Speaker, it is my great pleasure to rise this evening to update the House on the state of telecommunications infrastructure and digital inclusion in Tasmania. In relation to telecommunications infrastructure, the Tasmanian government is working closely with regional Tasmanian communities and telecommunication service providers to monitor reports of 5G and 5G mobile connectivity issues.

In March 2024, under the Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future, our government committed $200,000 towards building a new Telstra mobile tower at St Helens to enhance mobile phone connectivity. In December 2024, the Premier confirmed that the government had partnered with East Coast Tourism to deliver a temporary 4G Telstra cell on wheels at St Helens for summer. 

Our government is advocating for regional Tasmanian communities, including the Tasman Peninsula, Swansea, West Coast, Low Head and others, leading regular dialogue with telecommunications service providers, federal parliamentarians and community leaders to ensure this government is across the telecommunications issues being experienced so we can push for better regional connectivity.

The Commonwealth Government's 2024 Regional Telecommunications Review noted telecommunications is an essential service for regional Australia, and ongoing challenges in coverage, capacity and affordability require federal government action and consumer protections.

In relation to digital inclusion, improving digital inclusion is a key priority of our government to ensure all Tasmanians can participate in and excel in Tasmania's exciting future. The Tasmanian government is working hard to ensure that our communities, businesses and public services are well equipped to adopt and adapt to the use of new technologies.

Our government established the statewide Wi-Fi Access Program, which we call SWAP by way of its acronym, which enables Tasmanians to connect to free public wi-fi at a number of Tasmanian government locations across the state, which includes 46 libraries, the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery and 37 other locations. This is innovative and cost neutral to the government, so why not do it? More sites are being evaluated and rolled out. It is very good success story.

This government has also initiated the development of a Tasmanian government digital inclusion strategy. We are working closely with industry, Tas ICT and the community sector, meeting regularly with all the key stakeholders and players.

I was in Glenorchy recently working on a great new program that is handing out laptops to kids who need them at schools. One beautiful family - three children, three laptops. That is working with the community sector - the people who are on the ground at the front line to make these things happen.

Our government is liaising with industry to partner and lead these community-based digital inclusion activities and supporting where we can. As part of our 2023 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future and our fourth 100-day plan, our government has commenced engaging with stakeholders from the community, industry and government sectors to refresh our digital future, which is a strategic document into which we are feeding the ideas, hopes and aspirations of the Tasmanian people.

As we move towards a digital economy, we want to ensure that Tasmania tracks alongside the other states and territories, particularly mainland states, who seem to find it somewhat easier, bizarrely, to get money from a federal Labor government for their telecommunications needs. The digital community objectives and priorities outlined in Our Digital Future will form the basis for the Tasmanian government's Action Plan for Digital Inclusion.

In relation to the member who has just spoken, you might find it helpful to put a submission in relation to what you would like to see with the matter that you just spoke about. I mean that quite genuinely and you can do that at any time.

Telecommunications is, broadly speaking, a federal government responsibility. As a state we work very closely with federal members. I sit on the data and digital minister's meetings and I use my voice at that table to speak up for Tasmania, to promote our needs, and to ensure that we get the connectivity and investment that we need in this state.

I lobby hard; I have written letters to the federal Labor government. I am hopeful of hearing some great announcements coming out of the federal election campaign - that Tasmania will be prioritised to ensure that our telecommunications provision is the same as that which is applied nationally. I have been requesting the necessary investment, but I have not had a response.


Answer to Question - Health Budget - Efficiency Dividends

[7.57 p.m.]
Mrs PETRUSMA (Franklin - Minister for Health) - Honourable Speaker, I committed today in Question Time to respond to the Independent Member for Franklin, Mr O'Byrne. I want to assure him that we fully appreciate that things like Milo, bread, tea, water and icy poles on hot days are essential for staff and patient wellbeing. I am advised that these are still available across the Tasmanian Health Service with no change to ordering processes for standard items. I have also spoken directly to the Secretary of Health today about the issues raised and he will follow up the allegations across all of our hospitals to ensure their processes for ordering and supplying these items is simplified and cleared to all staff.


AFL Stadium Proposal - Labor Party's Position

Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about a matter of overwhelming interest to the Tasmanian community; the Liberal's billion dollar plus stadium- sorry, apologies, that first line of my speech was now actually out of date, so I am just going to start again. Speaker, I rise tonight about a matter of overwhelming interest to the Tasmanian community, the Liberal and the Labor Party's billion dollar plus stadium.

Dr Woodruff - That is right.

Ms BADGER - Since the stadium was proposed, deep concerns have been raised about the priority of spending over a billion dollars on a non-essential stadium. Since day one, it has been opposed by the Greens, by members of the crossbench and members of the Labor Party - sorry, I will just fix that again. Since day one, the stadium has been opposed by the Greens and members of the crossbench. Now, Labor did oppose it on day one until spectacularly backflipping just weeks after making a commitment to voters about their prior position.

Speaker, every Green MP in this place has consistently advocated against the unnecessary stadium and we have fully supported a Tasmanian AFL and AFLW team which our state should have had a very long time ago. Now, we have seen many independents consistently saying the same, and good on them. That opposition to the stadium has been vindicated. This week, the Tasmanian Planning Commission report showed that building the stadium would add nearly $2 billion to Tasmania's debt and would add close to $100 million a year to the budget deficit.

Dr Woodruff - Shame.

Ms BADGER - Now, that is precious money that should be spent on essential things that people need like timely affordable health care. The TPC report outlined problem after insurmountable problem: basically every page had damning quotes and what was the Liberal's response to this? Not only will they forge ahead with this project despite the overwhelming evidence that it is not in this state's best long-term interests, they are also looking at speeding up the planning process, looking at taking a huge shortcut.
Rather than letting the current planning process take its course, the Liberals are seeking advice on bringing special legislation to parliament to directly approve the stadium. Speaker, if either of our two existing stadiums, you know, need the goal posts moved, then the Liberals have proven themselves absolute experts. Now, Tasmanians would reasonably expect the opposition to oppose the Liberal government taking a wrecking ball to proper process, but no.

No, such an expectation would be mistaken because today we heard from Labor that they will support the stadium no matter what: no matter what the cost or how much debt it will cause; no matter what the community thinks. Speaker, too many Tasmanians are struggling to pay their bills, to find a home, to access the health care that they need, but here we have both major political parties in lockstep supporting a non-essential stadium rather than focusing on improving people's lives.

At this point, it is fair to say that the stadium has joint ownership if you will. It is the Labor-Liberal stadium, the Winter-Rock Stadium, perhaps we might call it and, you know, maybe one day we will see designs soon for the Jeremy Rockliff stand on one side and that Dean Winter stand, not opposite, but right beside the Mr Rockliff stand. Before I finish, Speaker, I have just got a little throwback for members. As I said, once upon a time, Labor did have a different position on the stadium and I have just got an old post from Mr Winter's social media -

The SPEAKER - No, you can put it down, Ms Badger. Thank you. You can read from it but not wave it around.

Ms BADGER - The post says, honourable Speaker, Labor will focus on the priorities to make the health of Tasmanians better and it goes on: it shares a petition. The petition is called, wait for it, 'We do not need another stadium' and then the image says, 'Labor Christmas, functional hospitals. Liberal Christmas, unnecessary stadium.'

Mr Winter makes that point extremely well, so credit where credit is due. Those were the good old days, were they not, when it felt like, just for a moment, that we had an opposition that was actually an opposition. The Tasmanians need a government that listens and they need an opposition that will hold the government to account when they are not listening.

Those of us who are on the crossbench are doing our job and we will continue to fight for the essential needs of Tasmanians every step of the way. Rest assured that the stadium will never be built.


Ford Hardtop 50-Year Anniversary
Baskerville Raceway Motorkhana

[8.02 p.m.]
Mr FAIRS (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about a fabulous event I had the pleasure of representing the Premier at recently, the Ford Hardtop 50-year anniversary in Tasmania, which coincided with the 100th anniversary of Ford in Australia. Being a Ford nut, I was honoured to be part of this event. This was the biggest hardtop show ever seen on the Parliament House lawns and it was great to see the strong public turn-out enjoying some of the most iconic cars ever built.

Another highlight was the Motorkhana at Baskerville Raceway. It was wonderful being there with Sport and Events minister Nick Duigan. We both thoroughly enjoyed watching the thundering V8s and the sound of those going around Baskerville was unreal. One of the highlights for me and for many of the few hundred there watching, was the legendary John Goss OAM, who amazingly won the Australian Grand Prix and the Bathurst 1000, which is an incredible feat. To see him in his 80s, fanging around in the John Goss Special - once he was in the car, they could not get him out. He was only meant to do a couple of laps but I think he squeezed in a couple more. He has lost nothing of his competitive spirit. He is as sharp as a tack. It was an amazing highlight to see Mr Goss have a 'fang' like that. I spoke to him afterwards and he said it was about 40 to 50 years since he had raced around Baskerville like that in a John Goss Special. His competitive spirit is still there, well and truly.

More than 180 Ford motor enthusiasts from across the country and even overseas flocked to Tasmania to celebrate the Ford Hardtop anniversary, and they toured Tasmania. They were here for a couple of weeks, a lot of them, and some are still here cruising around our amazing state, enjoying our wild roads and unbelievable scenery, wineries, world-class produce and hospitality. The state government was proud to support this event, contributing $20,000 towards it.

I highlight the hard work and dedication of Chris Callogi and John Chandler and his amazing band of volunteers, because, as we know, if we do not have volunteers, nothing happens. It was incredible. I notice I caught Ms Badger's interest, being a revhead as she is, which is great. There are a few of us around. Chris and John, congratulations to you and your band of volunteers, and also the event sponsors and to all the visitors who came to be part of this event. The last time they assembled, the turnout was bigger than Bathurst. That is something of which we should be incredibly proud.

I also received an email of an article about the event that is going to be published shortly in the national Unique Cars magazine, which is fabulous as well and will no doubt encourage more interstate visitors to head to our shores. I spoke to many of the participants and found out where they were from. I did cry a bit because I had a few Fords over the years and I wish I had hung on to them with the price tag they have today, compared to what I received as a trade-in for them. What I traded them in for is horrifying. In fact, I need to sit down or I will pass out.

Again, congratulations to everyone involved. It was wonderful to be part of the Ford Hardtop 50-year Anniversary and to see so many iconic Fords in one place at one time. For Ford fans like me, it was a dream come true. 


Collins Street Bicycle Lanes

[8.06 a.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, last Tuesday, member for Clark Vica Bayley, member for Hobart Cassy O'Connor and I went to a public meeting held at the Hobart City Hall. It was one of the biggest public meetings I have been to in a very long time. A little under 1000 people filed into the City Hall on Macquarie Street. Many had ridden; others had come by car. There was an array of ages. I believe the member for Clark, Mr Behrakis, was there as well. The Hobart City Council had a responsibility to hold this public meeting after receiving over 1000 signatories requesting the meeting, which was about the proposed bike lanes on Collins Street.
Those bike lanes were proposed as part of the Greater Hobart Cycling Plan. It is part of the network. That network really needed to join up east to west, rather than just down from the main bike lanes, which go from north to south in the city, which are very convenient for those who use it. Bike lanes are really useful for not only car drivers - revheads or otherwise - but because they provide that guide for car drivers and bike riders. You feel a lot safer when you are riding in a bike lane. The Collins Street bike lanes have been quite controversial. This is a trial, and there was significant outcry about having this amenity and upgrade in that part of Collins Street.

The meeting went ahead and there were people speaking for and against the bike lanes. Those who participated voted on various motions. It was one of those public meetings where people really had their say and felt like they were heard. There were three motions against the bike lanes and one for. Those three that were against the bike lanes failed and the motion for the bike lanes to go ahead passed. It was democracy in action. It was important to see. It was one of those things we participate in and we forget the importance of those Town Hall - this time City Hall - meetings.

The council has considered this. There was $170,000 coming from the government, but that was pulled at the last minute. It was unfortunate in many ways. The Greens wanted to find out more about this and, through RTI, found that the Transport minister, Mr Abetz, had said, 'Yes, we are going ahead, we are going to fund this with $170,000. It is not a huge amount of money, but it is a really important step to go in partnership with the local council.' However, Mr Abetz then received an email from Font PR raising concerns about the project. They wanted a response immediately. They received their response and that money was pulled. It only took two days for the minister to change his mind.

The sorry thing is that it is so important that people who ride bikes, and people who would ride bikes if it were safer, are given that opportunity. That busts congestion. The Transport minister should know better.

Time expired.


Child Safety Services

[8.12 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to speak about the question I asked in question time this morning and the answer that was given. This morning I asked the Premier a question about the future of children in Tasmania and highlighted that there are children in Tasmania who are being let down at the moment. Our child safety services and youth justice services are not being sufficiently funded. When I asked that question, the Minister for Children and Young People interjected that there was $30 million going into child safety services and that this was an ongoing commitment year by year.

That does not deny or get rid of the problem, and the fact that services are not being sufficiently funded. I have to say it was really disappointing hearing the Premier's answer this morning. I felt that it was quite a brush-off of a really serious issue.

He started by saying he agreed with the sentiment and then he went on to answer a really serious question by talking about things that were not related to the question that I had asked. At the very end of the question he turned things political by saying, 'Well, the Greens this and the Greens that'. This is a much bigger issue than politics. This is about the children of Tasmania.

At the moment there are enormous problems happening with children and with families. I have been in contact with a lot of community organisations that are providing services to families who are in really difficult situations, and they repeatedly tell me that there is an increase in the complexity of the issues that they are dealing with. They are funded based on funding figures from quite some time ago when the complexity was much less than what it is now, and their funding no longer covers what they need to do to support families.

We know that there are high numbers of children in out-of-home care who have no child safety officer allocated to them. When we asked, I think it was in Budget Estimates last year, it was up in the hundreds of children with no child safety officer who were being managed in teams, and often those teams do not have a qualified social worker allocated to that team.

We know that there are slow responses from the Advice and Referral Line. We know that people are phoning up and doing the right thing, referring on families and situations where support is needed, and that response is being delayed, so families are not getting the support when they need it. We know that there are increased cases currently being referred by the Advice and Referral Line to child safety. 

A few months ago there was a really significant increase - I believe it was a doubling in the number of children who were being referred through, but what we have seen more recently is that there has been a tripling in six months of the daily average cases of children who are pending a child safety assessment. The referral has been made by the Advice and Referral Line through to child safety and then it is sitting there and not being allocated and not being assessed.

They are really concerning figures, and I just want to put on record how concerning and troubling it is to hear this constant talk about how the stadium is going to be wonderful for the future of our state, and yet the futures of the children of Tasmania are being impacted by a lack of resources, a lack of investment in services and a lack of funding. We cannot do this in Tasmania. It is not acceptable to have children and families missing out on the support that they need. It makes a long-term difference in their lives. It sets them on really difficult trajectories. 

We could be doing more, we need to be doing more and the Greens call on the government to not just look at the funding that they are putting in, but to look at the need and make sure that the funding that they give matches the need. They need to look at that in the context of a stadium that is going to take masses of funding and say, 'We can do better for Tasmanians; we can do better for children; we can fund the services they need; and we can make a real transformational difference to their future by changing our priorities'.


AFL Stadium Proposal - Labor Party's Position

[8.16 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - This is not the adjournment speech I planned to give tonight. I have spoken at length about the stadium this week and the damning report of the Tasmanian Planning Commission. I wanted to talk about festivals, but with the revelations today that the Liberals are investigating special tailor-made approval legislation for the stadium to skirt around the Planning Commission and ram through approval a la Gunns pulp mill leaves me no choice. 

Labor's complete and utter acquiescence needs to be called out. It has abrogated its responsibility to hold government to account. Labor has now completely abandoned any sense of the position it took to the last election. Not only has it abandoned the 'no stadium' position it took to the general and Legislative Council elections in 2024, it no longer even conditions its support on the Premier's phony promise of a capped taxpayer spend of $375 million. Support is now unconditional. It seems it supports the stadium at Macquarie Point come what may - no matter the cost, potentially with no assessment whatsoever. Labor will back in the Liberals to ride roughshod over the very process they voted together to establish less than 18 months ago.

Together, by selling out Tasmania and Tasmanians they give the AFL - a billion-dollar corporation with multi-million-dollar annual profits - everything it needs to double down on its blackmail. Together, Labor and the Liberals allow the AFL to anchor onto its completely unreasonable position that Tasmania enter into debt we cannot afford, damage the unique heritage values of our city, disrespect and damage the country's oldest state war memorial and compromise the functionality of its capital city to build a new stadium that Tasmanians do not want, do not need, and cannot afford.

A stadium is the price they gouge from taxpayers in our capital city for the team we have long deserved and the AFL itself needs to truly claim to be a national competition. This week should have been a circuit breaker in the push for stadium at Macquarie Point. The Planning Commission, informed by the panel that stood up and the information the stadium proponent - the government - has offered up, has published a report that is so damning that any clear-thinking government and self-confident, credible opposition would use as an excuse to walk away with face saved.

Instead, we have a coalition, the Lib-Lab coalition on a unity ticket backing this stadium come what may - no matter the cost: the dollars, the debt, the heritage, the traffic, the pedestrian safety, the Aboriginal heritage, the opportunity cost of the site and all the views of the community.
Opposition to the stadium is clear. We hear it on the doors, in our emails, on the radio and in letters. In February, polling showed that an overwhelming 67 per cent of people in the north and 65 per cent of the north-west opposed the stadium. How can you blame them? Putting aside the financial impact, Macquarie Point in Hobart is hardly a central, democratic, easily accessed location for footy folks in the north.

In the south, opposition stands at 55 per cent versus 42 per cent of support. People do not want this stadium. We have two already. We play at Bellerive and have done for years. We have the best playing surface in the country at York Park and AFL has been played there for well over a decade. We support the $130-million upgrade of York Park, and it should be the home of football in Tasmania. No other new team in the AFL was required to build a new stadium. The AFL self-interest was writ large today in its public response to this shambolic stadium situation. It said:

It is complex and it is difficult, but we're really confident that the planning will play out in the way it is and we are really confident that we'll have a stadium.
That is what AFL boss Andrew Dillon said, 'We'll have a stadium.' Let me be clear, you can support an AFL team for Tasmania without supporting the stadium. A stadium was never part of Tasmania's bid. The Premier is still quoted as saying so on the AFL news website. It was not part of the tripartite agreement that Labor, the Greens and the Liberals signed back before the AFL's blackmail kicked in.

If Labor and the Liberals stood together with others in this Chamber and the majority of Tasmanians in rejecting the stadium, and called on the AFL to renegotiate, the deal for a Tassie licence would be in a powerful position. Instead, Labor and the Liberals roll over together and weaken our hand: a stadium at Macquarie Point, come what may.

In doing so, not only do they condemn Tasmanians to decades of debt and Hobart to state-sanctioned vandalism, but they further damage themselves. Once again they demonstrate that they cannot be trusted and are simply not worth your vote. 

The House adjourned at 8.21 p.m.

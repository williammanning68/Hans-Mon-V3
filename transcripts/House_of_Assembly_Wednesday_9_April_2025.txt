STATEMENTS BY SPEAKER

Incorrect Division Tally - 8 April 2025
Disorderly Conduct
Unparliamentary Language

The SPEAKER - Before we commence today, I have a few updates for the House about the processes of the House. I think there is a growing level of not understanding that we are in a very serious place with very serious rules.

First, I advise the House that there was an error in the division tally on the question of the Adjournment of the House last night. There are two tellers. There are three people watching those tellers. Fifteen noes were recorded. The correct number was 14. It did not affect the outcome of the division, so I did not send the numbers back. It is the job of the tellers to make sure that they tell me the right numbers in the House.

In accordance with practice, the tellers will be asked to resign the division lists and the division will be recorded correctly in the votes and proceedings and Hansard.

I use this opportunity to formally remind members that the tellers and whips are responsible for the correct tally of the votes, and care has to be taken to ensure accuracy.

In addition, I draw the House's attention to disorderly conduct of a member who left the House while the division bells were ringing. A member is not prevented from leaving during a division. In fact, there has been a practice allowed in this House in order to enable the pairing arrangements to be honoured for people to leave the House. However, the member audibly interjected and reflected on the proceedings before the House while leaving the Chamber. This is highly disorderly. It will not be tolerated again. I remind members that once the doors are locked, no member can leave the Chamber and they have to vote in the division.

The third matter is using unparliamentary language. Using it in a quote does not make it parliamentary. You must find other ways to have the message or intent on the Hansard. You cannot get away with using unparliamentary language or swear words on the Hansard just because it is in a quote. Thank you.


RECOGNITION OF VISITORS

The SPEAKER - With that, I will do something a bit nicer and acknowledge our visitors. One of the wonderful things about our education program is that we also do some great work with students who study at home. We do have a home learning family joining us today. That is really lovely that they have joined us, and I hope you have a really good time. You are not getting in any trouble today. You are doing fine. I feel like the very grumpy teacher at the moment. 

Members - Hear, hear.


QUESTIONS

Renewable Energy - Impact of Federal Election

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.03 a.m.]
The federal election will be a defining one for Tasmania's renewable energy ambitions. There is more than $25 billion worth of potential projects and thousands of new jobs on the horizon for our state, as long as federal energy policy settings are right. In his budget reply speech a fortnight ago, Peter Dutton said, 'We will scrap Labor's nearly $14 billion of production tax credits for green hydrogen.' That would cause the immediate cancellation of ABEL Energy's project at Bell Bay, costing Tasmania more than 500 new ongoing jobs, 1500 construction jobs, $4 billion worth of economic benefit, and 10 per cent of Tasmania's GSP. Do you support Peter Dutton's plan to cut the hydrogen production tax credit?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I support Peter Dutton in getting this country back on track. That is what I support. I support Peter Dutton when he says that he accepts, understands and appreciates the investment made by Tasmanians, our forebears for generations, when it comes to renewable energy. We are reaping the rewards of our forebears, their hard work, toil, blood, sweat and tears, and the foresight of previous governments in Tasmania to invest in renewable energy, in this case, Hydro industrialization.

Peter Dutton supports that. He understands that and he has been very clear on his support for Marinus as well - far clearer than you were 12 months ago on Marinus.

Mr Winter - You are about to adopt our policy from 12 months ago. How long until you adopt our policy?

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It took a number of years until you decided which way the wind was blowing and you made a call on Marinus.

Mr Winter - You are about to adopt that policy. I would be careful.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Speaking of wind, Marinus brings and unlocks that investment of wind and solar coming to Tasmania. That is why Peter Dutton backs Marinus. He also backs Robbins Island, which is sitting on the desk of a Labor minister right now. What do you say to that? Are you going to call on the federal Labor minister to approve this project? Robbins Island, as I have said previously in the House, of course -

Members interjecting.

Mr WINTER - Point of order.

The SPEAKER - I will take the member's point of order, thank you. The House will come to order so I can hear the point of order.

Mr WINTER - Standing Order, 45, relevance. The question is quite specifically about the hydrogen production tax credits and the Premier has not mentioned the words yet.

The SPEAKER - I will draw the Premier to that aspect of the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - As I recall, when it comes to hydrogen investment, it was a bipartisan commitment by both major parties at the last federal election, if my memory serves me correctly.

Members interjecting.  

The SPEAKER - I have called relevance. I will not have interjections.

Mr ROCKLIFF - What we are about is working with the federal government, irrespective of the colour of that government, to benefit Tasmania and Tasmanians. That is why we are frustrated with the federal government's procrastination on Robbins Island. We were disappointed it took so long -

Dr Broad - Whose fault is that?

The SPEAKER - Dr Broad.

Mr ROCKLIFF - to stand up for salmon when it comes to -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. 

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - To repeat the question: does the Premier support Peter Dutton's plan to cut the hydrogen production tax credit?

The SPEAKER - I will call the Premier to that question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the member for his question. I am advised that Labor is cutting the Hydrogen Highways program in its budget. We are committed to the delivery of a green hydrogen hub at Bell Bay. There was $70 million first committed by the Coalition through the Clean Hydrogen Industrial Hubs program. We have a signed deed with the Commonwealth and we are focused on delivery, not playing politics.

Ms FINLAY - Honourable Speaker, point of order, Standing Order 45, relevance on the follow-up question. It is about the hydrogen production tax.

The SPEAKER - Thank you. The member can resume her seat. I have called the Premier to answer the supplementary. He has 16 seconds left if he wishes to address it.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the member for his question. I have outlined in my answer where federal Labor stands on -

The SPEAKER - The member's time has expired to answer the question.


Energy - Federal Coalition Green Hydrogen Policy

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.08 a.m.]
ABEL Energy wrote to Peter Dutton today to plead for an exemption from his planned cuts for its project. I have a copy of the letter and I will read from it. It says:

I note your statement of intention to repeal the hydrogen credit and withdraw other support for new zero carbon industries under the current Commonwealth policy. The repeal of the hydrogen production tax offset and other support under established policies will jeopardise this transformative project. I am sure that you will not intend those negative effects for northern Tasmania. I seek your assistance that any changes in policy will not apply to Bell Bay Power Fuels. Without that assurance we would have to pause work on a project at a critical time.

What they are saying is that Peter Dutton's policy will kill their project and cost thousands of jobs. Will you join with me in opposing Peter Dutton's reckless cuts?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. I just highlighted my understanding of federal Labor's budget and their cutting of the hydrogen budget investment. As Peter Dutton has said, in terms of working with - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - the state government supporting Marinus, I am sure Mr Dutton will work with major industrials, in fact, all Tasmanian businesses, whether that be large, medium or small, in the best interest of Tasmania. That is why he supports Robbins Island, Marinus, mining, aquaculture and forestry.

Dr Broad - He is not supporting this project.

Members interjecting.  

The SPEAKER - Dr Broad, members on my right. The Premier can answer without your help.

Mr ROCKLIFF - He made his support for our resource-based industries clear in Tasmania the other day because he understands the value of an economy that is reliant largely on the resource-based sector in terms of mining, forestry, aquaculture, agriculture and the like. He does not play politics to get Greens' mainland votes like the Labor Party does, which is why -

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The question is specifically about the hydrogen production tax credits and he has not -

The SPEAKER - Thank you. You do not get to restate the question that you did not ask. You have called relevance. I will draw the Premier to the original question which was reasonably specific.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=12.4_D=1.2_C=0.58] Mr ROCKLIFF - I believe I have answered the question when it comes to Mr Dutton's support of renewable energy in Tasmania, Marinus and Robbins Island. What Peter Dutton will not do is trade away Tasmania for Green votes on the mainland. That is why Robbins Island is sitting on the federal environment minister's desk right now.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=51.9_D=25.1_C=0.55] Mr WINTER - Peter Dutton's policy will cost ABEL Energy 500 ongoing jobs. Will the Premier pick up the phone to Peter Dutton and tell him his policy is reckless and will cost Tasmanian jobs? 

The SPEAKER - It does go to the original question, which was about joining you in an opposition. It is slightly reworked but I think it is the same intent to the question, so I will allow the [Bookmark: Phr6_O=77.9_D=0.7_C=0.76]  supplementary.

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=82.6_D=1.3_C=0.35] I will engage with [Bookmark: Phr8_O=85.9_D=19.3_C=0.77]  all Tasmanians and Tasmanian investors for the benefit of Tasmania. If that means picking up the phone to Prime Minister Albanese, I will. If that means picking up the phone to Prime Minister Dutton, I will. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - [Bookmark: Phr9_O=109.6_D=14.8_C=0.55]  You have been very quiet lately on salmon.

Ms Finlay - We are genuine supporters of salmon, not like you.
The SPEAKER - The member for Bass will stop interjecting. The member for Bass is warned.

Mr ROCKLIFF - [Bookmark: Phr10_O=126.8_D=16.2_C=0.52]  Very quiet. 

Mr Winter - We put a release out seven minutes ago about it, actually.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You knew it was coming and gave yourself some cover seven minutes before Question Time. You said, 'I reckon Rockliff is going to get into me today about salmon', and you were right.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The time for answering the question has expired and the House will come to order.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Timing of Enabling Legislation

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=153.7_D=2.4_C=0.85] Mr BAYLEY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.14 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=157.9_D=23.1_C=0.79] It is clear to everybody that you are trying to whip up a false sense of urgency to justify forcing special legislation to approve the stadium through this parliament. The AFL has repeatedly confirmed that they are happy for the Project of State Significance (POSS) process to run its course. Since you will not rule out enabling legislation entirely, will you at least rule out bringing it in before the Budget?

ANSWER
 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=183.1_D=1.5_C=0.65] 
Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I am not going to reflect on a [Bookmark: Phr17_O=203.0_D=24.0_C=0.70]  vote of another place, but that is why there are glum faces over there, I suspect. We will do what we need to do regarding the stadium infrastructure. That could be continuing with the POSS process, which is currently ongoing. There are also the pressing timelines, the fact [Bookmark: Phr19_O=233.4_D=29.2_C=0.82]  the Tasmanian Devils are in the midst of an important recruitment process and the ongoing uncertainty that brings when it comes to attracting key personnel for the club, and the fact that we need to get on and break ground on the state-of-the-art training facility at Kingston [Bookmark: Phr20_O=263.1_D=27.4_C=0.77] . The upper House local member opposes that and those millions of dollars of investment.

There is a lot happening. Timelines are crucially important, and I will do what I need to do in terms of giving the public its say, but also ensuring that this House and the Legislative Council [Bookmark: Phr21_O=291.4_D=0.8_C=0.42]  have the opportunity to vote on this project. Whether it is the POSS process or it is enabling legislation, it is important to recognise that this parliament - democracy, in other words - will have its say.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Mr BAYLEY - The Premier said that he will do whatever he needs to do, including the opportunity for the public to have their say. Part of the POSS process with the public having their say is public hearings. Is that a commitment to allowing the public hearings component of the POSS to continue prior to bringing in any of the special legislation, should you do that?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I hate the fact that I have to rule on it. I do not necessarily need people's assistance. It is difficult enough without that. The original question was whether or not the Premier would rule out bringing it in before the budget. He has not ruled anything out. He is leaving his options open - that is the answer that I have written down - but he did refer to the public having their say, so I will allow the supplementary on that basis.

If people are uncomfortable with how I am ruling on supplementary questions, I am very keen at some stage for the Standing Orders Committee to have another look at this, because it does become very subjective for me to make the call. I call the Premier to the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the member for the question. What the Greens are famous for is changing the goal posts.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark, Ms Ogilvie, Deputy Leader of the Greens.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You voted against the POSS process. Remember that. Now, you are talking about sticking with the process.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my right.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We are always held accountable for what we say from one time to the next, and you need to have a good hard think about what you say from one time to the next as well.

Mr Bayley - Speaker, point of order, Standing Order 45, relevance.

The SPEAKER - You need to seek the call first. I will give you the call on a point of order on relevance, and I will draw the Premier to the question, although the Premier is resuming his seat, which he is entitled to do. I will call the next question.

Dr Woodruff - Is he going to allow public hearings? That was the question. He did not answer it.

The SPEAKER - You have opportunities to ask other questions. You do not have opportunities to interject when a member has been given the call. Mr O'Byrne has the call. 


Macquarie Point Stadium Independent Report - Appointment of Dr Gruen

Mr O'BYRNE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.19 a.m.]
You may have seen the ABC report this morning raising some questions about the appointment of Dr Nicholas Gruen to do an independent report of the Macquarie Point Stadium. Can you confirm Dr Gruen was the only person put forward by the Jacqui Lambie Network (JLN) to do this report as a part of their supply and confidence agreement with you? If so, on what date was he put forward by the JLN, and on what date was he appointed by you to do this work?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. I might have to come back to the exact dates, but I will do my best in terms of my memory. Following the election, we had the courage to stand up and form government when others did not want to. That meant we had crossbench discussions about people's objectives and what they wanted to see in various agreements to ensure supply and confidence. With supply and confidence comes certainty.

Part of our discussions with the JLN was the stadium report, if I can put it that way. I believe that, to the best of my knowledge, Dr Gruen was the only person put forward by the JLN at the time. I stand to be corrected, but I believe that is right. There were discussions in around April last year and I understand there was some insistence on appointing Dr Gruen. To the best of my knowledge, that was formalised in May last year, but I will come back to the House with exact dates.

Thank you, Mr O'Byrne. I am aware of the ABC report.

The SPEAKER - I am noting that that has been taken on notice. 


ABEL Energy - Exemption from Tax Cuts

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.21 a.m.]
I understand ABEL Energy has tried to get Bridget Archer and Susie Bower to intervene and secure an exemption for northern Tasmania from Peter Dutton's cuts. They have done nothing, though. They will not stand up for Tasmania against Peter Dutton's reckless anti-renewables energy policy. Will you stand up for jobs and economic investment in Tasmania and tell Peter Dutton that his cuts to the hydrogen production tax credits will damage Tasmania's economy? or, like Susie Bower and Bridget Archer, will you put Peter Dutton's political interests and nuclear plan ahead of Tasmania's renewable energy future?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I will always stand up for Tasmania, irrespective of who is in the federal government and who is prime minister at the time. We will always look at what is best for Tasmania. In fact, as I have publicly said on a number of occasions publicly, we have endorsed the policy objectives put forward by 11 key organisations, including representatives from business and tourism and others, about a number of key policy objectives that those key stakeholders would like to see both major parties commit to at this election. 

They both have some way to go, I hasten to add, but we will still keep lobbying and supporting key policy commitments, including standing up for key industries but also key investments that will enable this economy to continue to grow with certainty as well.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question, but it is going to be tight.

Mr WINTER - I want to make sure - it is not very clear from the Premier's answer - is the Premier saying that he will stand up against Peter Dutton's cuts to the hydrogen credit scheme?

The SPEAKER - In fairness, I believe the Premier has answered the question.

Mr Winter - Is the answer 'yes', Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I cannot genuinely make him say 'yes' or 'no'. He has answered the question that you have asked, so I do not think I can allow that as a supplementary. Once again, it is a subjective process.


TasNetworks - Restrictions for Private Power Connections

Mrs PENTLAND question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

[10.24 a.m.]
Electrical contractors and consumers are being left in limbo across the state due to TasNetworks' service and installation rules and a standoff with some local councils. Restrictions surrounding private power connections are holding up critical housing developments, increasing consumer costs and creating safety concerns, not to mention the eyesore of unnecessary additional above-ground infrastructure. When was this issue first brought to your attention? If your government is really committed to cutting red tape, what is your solution?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I am aware of the current debate about seeking and gaining approvals for connections between private residents and TasNetworks' power infrastructure. You asked specifically in your question about how long I have been aware of that issue. Without an exact date, I would say it has been a month or two, potentially, that I have been aware of that particular issue. I am aware that it is particularly frustrating for customers who are being told that they need to install their own private pole - in some cases, just metres away from either their residence or the TasNetworks' pole.

I have made it abundantly clear to TasNetworks that I expect this issue to be resolved quickly. I understand that in doing so, TasNetworks, councils and the Department of Justice, who are responsible for Consumer, Building and Occupational Services, need to work together on a sensible pathway forward.

Safety and appropriate installation of electrical infrastructure has to be a priority, and I am advised that a potential solution has been identified with all parties. TasNetworks is continuing to work with the AER, Australian Energy Regulator to address both new and legacy connections. I encourage any affected customers to engage with TasNetworks on options available to them while a long-term solution is resolved. As I say, I am very focused on getting a resolution to this.

Essentially, the rules for connecting a customer's power supply require a council approval to cross underneath council land, be that a footpath or a nature strip, and the recording of that information on the Dial Before You Dig Australia register. Some councils have changed their position and are not providing that approval. That has been a position taken by councils in relatively recent times. There is some movement about the acceptance of risk in those areas. As I say, I want to see this issue resolved. It is red tape writ large and we want it gone.


 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.5_D=29.5_C=0.80] Commission of Inquiry Recommendations - Timelines

Ms ROSOL question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.27 a.m.]
You have made a big deal about the need to ensure we meet the AFL deadlines for the construction of the stadium. You have also talked about the stadium's importance to young Tasmanians. Premier, the commission of inquiry (COI) recommended that Ashley Youth Detention Centre (AYDC) be closed as soon as possible. We still have not seen any meaningful progress towards AYDC's closure. You decided not to meet recommended COI timeframes for training for child safety officers in understanding sexual abuse and grooming, departmental representation in court for children in out-of-home care, mental health diversions for children in the justice system, and empowering magistrates to order therapeutic interventions for children displaying harmful sexual behaviours. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=60.2_D=15.8_C=0.81]  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=76.5_D=13.4_C=0.72]  Your priorities for the future of children are wrong way round. Why are you treating the AFL's timelines as sacred and the COI timeframes as optional? 

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=94.9_D=6.4_C=0.78] ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I utterly reject your question utterly [Bookmark: Phr7_O=102.6_D=7.9_C=0.70] . We have made very clear commitments to investing in the recommendations  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=111.0_D=26.8_C=0.81] of the commission of inquiry report, first accepting the recommendations and then, as our last budget clearly outlined, investing significantly in ensuring those recommendations are fulfilled in the support and safety of our young people.
On 1 December 2023, we released 'Keeping Children Safe and Rebuilding Trust',  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=138.6_D=7.0_C=0.73] our response to the final report of the commission of inquiry into the Tasmanian Government's responses to child sexual abuse in institutional settings. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=146.3_D=25.4_C=0.83]  Last budget we invested $35.86 million over the forward Estimates to improve the youth justice system in Tasmania and implement commission of inquiry recommendations.

Our actions must give meaning to the commission of inquiry's report and they must reflect the hope that we all have for the future of this and coming generations of Tasmanian children. We are committed to closing Ashley Youth Detention Centre as soon as possible. I am sure the Minister for Children and Youth, Mr Jaensch, can provide more detail in terms of your question. The new facility  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=190.7_D=18.9_C=0.72] is part of a broader reform program aimed at improving youth justice in Tasmania by providing a therapeutic model of care that focuses on rehabilitation and intensive intervention for young people in detention. The design of the new facility is underway with the Tasmanian youth justice facility master plan  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=210.4_D=3.9_C=0.87] scheduled to be publicly released shortly.


 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=220.0_D=21.5_C=0.83] Rewiring the Nation Fund - North West Transmission Developments

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.30 a.m.]
The Rewiring the Nation Fund is critical for financing the North West Transmission Developments. In his Budget Reply speech a fortnight ago, Peter Dutton said, 'We will end the reckless $20 billion Rewiring the Nation Fund.' Do you agree with Peter Dutton that the Rewiring the Nation Fund is reckless and should be ended?  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=242.0_D=9.5_C=0.80] If you do, can you explain how you intend to fund and finance the North West Transmission Developments that is so critical for building Tasmania's renewable energy future? 

ANSWER
 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=263.4_D=6.7_C=0.68] 
Honourable Speaker, my understanding is that the North West Transmission Developments is funded through the Clean Energy Corps. I am not sure you got your facts right, even in the question. It is disappointing. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=271.7_D=25.2_C=0.63]  Peter Dutton has made very clear -

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - his support for Marinus and his support for renewable energy in Tasmania - very clear. This is one of your silly games  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=297.8_D=6.9_C=0.61] that you often play, trying to bring out the wedge and all sorts of silly games that you play in this place. We have seen it before. We saw it last week, when a couple of weeks ago you set up a committee of this place looking at privatisation -

Members interjecting.

Mr Willie - You have not withdrawn it. It is still relevant.

Ms Haddad - Your terrible plan to privatise GBEs.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.
Mr ROCKLIFF - and the next week, you canned your own motion, effectively. You are all over the place, particularly when it comes to energy assets and selling off, divesting of those assets. You have had a number of different positions on it. Anything you are bringing forward -

Mr Willie - Wait until you backflip.

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Mr Willie, you are in no position to talk about backflips, alright?

Mr Willie - Local government reform, lowering the school age, underground bus mall, northern suburbs rail. Do you want me to keep going?

Ms Ogilvie - More backflips than a toddler on a trampoline.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark on both sides, Mr Willie and Ms Ogilvie.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Ten out of ten, you are for backflips.

Mr WINTER - Point of order.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The point of order is allowed. I do not care how sad you are.

Mr WINTER - Standing Order 45, relevance. I am actually really keen to find out the Premier's views on this. The question was: does he agree with Peter Dutton that Rewiring the Nation is a reckless policy and should be ended?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Just because I cannot see you, Mr Ellis, does not mean I cannot hear you.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Peter Dutton is committed to Marinus. He is committed to Robbins Island. The federal government are all over the place on Robbins. You were all over the place on Marinus for a number of years, and indeed, all over the place when it comes to that key energy policy of yours you took to the last election where you gutted Hydro. That policy lasted for less than 48 hours. We fully understand -

Mr Winter - What was that?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I am sorry. We are not having conversations across the Chamber. The Premier has the call. He is the only one whose voice is being heard and recorded.

Mr ROCKLIFF - As a state government, we are very strongly committed to progressing -

The SPEAKER - Thank you. The time has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - It is a supplementary, if that is okay. It is to ask the same question again. Can the Premier explain how he intends to fund and finance the North West Transmission Developments if Peter Dutton cuts the financing?

The SPEAKER - I will call the Premier to the question. He may have actually addressed it in his opening comments by saying it came from a different fund.

Mr Winter - He is wrong. 

The SPEAKER - Well, that will be a debating point and you have other forms of the House with which to deal with that. However, the Premier has resumed his seat and I will take Ms Johnston.


Public Transport System

Ms JOHNSTON question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.34 a.m.]
I learned this week of an 11-year-old girl on her way to school waiting alone at a bus stop for an hour and a half for three buses that never arrived. In the end, she had to go home because she had no way of getting to school with her parents at work. Meanwhile, events at your vanity project, the stadium, require 80 new buses and who knows how many extra drivers for AFL games and other events. When 11-year-old girls cannot get to school because of your failing public transport system, why should Tasmanians have any confidence you can get them to and from your stadium to watch a football game? Will you prioritise scarce public transport resources so that Tasmanians can get to a footy game instead of school?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I will take the question at face value as it is presented, and if that example is right, it is not good enough. Very poor. If that is the case, then the services let that young person and the family down. That is appalling.

However, can I also say, I do not agree with the way you framed the question. We will invest in public transport services, whether that be to support a reliable and consistent public transport network across Tasmania, or in terms of a school bus service, or for major events as well, whether a stadium is part of the major events or other opportunities for events that draw a lot of people requiring additional public transport. 
Salmon - Mass Mortality Crisis - Consumption of Diseased Fish

Dr WOODRUFF question to MINISTER for MENTAL HEALTH and WELLBEING, Mr JAENSCH

[10.37 a.m.]
Salmon industry mouthpiece, Luke Martin, was recently asked a specific question by a journalist from the Saturday Paper, namely whether diseased Atlantic salmon that have been treated with antibiotics are being withheld from processing for [Bookmark: Phr3_O=34.4_D=2.3_C=0.92]  human consumption for the mandated two months. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=37.3_D=29.7_C=0.81]  He was unable or unwilling to answer. We already know diseased salmon are being processed for human consumption. We are hearing of multiple recent cases of gastrointestinal illness following the consumption of salmon. Restaurants are taking salmon off their tables. Stores are removing it from their shelves. The RSPCA has withdrawn certification. Our waterways are being polluted, and Tasmania's brand is suffering. 

It would be unconscionable if consumers are not only being served diseased fish, but also fish contaminated with oxytetracycline. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=67.7_D=10.8_C=0.72]  Can you demonstrate the mandated two-month withholding period is being observed by the companies, or is this another example of your hands-off industry self-regulation? 

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=87.4_D=23.5_C=0.82] Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. I would like to reassure the parliament, and anyone listening or watching this, that salmon produced and sold in Tasmania is safe to eat when you store it and prepare it and handle it, like any other animal product in your home: keep it refrigerated, follow suitable precautions for ensuring that your food is well-cooked, et cetera.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=112.0_D=5.9_C=0.81] We are advised very clearly, and have been advising the public, that the bacterium [Bookmark: Phr8_O=118.5_D=24.7_C=0.86]  that has contributed to the mass salmon mortalities in itself is a fish-specific pathogen and does not in itself pose a risk to human health or food safety. We are aware, and the Public Health Service is aware, that salmon at some of the leases in the lower D'Entrecasteaux Channel have been administered with an antibiotic to treat the bacterial infection [Bookmark: Phr9_O=144.0_D=9.7_C=0.81]  that is affecting salmon stock. In Tasmania, the safety of commercially produced seafood is overseen and regulated under the Primary Produce Safety Act 2011 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=154.1_D=27.4_C=0.85]  which is administered by the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania (NRE Tas) in Tasmania. 

Commercially farmed salmon treated with the antibiotic are subject to mandatory withholding times, which set a date before which treated fish cannot be harvested. The timeframe is determined by water temperature at the time. Fish treated with the antibiotic are also required to comply with the requirements of the Australian and New Zealand Food Standards Code, which specifies a maximum residue limit [Bookmark: Phr11_O=182.3_D=6.3_C=0.78]  for the antibiotic in fish and product for sale must comply with the maximum residue limits.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=189.0_D=14.3_C=0.86] Seafood producers are required to ensure that the food they produce complies with the requirements of the code. This is regulated by NRE Tas under the Primary Produce Safety Act 2011. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=205.1_D=22.9_C=0.81]  The safety act is the primary mechanism for the safe production and supply of primary produce including seafood, meat, eggs, dairy, and horticulture. If an issue is not appropriately managed at this point, and not suitable for supply under the act, and the product subsequently makes it to the marketplace, the broad provisions of the Food Act could be applied to manage suitability issues [Bookmark: Phr14_O=228.5_D=24.2_C=0.84]  within the retail sector. We are advised that the relevant audits and inspections have indicated that compliance is being met by producers and that the fish sold for human consumption in Tasmania is safe to eat. 

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Dr WOODRUFF - The minister said that there has been [Bookmark: Phr15_O=253.5_D=10.7_C=0.58] , as I understand it, spot inspections.

Mr JAENSCH - No, I did not say that. 

Dr Woodruff - Well, sorry, no. You made reference to compliance checks.

The SPEAKER - You do not get to have a discussion with him. 'Regular audits and inspections', I believe.

Dr WOODRUFF - Can you demonstrate and be confident that the mandated two-month period is being observed and that all fish sold from Tasmania is free of that antibiotic and disease-free or is it being self-regulated?

The SPEAKER - The time for answering the supplementary has well-and-truly expired. I will allow the minister to repeat [Bookmark: Phr17_O=292.0_D=12.4_C=0.79]  the part of his answer addressing it, because I think that has been addressed. You may ask another question if you wish to after this, Dr Woodruff. You have entitlement.

Mr JAENSCH - I am advised that recent audits conducted by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries as late as 17 March this year have indicated compliance on all fronts.

Dr Woodruff - Can you table that information and make it public?

The SPEAKER - The Leader of the Greens does not get to do that. If you wish to have the member table a document, there are other forms of the House via which you can do it, or you can have another question in a moment. 


Rewiring the Nation Fund

Ms FINLAY question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

[10.42 a.m.]
Peter Dutton has clearly stated that if the Liberals are elected he will abolish the Rewiring the Nation Fund. This means the abolition of the deeply concessional finance arrangements for the North West Transmission Developments. In 2022, when the arrangement was first struck, the former Energy minister, now the Treasurer, said:

This low-cost financing from Rewiring the Nation will reduce the annual cost of Project Marinus for electricity customers by up to half. By working together we have been able to achieve a solution that we will see once Marinus Link is built. Tasmanian customers are to pay no more than 15 per cent of the estimated total project costs across both Marinus Link and North West Transmission.

If the former Energy minister said the funding would halve cost to households and businesses, can you confirm that Peter Dutton's policy to abolish Rewiring the Nation will double costs? If so, do you oppose it? 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question, and for the focus on Tasmania's fantastic renewable energy agenda set by this government, championed by the Treasurer, the former Energy minister. I point to comments made not only by the Leader of the Coalition, Peter Dutton, but also in conversations that I have had with the shadow minister for energy, Ted O'Brien, and they are both on the record as being very supportive of Tasmania's renewable energy agenda. There is unambiguous support.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on both sides.

Mr DUIGAN - I do not really mind what they call the bucket of money from which our deeply concessional finance is drawn, so long as those benefits continue to flow, which they will, to Tasmanian consumers. That is the key consideration because our energy agenda drives Tasmania forward in a really positive way. It is a huge opportunity and we are committed to that pathway, as are our federal coalition partners and indeed the Australian Labor Party at a federal level. We all see the benefit in this and this is the pathway upon which we will go.

There is work to be done. We need to learn and we are learning. The whole of state business case will examine all attributes of project Marinus and we will continue to do the work. We will not be making rash and foolish statements like the Leader of the Opposition such as, 'Build it in its entirety without delay, without knowing what it costs,' which amounts to forging ahead without any sort of rationale behind our actions.

We will do the work because, under this government, power prices in Tasmania over the last 10 years in real terms have gone down; this is in the context of a hugely inflationary environment, where everything else pretty much has gone the other way. Power prices in this state have gone down. 

Under Labor it increased 65 per cent, as I understand it. I was not here at that time but I remember paying the bills and they were going in the other direction. Thank you, Ms Finlay. I appreciate the question. Do not mind where the money comes from; we will continue to deliver our energy agenda.

Supplementary Question

Ms FINLAY - A supplementary question, Speaker?
The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms FINLAY - Actually, it does matter where the money comes from and if it has been abolished. My question to the minister is: Dutton has said that he will abolish the funds -

The SPEAKER - I will stop the member. You do have to refer to people via their name or title, please.

Ms FINLAY - Peter Dutton has indicated that he will abolish the funding. Whatever it is called, he said it has gone, which will mean a doubling of costs in Tasmania. The question to the minister is: does he support this, and is he therefore aware that the costs will double and what will he do about it? 

The SPEAKER - The member will resume her seat. I will call the minister to that part of the question: the cost implication.

Mr DUIGAN - I thank the member for the question again. Mr Dutton has put on the public record his commitment to our energy agenda and we have secured with the Commonwealth government deeply concessional finance -

Ms Finlay - He has put on the record that he will cut it.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass, you have the supplementary.

Mr DUIGAN - for our projects associated with Project Marinus. It is my expectation that those obligations by the Commonwealth Government will be met.


Rewiring the Nation Fund

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.47 a.m.]
The Rewiring the Nation Fund is also what will enable Project Marinus to finally get built. Like the North West Transmission Developments, Marinus is essential infrastructure for building Tasmania's renewable energy future. In his budget reply speech a fortnight ago, Peter Dutton said, 'We will end the reckless $20 billion Rewiring the Nation Fund.' After 11 years of you talking about Marinus, you still have not made a final investment decision and your Energy minister is still working out the business case. How will Marinus ever get built if Peter Dutton cancels the program that is funding it? Do you agree with Peter Dutton's policy? Do you believe that it is the reckless one and will be bad for Tasmania?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, my recollection is that Peter Dutton has said there will be money in the budget for Marinus. I stand to be corrected, but that is my recollection.

The irony of you talking about 11 years and all sorts of things when you lot could not even decide whether or not you supported Marinus 12 months ago -

Mr Winter - You were about to adopt our policy, Premier.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition and members on my right, the Premier will be heard in silence.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You only have to go back to the Hansard where I was speaking of Marinus and the importance of bipartisan support, if I recall, and how disappointing it is that you were not supporting Marinus and could not make a decision.

You are sitting on the fence once again, Mr Winter. You were in that chair. You were in Dr Broad's chair. Dr Broad was next to you when he was shadow treasurer. He is not now, but you are the Leader of the Opposition now. It is taking you some time to come to the Marinus party.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left. I have been flexible in allowing the question because it is close to some business that we will be debating later today. The Premier has the call.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The first agreement to take Marinus forward contained the Prime Minister's, Mr Albanese's, signature and mine. We are still working through important matters when it comes to Marinus, but the state and federal governments and the federal opposition are absolutely committed to Marinus.

Ms Finlay - What about the North West Transmission Developments?

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary, which is coming from the Leader of the Opposition, not the member for Bass.

Mr WINTER - The Premier said in his answer that he was still working through matters with the federal government. Can the Premier confirm that he has effectively put Tasmania's stake in Marinus up for sale?

The SPEAKER - Thank you. I will allow the question because it does come from the answer. I will call the Premier to the question, please.

Mr ROCKLIFF - As I have indicated in previous answers today, we will do whatever it takes in the best interests of Tasmania. Also, the federal Leader of the Opposition just this weekend has come out strongly in support of Marinus, saying, 'We were the architects.' Of course, that is all missing a bit - the federal Coalition were actually the ones who put Marinus forward. We welcome the federal Labor Party coming on board -

Mr Winter - You could not get a deal done with them for years.
The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ROCKLIFF - but it took you lot years to work out your position on Marinus. Mr Dutton said we were the architects of Marinus Link, so we remain committed to it and we will make sure that it is completed.


Retired Police Officers - Mental Health Support

Mr JENNER question to MINISTER for POLICE, FIRE and EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Mr ELLIS 

[10.51 a.m.]
Last week, I moved a motion urging the government to immediately fund ongoing mental health support for retired and former police officers. Since then, I have received numerous calls, emails and messages from former paramedics, firefighters, nurses and SES workers asking whether a similar support is available for them for the services related to mental health injuries that were not reported at the time. Although I appreciate there are current budget restraints, we are talking about mental health for former frontline workers - and how can we put a price on that? Can you confirm whether these workers who sustained injuries whilst working but did not report them at the time have access to professional support after they retire?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for Lyons for his question and his interest in this matter. I am looking forward to continuing to work with you around this important challenge. We want to protect our frontline workers. We want to make sure that they are kept safe, and I welcome your interest in ensuring that they are supported after they retire as well.

You have asked me about a range of different workers, some of whom are not in my area of direct responsibility, so I will focus largely on the parts of the workforce that we work closely with. I am sure my other colleagues will be able to update you further.

This government has made significant investments in ensuring that people are properly cared for while they are in the service. I mentioned before about our nation-leading wellbeing program that other states are really looking to as the model for how we can best care for our first responders. I understand my office has reached out to yours about the meeting that I offered last week. Of course, that offer continues to stand. I look forward to working with you and the director of wellbeing support about what opportunities we may have there.

In terms of our government's posture with some of the other emergency service workers, we have been very strong in ensuring that there is support for people. If you look at the last 12 to 18 months, the expansion of the presumptive cancer list for firefighters in Tasmania is actually a world first. The cancers that we extended our presumptive cancer list to were nine cancers, including female-specific cancers - because one of the black spots that we had in our coverage and that we have in coverage around the world in what has traditionally been a male-dominated industry, is female-specific cancers - primary-site uterine cancer, primary-site ovarian cancer. It is important that we that we back in our female firefighters, because we have growing numbers coming through.

I also want to pay tribute to the work of my colleague and predecessor, minister Petrusma, who expanded the testing for PFAS (Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) for our current serving members of the Tasmanian Fire Service (TFS), but also for retired members of the Tasmanian Fire Service.

That was introduced in January 2022, and the testing regime is free and available to current and former personnel: that is career and volunteer, as well as staff from the engineering and fleet services unit. The program was initially scheduled to conclude after two years, but in my time with TFS, we committed to continue it indefinitely. To date, we have had 95 tests completed and three that returned levels above normal.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr JENNER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question from Mr Jenner.

Mr JENNER - I draw the minister's attention to the last part. Minister, can you confirm whether or not those workers who sustained injuries whilst working but did not report them at the time will have access to professional support? I appreciate everything he has just said about cancer, but it was mental health I was specifically focusing on.

The SPEAKER - I will call the minister, who can only answer for the people who are involved in his portfolio area. With those limitations, the supplementary is in order.

Mr ELLIS - I appreciate the supplementary. As I mentioned before, I am happy to work with you through the opportunities with the program that you have proposed. It is important that we get it right.

Obviously, our posture that I was speaking about is to make sure that we are supporting people as they serve our state. We clearly have a posture to support people with their physical health afterwards, as we have demonstrated with PFAS testing and the expansion of presumptive cancers. It is also important to remind any first responders watching that workers compensation claims can be made by resigned and retired members. It will only be accepted in exceptional circumstances, noting claims need to be made within six months of the injury or illness. However, we are happy to work with you, and the offer of the meeting still stands.  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.6_D=6.8_C=0.61] I encourage all members of our emergency services to seek the support they need. 

The SPEAKER - The minister's time to answer the question has expired.


North West Regional Hospital - Hydrotherapy Pool

Mrs BESWICK question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

[10.57 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=45.2_D=24.3_C=0.81] The closure of the hydrotherapy pool at the North West Regional Hospital has created frustration and anger for physiotherapists and their clients. You are quoted in The Advocate saying the pool no longer meets best-practice standards and will be repurposed into an administrative space. Can you please explain why we can afford to build a brand-new football stadium in Hobart but cannot modernise a hydrotherapy pool in the north-west?

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=71.0_D=2.5_C=0.65] ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=76.8_D=29.2_C=0.82] Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for Braddon for her question and for her interest in this matter. I am advised that the Tasmanian Health Service ceased use of the North West Regional Hospital hydrotherapy pool in 2020 due to ongoing infection prevention and control measures, and restrictions within the hospital following the COVID-19 pandemic. I am advised that during this time, patients who required aquatic physiotherapy have been supported to access alternative pools that meet relevant  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=106.3_D=27.0_C=0.81] professional standards under the supervision of Tasmanian Health Service physiotherapists. Assessments of the facility, including by an independent infection prevention and control service provider, have identified that the facility no longer meets best-practice standards. Due to these safety concerns, the pool was closed permanently in mid-February this year. 

Importantly, I am advised that staff of the Tasmanian Health Service or patients of the Tasmanian  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=134.3_D=3.8_C=0.85] Health Service have not been adversely impacted by the permanent closure of the pool [Bookmark: Phr9_O=138.6_D=26.0_C=0.79]  as public patients who require acute aquatic physiotherapy are continuing to access this service at community pools. This service is delivered by our qualified Tasmanian Health Service and other physiotherapists, as has been the case for the last five years while the North West Regional pool has not been used. 

I have visited the site and been shown the space where our physiotherapists are currently working. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=165.7_D=9.9_C=0.81]  Their desks and computers are in a very small area where their patients are. They do not have proper clinical space where they can  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=176.5_D=29.4_C=0.84] provide physiotherapy services. What this allows us to do is to give our hard-working healthcare professionals at the North West Regional Hospital space to have their desks and computers. It ensures greater patient privacy because the existing clinical space is now able to take on board more patients. This has enabled us to expand  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=206.0_D=24.5_C=0.74] the physiotherapy department so that we can provide more hands-on care to more patients.

I assure the member that there are other hydrotherapy pools in the area, including TLC Aquatics, Healthglo, Taswim and the aquatic centre at Burnie, the Latrobe Council heated pool, the Wynyard Fitness Centre, the Mt St Vincent Day therapy at Ulverstone,  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=231.4_D=4.2_C=0.65] Splash and the Croft Avenue swimming pool at Devonport. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=236.6_D=8.4_C=0.74]  I can assure the member that if therapeutic programs involve warm-water exercise, patients are supported to access these suitable community pools.


 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=251.3_D=17.3_C=0.76] TasTAFE - Automotive Training in Southern Tasmania

Ms BADGER question to MINISTER for SKILLS and TRAINING, Mr ELLIS

[11.00 a.m.]
On 13 March when asked about job losses in TasTAFE's automotive sector, you told this place that staff would be offered voluntary redundancies or be redeployed. That is despite TAFE's documents from February clearly saying that redeployment was not an option. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=269.3_D=29.5_C=0.83]  We understand that half of the southern automotive staff have lost their jobs, including through forced redundancy. Whether you have been misleading or just asleep at the wheel, the devastating impact on staff and the industry is exactly the same. These job cuts are shameful and they raise huge concerns about the future of this critically important training program. 

Is your decision to halve the workforce now the first step in permanently reducing and removing access to automotive training in southern Tasmania?  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=298.9_D=6.0_C=0.85] What exactly are your plans for automotive training in southern Tasmania for 2026 and beyond?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. The answer to your first question is no. We are committed to ensuring that there is automotive training here in the southern region and we are working through that. It has been a difficult circumstance with a burst water main that flooded the lower levels of the Campbell Street campus, including the automotive section. We are continuing to work with TasTAFE and industry on solutions for automotive training [Bookmark: Phr3_O=35.4_D=1.3_C=0.91]  following the closure of that part [Bookmark: Phr4_O=37.1_D=25.1_C=0.86]  of the Campbell Street facility. We need to work through it diligently so that we can continue to provide the services for apprentices and learners in the automotive sector in the south, both in the short term and the long term. We are working through it with learners, teachers and employees affected, as well as the industry, on a hybrid approach to training delivery for the return of learners in 2025. TasTAFE has been engaged with the automotive team with respect to both the delivery models and the resulting staffing impacts as we work through that process. 

You mentioned redundancy. As I updated the House at the time, TasTAFE engaged with the automotive team on a process that was compliant with the [Bookmark: Phr6_O=87.1_D=29.7_C=0.74]  enterprise bargaining agreement. Three voluntary redundancy offers were taken up by staff. Exploring possible redeployment opportunities within TasTAFE forms part of that process, with an assessment of their skills made against vacant position descriptions to see if redeployment is an option. TasTAFE has now finalised a redundancy for one teaching position and we are resizing as required. TasTAFE adheres to the requirements of the enterprise agreement [Bookmark: Phr7_O=117.1_D=27.8_C=0.78] . The resulting staffing levels for the automotive team is six teachers and I understand that TasTAFE advised the automotive team and the union that the process had concluded on Friday 28 March. 

We are committed to working with all of our learners and our staff as we work through this process. For example, current training arrangements look like on-site based training with workplaces, which aligns well, typically larger. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=149.7_D=29.9_C=0.75]  We have been working closely with the Department for Education, Children and Young People (DECYP) on access to trade training centres in Huonville, Bridgewater and other opportunities that might present themselves. With theory-based components, there is appropriate online learning. There are also some learners who will be travelling to the north, just as currently we have many learners from the north and north-west who travel to the south for a range of different courses. 

It is a difficult time. The unforeseen event of the burst water main flood [Bookmark: Phr10_O=180.2_D=29.7_C=0.79] ing the lower levels of Campbell Street campus is a challenge we all need to work through. We want to support our teachers, learners and staff, and the industry so that we can get automotive training back on its feet in the south as soon as we can.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired. 

Supplementary Question

Ms BADGER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary.

Ms BADGER - To clarify what is happening from 2026 and beyond, TasTAFE said initially that the Campbell Street campus would be back up by part-way through 2026. Three weeks later they said there was a site at Rokeby. Which one is it, minister? You said you are also workin [Bookmark: Phr11_O=210.0_D=17.7_C=0.68] g with DECYP to work with the trade training centres, but DECYP has said that the apprentices cannot go there because they do not have a Working with Vulnerable People card. What are you doing to ensure they can actually get it, because it is not a requirement of the course?

The SPEAKER - The original question talked about 2026 plans, minister, so I will draw you to it for that reason. 

Mr ELLIS -  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=230.3_D=29.4_C=0.81] We are working through what those longer term solutions look like. Assessments of the damage at the building have been complex. Flooding in a high rise building is difficult to assess. We are still going through the assessment process for insurance purposes. I encourage members to not play politics with an unforeseen event that is [Bookmark: Phr13_O=260.1_D=14.9_C=0.89]  difficult to work through. We are committed to delivering a solution for automotive training in the south and it is important that we design that right so we get the best outcome for learners.


Energy - Federal Coalition Nuclear Policy

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=276.1_D=15.6_C=0.75] Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.06 a.m.]
You said earlier that you support Peter Dutton's plan for Australia, but Peter Dutton's nuclear plan has the potential to decimate the future of Tasmania's renewable energy investment. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=292.0_D=10.5_C=0.87]  Additionally, the massive uneconomic investment he is proposing will put power prices in Australia up by about $600 per household. Do you support Peter Dutton's nuclear policy?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
———————————————————
Answer to Question - Macquarie Point Stadium - Appointment of Dr Gruen

Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) - In reference to Mr O'Byrne's question, I can update the House very quickly: the Jacqui Lambie Network requested the Gruen appointment on 16 April 2024.

The SPEAKER - Can we stop the clock for that process? The Premier is updating the House on an answer and I do not want it to take the answer time that is allocated to another question. Premier, I will give you the call to do that, because you have started. Normally, it would be at the end. We will start the clock when you have finished updating Mr O'Byrne.

Mr ROCKLIFF - This included principles for the review. Further edits to the principles were provided by the JLN on 17 April. I am advised the appointment was confirmed by media release on 4 May 2024. The National Australia Business Confidence Survey - Tasmania, No. 1, and business conditions, No 2. Thank you very much, honourable Speaker.
———————————————————
The SPEAKER - Restart the clock.

Mr ROCKLIFF - That is fantastic news. Whoever asked that question, that is fantastic. It was really very good.

The SPEAKER - Premier, to the question you have been asked by the Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ROCKLIFF - There was an article published on 6 April in The Examiner. It was written by Joe Colebrook, who I had a quick chat to on Sunday, and it said, talking about Peter Dutton:

A government led by him was "absolutely committed" to the project speaking of which would add a second subsea power and data link between Tasmania and the mainland, via the North-West.

… 

"We were the architects, of course, of Marinus Link, so we remain committed to it, and we will make sure that it's completed. There will be money in the budget for it", Mr Dutton said.

Irrespective of the national energy mix, whether that be renewables - there is currently a lot of coal, gas, nuclear - Tasmania will be a renewable energy state, very clearly.

Dr Broad - Mal Hingston does not mind a nuclear power station.

Mr ROCKLIFF - What?

Dr Broad - Mal Hingston does not mind a nuclear power station.

The SPEAKER - Thank you. Dr Broad, just because the Premier asks you to repeat it, does not mean you are allowed to. It is now on the record. The Premier has the call. You may take a point of order if you wish.

Members interjecting.

Dr Broad - Skippy is back.

The SPEAKER - Dr Broad.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We are a renewable energy generation state. We will always be a renewable energy generation state. Hydro will be the base power and then Marinus will provide us with the opportunity to invest further in renewable energy in terms of solar and wind. I am very pleased with the investments that Hydro are making - significant investments in Tarraleah, which I visited recently.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - West coast as well, which is tremendous, and an example of Hydro and Team Tasmania getting on with the job when it comes to investing in securing our renewable energy resource. It is our government that legislated the 200 per cent by 2040 renewable energy target. 

Mr WINTER - It has not added a single kilowatt of power.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We are working hard to deliver this. Irrespective of the mainland energy mix, our investments and our future will always be renewable.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The Leader of the Opposition will not get his supplementary if people are interjecting on him.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Mr WINTER - Does the Premier support Peter Dutton's nuclear policy? That was the question.

The SPEAKER - I will draw the Premier to the original question. I will remind members on my left that I am actually drawing ministers to questions, so interjecting all the way through is not helpful. 

Mr Ellis - No talk of the Prime Minister's plans. 

The SPEAKER - Neither is interjecting as the Premier walks to the lectern. Minister Ellis, you are now warned too.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I actually admire Peter Dutton for putting it on the national agenda for discussion. I am not sure what your point is, given what I have just said when it comes to renewable energy in Tasmania and our legislated backing of it to 200 per cent. We are making investments in terms of renewable energy in Tasmania, in terms of increasing our Hydro capacity, whether that be Tarraleah or investments in upgrading the turbines on the west coast, and of course the investments we will make when it comes to Marinus as well. We have a very proud history over the course of the last century and we are very fortunate because of our forebears and the investments that governments have made. We have been clear on this. What has been unclear -

Reconciliation Tasmania - State Government Funding

Mr GARLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.12 a.m.]
A budget is all about priorities. Under premier Gutwein, your government made reconciliation with Aboriginal people a priority. Last year, Reconciliation Tasmania, which is a peak statewide body promoting reconciliation in this state, sought funding from the government of $200,000 per year to enable it to develop educational programs that foster knowledge and pride of our Aboriginal history in schools and to run strategic events and educational activities to lay a foundation for understanding and respect in the wider community.

Your government refused this request, which leaves Reconciliation Tasmania as the only state reconciliation council that does not receive any state government funding. This year Reconciliation Tasmania has put in a state budget submission seeking $100,000 to enable it to undertake this work. Is your government still committed to reconciliation, and if so, will you fund Reconciliation Tasmania in this year's state budget?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. We support reconciliation in Tasmania and discussion, learning, healing and education is very important. That is why it was terrific to be at the Palawa Business Hub information session yesterday, and I had the pleasure of launching the Palawa Business Hub in August last year, which we are investing in.

I am aware of the good work of Reconciliation Tasmania. I have had a lot of advocacy across the Chamber when it comes to the crossbench and other members, including your good self, Mr Garland, around supporting Reconciliation Tasmania in this budget. Our minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mrs Petrusma, is also a strong advocate, and while I cannot detail the budget now, we are giving it proper consideration. All will be revealed on 29 May.

CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Recommendations of the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements

Ms BURNET question to MINISTER for the ENVIRONMENT, Ms OGILVIE

[11.14 a.m.]
Given our state, national and global failures to make enough progress on emissions reduction, we are facing the escalating impacts of climate change. One of these is the increase in frequency and severity of disasters. Where is the evidence that this state government has taken seriously the recommendations of the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements, with particular reference to the lack of disaster planning for community health services, including general practice and community pharmacy?

These sectors are primarily funded by the federal government, but disaster planning is undertaken by state governments. Preparedness is key to community resilience both during and after disasters. Where is the detailed planning for general practice and community pharmacy in the case of disasters where power, transport and communications disruptions have occurred.

The SPEAKER - The time has expired for asking a question. I remind members to be a bit quiet when exiting the room. I struggled a little bit to hear Ms Burnet then; hopefully Hansard did not. I remind members that they are not to walk between the person who is speaking and the Chair. 


North-West Tasmania - Crisis Support for Women Fleeing Domestic Violence

Ms DOW question to MINISTER for WOMEN and the PREVENTION of FAMILY VIOLENCE, Ms PALMER

My question is from a constituent in Smithton and it goes across a number of government portfolios. My constituent is concerned about the ongoing lack of crisis support for women fleeing domestic violence in north-west Tasmania. They say that the closest safe space for women without children is an hour away, while those with children must travel at least one-and-a-half hours, assuming they have access to transport to flee in the first place.

For many women in crisis, these distances are simply not viable, leaving them with no immediate safe options. This places them at greater risk and forces impossible choices at a time of extreme vulnerability.

My constituent calls on the government to prioritise crisis and transitional housing in the north-west and ensure that women in all regions have equal access to safety and support, and to provide information on how these critical gaps will be addressed.


Tasmania Police - Number of Recent Recruits

Mr BEHRAKIS question to MINISTER for POLICE, FIRE and EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Mr ELLIS

A constituent in my local community welcomes the fact that 15 new constables have joined the Tasmania Police ranks today, with the recruit course 5/2024 officially graduating. I understand officers will be hitting the beat in Glenorchy and Hobart as well as Launceston, Devonport, Burnie and Bridgewater. You have indicated that we are continuing to recruit record levels of police to protect our communities. Can you please provide a further breakdown of how many officers have been recruited in Glenorchy over the last five years?


AFL Deal Funding

Mr JENNER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

My question comes from a constituent named Susan. She asked: could you please ask how much has been spent on this deal with the AFL to date, including consultants, lawyers, marketing designs? Who is paying for all of this and all the people appointed so far? Are they being paid by the State Service?


Housing - Number of Recent Constructions and Approvals

Ms FINLAY question to MINISTER for HOUSING, PLANNING and CONSUMER AFFAIRS, Mr ELLIS

My constituent, Philip, from Newnham has asked: how many new homes - like, real homes, new homes, actual new builds - have been built over the past five financial years, including the current financial year to date? Can you please break this down separately by private sector and public sector construction, and can you provide the same information but for housing approvals?'


Community Defibrillator Fund - Announcement of Recipients

Mr WOOD question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

I have been contacted by a constituent in Launceston asking when more defibrillators will be made available under our Community Defibrillator Fund. I know that applications under the last round have closed, so can you please provide an update when we can expect an announcement of the successful recipients?

ABEL Energy Letter

MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Salmon Disease Outbreak

[11.21 a.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the House takes note of the following matter: salmon disease outbreak.

The matter of public importance today is the salmon disease outbreak. As summer rolls on into autumn, we know that millions of diseased salmon are continuing to die a horrible death in pens across southern Tasmania. This has been going on for at least three months. Communities in the Huon and the Channel were disgusted and dismayed at  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.1_D=10.8_C=0.78] huge, huge numbers of fatty globules and chunks of salmon and stinking fouled oily water washing up on their beaches  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=36.6_D=20.8_C=0.84] over the summer holidays and at periods where people should have been able to swim safely and enjoy those usually pristine beaches, bays and waterways.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=59.3_D=7.7_C=0.78] People are so connected with the waterways that we are lucky enough to live on. The estuaries and bays are part of  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=67.7_D=29.8_C=0.85] who we are and our water-based activities, particularly over the summer months, define and bring us together. 
People feel abandoned by their elected officials. In my electorate of Franklin, there were huge protests in Verona Sands and a huge community outrage. The people said it was notable; the utter absence of Dean Winter, the leader of the Labor opposition; of [Bookmark: Phr6_O=97.7_D=19.9_C=0.80]  Eric Abetz, the responsible minister; of the independent member, David O'Byrne. Where were they, speaking up for their community? Where were they, talking with concern, asking the questions that were reasonable to ask, about the largest marine bio-security disaster that is still unfolding in Tasmania today?

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=117.7_D=24.2_C=0.85] We have also seen the disaster spreading, as well as the concern from communities, across southern Tasmania into Carlton River and the Tasman Peninsula. Thousands and thousands of Tasmanians have turned up on beaches to draw a red line in the sand and protest what is happening, the lack of strong environmental laws, the lack of government oversight,  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=142.8_D=5.3_C=0.72] the kowtowing to the big salmon corporates by the Liberal and Labor parties, and their turning a blind eye. These people are especially outraged at the predictability of this situation.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=148.7_D=14.3_C=0.85] There are so many questions. We know 6300 tonnes was disposed of in landfill or [Bookmark: Phr10_O=163.6_D=26.1_C=0.78]  rendered into health products, or ended up on restaurant tables and supermarket shelves. We know this now, and government ministers refused to respond in an appropriate way and refused to confirm that indeed, diseased salmon were being sold. This was, however, confirmed and it was drawn out of former Salmon Tasmania spokesperson and CEO Luke Martin.  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=191.7_D=28.8_C=0.84] He did not confirm and would not confirm whether any fish treated with antibiotics also ended up on dinner tables across the country. Many, many people have been approaching me, asking whether there are antibiotics in the fish they are eating. 

I listened to the minister's responses this morning, and I would like him to  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=220.6_D=7.5_C=0.84] answer some more questions because the people will keep being concerned in a vacuum. What we have had is an absolute vacuum from public health on this issue. The minister did say that there are different mandated timeframes required for antibiotic compliance, and he did say the checks are being done, and that they are dependent on different water temperatures. I would like the minister to please table, so that people can understand, the mandated times for different water temperatures for checking our antibiotic levels.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=228.4_D=29.6_C=0.82]  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=258.4_D=29.9_C=0.86] He said audits have been done. I would like him to explain how many audits have been done. Are they done daily? Are they spot-checks that are done by an independent authority? Are they carried out as part of the industry's self-regulation? Can he table the information and make it available to the public? 

We know that Huon, Fortuna, and Tassal are not required to provide information to the public about antibiotic levels. We also know that the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) holds  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=288.4_D=5.0_C=0.78] that information, and when they do they have to make that public. The community needs the information.

Time expired.

[11.26 a.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I am pleased that the Greens brought this up today because it is always good to talk about an industry that supports 5000 Tasmanians. Today, like every other day, is a day where I will speak about it.

I want to reflect a little on what the Leader of the Greens said, but let us face it, I have heard it all before. I have been here for long enough to have heard the same arguments over and over and over. What I had not heard was what I heard yesterday coming from Senator Jacqui Lambie: a senator for [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.9_D=29.9_C=0.68]  Tasmania, a so-called senator for Tasmania on a national platform telling Australians not to consume products from Tasmania. Has this ever been done before by any serious politician in Australia? I would answer no. The Greens may have done it. We expect it from the Greens. I expected the contribution just then from the leader of the Greens. That is what the leader of the Greens says. They do not like jobs, they do not like salmon, they do not like native forestry, they do not like mining: they do not really like anything. They [Bookmark: Phr3_O=61.0_D=28.1_C=0.74]  are opposed to everything.

I am not. I support development, I support jobs and I want to see Tasmania's economy going forward. What I do not support is senators with the misguided, misleading, inaccurate claims that she made on a national platform, telling Australians not to consume products from Tasmania, and then talking about Brand Tasmania. Yesterday, Senator Lambie attacked every Tasmanian worker in that salmon industry. She did not just attack them, she pretended they did not exist. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=89.8_D=8.6_C=0.70]  She claimed that there are not thousands of jobs in the salmon industry. Guess what? There are. It has been proven by Access Economics. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=98.8_D=30.0_C=0.74] 

Mr Abetz - Deloitte's.

Mr WINTER - There is a report out that says there are. Do you know how I know there are thousands of workers?

Mr Abetz - Because you met them.

The SPEAKER - Minister Abetz has an opportunity.

Mr WINTER – It is because I live here, I am here and I represent the Huon and channel area that the leader of the Green speaks about. I have also been to the west coast a lot of times, particularly over the last few years.

Dr Woodruff - You should have the guts to show your face and talk to people.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens, you were listened to in silence. You will do the same courtesy.

Mr WINTER - The Greens like to talk about social licence. I have never seen a stronger social licence than on the west coast for their salmon industry. They support their industry because it keeps bread on the table, it keeps their kids in schools and it keeps [Bookmark: Phr6_O=128.9_D=26.6_C=0.69]  the community alive. To have a senator who is based on the north-west coast attacking those west coasters was disgraceful yesterday. I will stand up here every day and support them.

I have to say, I was sledged by the Premier this morning about whether I had gone cold on supporting the salmon industry, seven minutes after I put a release out saying that we do support it every day. I heard the Premier say he was putting the salmon industry on notice only a few weeks ago. I wonder what he has actually done. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=155.9_D=30.0_C=0.61]  Is he going back to his moratorium on the industry that he had only a few years ago? Is he going to close down those hatcheries that he talked about? Is the salmon plan back on? This is a government that has a salmon plan that is still on the website, still live - as far as we know - that says they are going to shut down the flow-through hatcheries and send our workers further out to sea.

There has been one party that has been consistent in support for the salmon industry over the last few years that has never wavered and never shirked it, and never shirked the challenges that we have from the Greens and now people like [Bookmark: Phr8_O=186.3_D=29.0_C=0.71]  Jacqui Lambie. That has been the Labor Party. 

It was the Liberals who brought up the moratorium to question whether our people were doing world's best practice. Our people do world's best practice. I am not just talking about the workers who are out there on the water working in sometimes dangerous environments to support an industry and their own families in their own communities, but I am talking about the independent scientists who repeatedly get attacked not just by the environmentalists out [Bookmark: Phr9_O=215.8_D=24.4_C=0.79]  protesting, but also in this place. I heard the contributions made by Greens senators who should have known better in the Senate, I watched some of that debate a few weeks ago, who had no idea, who I doubt had ever been to Macquarie Harbour, pretending they were experts on the Maugean skate. They would not know what one looked like. I listened to members of this place questioning the independent science body, the independent EPA - an independent organisation filled with scientists who live in my community of Franklin [Bookmark: Phr11_O=248.3_D=24.5_C=0.80]  who do a great job in overseeing an industry using independent regulation. This is a world-leading industry and they are doing a good job. 

The challenges that we faced over summer are important. I hope that we learn from what happened. I think the industry itself - and no one will deny that what happened over summer [Bookmark: Phr12_O=273.7_D=6.5_C=0.77]  was not what anyone wanted, not what I wanted, not what the industry wanted and not what the community wanted. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=280.7_D=7.5_C=0.72]  Water quality is important to me and my family. We live down at Kingston Beach, and we are in the water almost every day during summer. Water quality is really important [Bookmark: Phr14_O=289.7_D=15.0_C=0.73] . We need to have an EPA that is independent, that is full of great scientists, and we do. We do need to get stronger communications out of the government.

Time expired.

Dr Woodruff - You would not have been swimming if you lived at Verona Sands.

The SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff will cease her interjecting.

[11.31 p.m.]
Ms HOWLETT (Lyons - Minister for Primary Industries and Water) - Honourable Speaker, I am pleased to respond to this MPI on behalf of the government. We continue to acknowledge community concerns about the current outbreak. We also acknowledge the challenging situation that salmon companies have been dealing with due to the high number of fish losses occurring within a short period of time. Fish deaths are a known aspect of salmon farming worldwide, particularly in summer when the weather is warmer and the water temperature higher.

The government has strengthened the Environmental Protection Authority's role as an independent environmental regulator to ensure comprehensive environmental monitoring and regulation of our salmon industry. We understand that while the EPA continues to receive mortality notifications for individual pens, we are advised that mortality rates have declined from their peak and are now in line with historic levels for this time of year.
As the mortality event declines, EPA officers continue to undertake compliance inspections in partnership with Biosecurity Tasmania and local councils. This is not a biosecurity failure. There are strict biosecurity measures in place to minimise the likelihood of the spreading of pests and diseases within and between biosecurity zones. There is also the natural movement of currents, particularly at this time with the extension of both the Leeuwin and eastern currents.

The prevalence of P. (Piscirickettsia) salmonis does not pose a human health or food safety risk. The recent audit undertaken by the federal government's Department of Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry has identified the products are fit for human consumption and no non-compliance was detected. The Chief Inspector of Primary Produce Safety has determined that P. salmonis is not a prescribed disease under the Primary Produce Safety (Seafood) Regulations 2023. This is based on evidence from the Director of Public Health and the Chief Veterinary Officer. I want to reiterate that salmon produced in Tasmania is safe to eat when stored and prepared in accordance with food safety requirements, like we do with all other animal products.

Salmon production has the highest farm gate value for seafood in the latest Agri-Food ScoreCard at 1,366,000, with an export value of almost 300 million. Salmon accounted for 88 per cent of the seafood sector's beach value and 75 per cent of the sector's export value. Salmon aquaculture has become Tasmania's largest primary industry in the 30 years since its induction to the state.

While the Tasmanian salmon industry is comprised mainly of three large vertically integrated companies that grow fish from eggs to harvest and the value add to the final product, the industry also incorporates and supports an extensive range of external businesses, including feed production, pen and net manufacturing, vessel manufacturing, processing, transport and logistics waste disposal, plastic recycling, cleaning, the retail sector, and the science and technology sectors.

Industry recognises that biosecurity is at a critical business risk and proactively managing that risk is vital to its future growth and sustainability. The introduction of the Biosecurity Act 2019 introduced a range of mechanisms designed to support those better biosecurity outcomes for the industry.

The biosecurity programs the Tasmania salmonid industry established under the act are one of these mechanisms. The programs set standards designed to reduce biosecurity risk between growing regions, year classes, operations, and individual farms. The program aims to reduce as much biosecurity risk as practical. The industry is committed to this program to ensure that we have a thriving salmon industry in Tasmania.

I want to reiterate: this government 100 per cent backs the Tasmanian salmon industry, the businesses that invest in Tasmania, and continuing to grow. The processing and the delivering on fish farms from smolt in hatcheries, grown out into marine farms onto family dinner tables, and of course our restaurants -

[11.36 a.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the Greens for bringing forward this important motion and for continuing to shine a light on this unfolding disaster, which neither the government nor the opposition want to talk about. There is something fishy going on in Tasmania with the salmon industry, and I am not talking about the millions of kilos of dead salmon being removed from feedlots around the state. I am not talking about the decaying fish remnants that have been polluting our environment this summer either. I am talking about what the government is doing, or not doing, in response to this crisis.

On 16 January 2025, the Chief Veterinary Officer revoked a declaration under the Biosecurity Act 2019 that listed Piscirickettsia salmonis as a prohibited animal disease. This was a significant step to take. With the prohibited declaration removed, the industry was no longer required to destroy all of the fish in the infected pens. Put simply, it allowed them to legally harvest and sell diseased fish. This change was made without any government announcement, nor any public statements from the industry or the Chief Veterinary Officer. Even as late as March, the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania (NRE Tas) website still recorded P. salmonis as 'exotic', not 'endemic'. That is why on 5 March in this place I asked the government when the testing of the bacteria was finalised and which strain of P. salmonis we were dealing with.

The response to my question, which was taken on notice, stated that:

The Chief Veterinary Officer received the full laboratory results of samples at midday, Friday, 28 February 2025. A complex genetic testing process was undertaken to confirm this information. The results confirm the species is Piscirickettsia salmonis.

I sought further written clarification from the Chief Veterinary Officer and was told that initial diagnosis of P. salmonis in Tasmania came from whole-genome sequencing in early 2024. However, no action was taken to change the biosecurity status of P. salmonis in Tasmania until 16 January 2025, even though the final results were not received until 28 February, and the public was not notified until I raised the question in this parliament on 5 March. The very next day, the Chief Veterinary Officer released his first public statement about this outbreak, seemingly prompted by my question. 

The timing of the change in declaration raises serious questions. Why was the declaration of P. salmonis changed by the Chief Veterinary Officer six weeks before he received the final confirmation of the identity of the bacteria from the complex genetic testing process? Was it because the salmon industry did not want to dump all its diseased stock, so it asked the chief vet to change the declaration? That certainly remains an open and reasonable inference to draw.

I will now refer to a statement by Senator Jonathon Duniam, who seems eager to distract from the mass salmon deaths unfolding in his home state and instead shift attention to Chilean salmon. In an article by David Killick in the Mercury on 1 April, Senator Duniam was quoted as saying:

We all saw what happened this summer when a new naturally occurring disease struck salmon farmers in the south. 

No wonder the public is confused about what is happening with this outbreak and the government's response. The state government and its agencies have been at pains to say this is not a new disease, that it is endemic and has been around since 2021. How is it that the federal shadow minister for Fisheries is claiming something that directly contradicts the current government advice?

I also point out the hypocrisy of the concerns raised by the industry in the same article about the biosecurity risk and risk to human health from antibiotics. This is a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black.

Since 2021, we have seen an exotic species that was declared to be a prohibited animal disease become endemic. We also know that unknown quantities of antibiotics were administered to salmon in the Channel by Huon Aqua in February and again this month.

We do not need to worry about imported salmon riddled with disease and antibiotics. We have those right here in Tasmania. The Premier probably had some for dinner last night and maybe that is why he has not been in the Chamber much recently. 

The SPEAKER - I remind staffers to not walk on the floor of the Chamber.

[11.41 a.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to talk on the Greens' MPI on salmon and comment on the disease that has swept through Tasmania's waterways and killed millions of fish. It is one of the most devastating industrial and environmental failures in recent memory. 
The image of dead fish and chunks of rotten flesh washing up on Tasmania's beaches is not one the public will soon forget, and not one the market should ever forget. There have been 6300 tonnes of fish, at last count, sucked out of industrial fish farming cages, transported to rendering and other facilities, or buried in shallow pits to compost. 

The salmon mass mortality crisis highlights the need for a strong and truly independent Environment Protection Authority. This is not a reflection on the people working at the EPA. This is a reflection on the system, and the EPA's complete lack of teeth and inability to deal with the crisis and challenges facing industry.

The early stages of the crisis were marked by a lack of certainty for the public about whether the EPA or Public Health were adequately managing the disaster. Who was in charge? Who was notifying the public? Why was no message put on TasALERT? 

The Greens have been pushing for EPA independence for many years. Recent reforms have not gone far enough. The minister is still able to influence the EPA through issuing statements of expectations, which the EPA must abide by.

Mr Garland mentioned Senator Duniam. I will mention Julie Collins, the federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, who has also made recent comment on the need to strengthen the Environmental Protection Authority in Tasmania. We agree with Ms Collins one hundred per cent in this regard. We would like to see a similar response from state Labor rather than its current position, which is identical to the Liberals, of total capitulation to the salmon industry.

In order to be an effective regulator, the EPA needs to be completely separated from government and industry. It is unquestionable that the cosy relationship between the salmon industry and the government has been a factor in this most recent salmon mass-mortality event. Mr Garland has just eloquently spoken about that.

Stocking densities, biomass levels and biosecurity restrictions favour the industry above the environment. We have salmon biosecurity zones that do not prevent the movement of vessels or equipment between those biosecurity zones. We know that the salmon bacteria moved from the east coast biosecurity zone to the south-east biosecurity zone, but there is no clarity on how or when that happened. Clearly, our environmental laws and regulations in relation to salmon biosecurity were not strong enough to prevent this outbreak, and we can expect more failures in the future unless we take action.

The Greens acknowledge that the EPA is currently doing the best it can with the hand it has been dealt, but it is underfunded and its remit is unclear. Up until 2008, one of the functions of the EPA board, as stated in the Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Act, was to, 'Protect the environment of Tasmania.' Labor removed that line in 2008 and it has not been put back in. How is it the Environment Protection Authority does not have enshrined in its overarching legislation a requirement to protect the environment of Tasmania? How can our sole environmental regulator not have the protection of the environment as part of its core functions? 

The Greens will continue to call for an EPA with teeth, an EPA empowered and funded to hold salmon companies and other industries that threaten the environment to account. We need to move salmon farming on land. In the interim, to ensure that salmon mass-mortality events do not happen again, we need to ensure that the EPA is a body truly independent from government, including by removing the minister's ability to issue statements of expectations and statements of intent.

We need to reinstate the protection of the environment as a function of the EPA board enshrined in legislation. We need to require membership of the EPA board to include a person nominated by the Aboriginal community to ensure that it is truly representative. We also need to establish principles to be observed, including that the prevention of harm to the environment and human health is prioritised ahead of mitigation or remediation.

There has been much said about this salmon mass-mortality crisis, and it is not over yet so I am sure there is still a lot more to come. One thing we can agree on with the federal minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Julie Collins, is that the EPA in Tasmania needs to be strengthened. She has visibility of some of these issues and is seeing the failure of the local EPA. She has called for those laws to be strengthened and we agree with her on the necessity of that. 

Time expired.

[11.46 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Minister for Business, Industry and Resources) - Honourable Speaker, I welcome the call by the Leader of the Greens for me getting up to speak. Nobody was more devastated by what occurred in the salmon industry than those men and women who work in that sector. That is their life blood, that is their work and what they are doing is producing a protein that is the most carbon-efficient in the world. That is something the Greens will not ever talk about. It is the most carbon efficient way of producing animal protein. That should be celebrated, should it not?

There have been a number of issues raised in this debate. What I would say to the Greens and others is that the easiest thing when there is a difficulty at hand is to grab the microphone and seek to get publicity on the back of it. The harder task is to deal with the issues at hand and see what can be done about it.

The good news in relation to what has afflicted the salmon industry this summer is that through Tasmanian research we believe that we have been able to find a vaccine to inoculate to protect the fish against the disease. What has been done to try to ensure this does not happen again? After a 35-40 year history, as we learn and as things happen, we continually improve and look to protect the fish to ensure that we take the pressure off the wild fishery. That is something else that the Greens refuse to talk about. They also refuse to talk about Chilean imports and the disease that might come in with them. Never a problem.

Let me also remind those who might be listening in that every single item of Tasmanian salmon on our supermarket shelves is dealt with by the Federal Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Export Standards. That is the highest level. With respect to Ms Collins, who is the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, she should, in her statements, compliment her own department and the export authorities who look after these particular considerations.

I will quickly deal with the issue that Mr Garland raised about the changing of the classification. As I understand, the process for reclassifying the disease started over a nine-month period, way before this incident. It was in early April 2024 when this was considered in some detail. Then the Australian Centre - not Tasmanian - the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness advised the support of the findings in late September 2024 - yet again, well before the unfortunate events of this summer. It was this which led to the Chief Veterinary Officer gazetting a proposed reclassification from prohibited matter or exotic disease to a declared disease on 16 January this year. That proposal was published in the gazette on 29 January this year, and afforded a period of 28 days for submission or comment in relation to the proposal. No correspondence was received. Oh, but when there is a breakout, we will grab the microphone and condemn the process. What about responding to the suggestion that was being made? Crickets. Not a word.

Mr Bayley - Did you put out a media release, minister?

Ms Burnet - Hidden in the gazette.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, members of the Greens.

Mr ABETZ - It was accepted. This is a sector that literally employs thousands of people around this state, something which I heard Senator Lambie reject. Astounding. I have happened, I think, to have met personally, at least 1000 of those workers, if not more, as I travel around the state. There are local trucking firms, local electrical firms, local technology firms, all of which get their bread and butter in support of this vital sector. The government fully supports our salmon sector.

[11.52 a.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, it is my absolute pleasure to rise this morning and speak on the salmon industry in Tasmania. It is my displeasure that the Greens would bring an item titled on a very serious matter before Tasmania, and then in the process seek to undermine the incredible people in Tasmania who work in the salmon industry. I love Tasmania and I love the things that we are able to achieve here. I love nothing more than being an advocate and a person who supports great innovation and great people in Tasmania, particularly when it is something that happens in our state and is recognised not only nationally but internationally.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=26.5_C=0.89] I think at moments like this in this place, we need to pause and remember the full context and understanding of the things that we speak about. The best way to do that is to build relationships and gain real information about those that we speak of. The salmon industry in Tasmania, with their decades of advancement in this state from an idea in a small way that has grown over time, has created some of the greatest innovations  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=57.5_D=3.4_C=0.82] undertaken and used across the world that have been developed right here.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=61.4_D=30.0_C=0.88] Tasmania should be proud of this industry, as unfortunate and devastating it is for all people who work in the industry. The circumstances we find ourselves in for this summer, an extraordinary event, the only event of this scale that has occurred in the 35-year plus history of the salmon industry, should always be considered in context.

The Greens and others rise in this Chamber and talk about the confusion in the community about the current status of  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=91.5_D=30.0_C=0.86] this industry. I would say that it is the misinformation shared by the Greens and by others in this place and by people in the community intentionally seeking to undermine the credible reputations of people who work in this industry that leads to community confusion.

You have had two ministers of this place, senior ministers in this government stand up and speak on the record about the information that they received directly from their department, and an absent minister - and I am not saying that negatively -  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=122.5_D=29.1_C=0.86] Mr Jaensch said categorically in this place that Tasmanian salmon on the shelves in supermarkets and in stores across this state and across this country is safe to eat. It is absolutely determined that it is safe to eat. It is a prime quality product of quality protein. As the minister himself said, it is produced in the lowest possible carbon way. It is one of the highest quality proteins. It is  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=151.7_D=29.7_C=0.82] delicious and safe to eat and is produced in a way that does not compare to other proteins, and yet we have people intentionally seeking to undermine that. 

There needs to be certainty in our community. The way that happens is by people actually being honest and telling the truth about the information that they represent in the public conversation. One of the ways that you do that - and I would ask the Leader of the Greens as an example - is to actually go out for yourselves and meet with and be on site at places where salmon is produced.  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=182.1_D=29.3_C=0.84] Has the Leader of the Greens recently taken up an invitation from anyone in the industry to go out and be on-site at actual salmon pens or at any other facilities in Tasmania and met with the workers and spoken to the workers and with industry and seen how it actually happens? No, they would prefer to spread misinformation about the potential of 100 per cent producing salmon on land.

They seek to undermine [Bookmark: Phr9_O=211.6_D=29.4_C=0.80]  - someone talked about stocking densities of the salmon. If the leader of the Greens went out and visited a pen in Storm Bay or anywhere else in Tasmania, you actually stand on the pen and look in the water, you can hardly see the fish. They imply to the people of Tasmania that there are chocked up pens full of fish struggling for position within these pens. The reality is there is between 2 and 3 per cent stocking density in our pens in Tasmania. Those fish are hardly seen there. The pictures, the imagery created by the Greens and the others is that it is chocked up with foul materials and so many fish that none can move. That is  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=241.9_D=29.1_C=0.86] just not the case.

If people like the Leader of the Greens, Senator Lambie, and others actually took the time and accepted the invitations for people to go out and see the incredible operations of these people, meet with the amazing people who have done this work and have created some of the best innovations used across the world, then they would actually  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=271.1_D=26.5_C=0.81] have to tell the truth.

Dr Woodruff - Have you dived under the water?

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Ms FINLAY - They will have seen it for themselves. They are not willing; they are not able. They will not do that because they know then that they cannot continue the misinformation that they continue to spread. The Tasmanian salmon industry is loved by many in Tasmania. The salmon on the shelves is safe. It is a quality product. Tasmanian Labor stand firmly with the salmon industry.

Senate Vacancy Joint Sitting
 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=102.0_D=29.4_C=0.78] 
Honourable Speaker,

The Legislative Council having agreed to the following Resolution, now transmits the same to the House of Assembly, and requests its concurrence therein: -

That on Tuesday, 27 May 2025 at 11.15 o’clock in the forenoon the Legislative Council meet the House of Assembly in the House of Assembly Chamber for the purpose of sitting and voting together to choose a person to hold a place in the Senate of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia rendered vacant by the resignation of Senator Anne Urquhart; and further, the Legislative Council proposes the following Rules for the Joint Sitting:

PARLIAMENTARY USAGE TO BE FOLLOWED IN DEBATE -

That on any Debate arising, the same shall be conducted according to the Standing Rules and Orders of the House of Assembly. On all points of order, and on all questions arising during the proceedings for choosing a person to fill the vacant place in the Senate, the ruling of the Presiding Officer shall be absolute and final.

RULES OF PROCEDURE -

The Presiding Officer shall call for nominations of persons to fill the seat rendered vacant by the resignation of Senator Anne Urquhart. Each nomination shall be in writing, signed by the proposer, who shall certify on the form of nomination that the person so nominated is willing to hold the seat if chosen and is not disqualified from so doing. The proposer shall also certify that the nominee is a member of the Labor Party. Nominations shall be handed to the Clerk, who upon being satisfied that they are in order, shall proceed with the preparation of the ballot paper. In the event that one or more nominees are certified to be members of the appropriate Party, those nominees only shall be taken to have been validly proposed to fill the vacancy, and no names other than theirs shall be included on the ballot paper as candidates for the vacant seat.

If only one person be nominated for the vacant seat, the Presiding Officer shall propose the Question “That (name of proposed person) be chosen to hold the place in the Senate rendered vacant by the resignation of Senator Anne Urquhart and, should such Question be passed in the affirmative, shall so declare.


If more than one person be nominated for the vacant seat, a ballot shall be taken in the manner hereinafter provided to determine which of such persons shall be chosen to hold the vacant place. Each of such persons so duly nominated is hereinafter referred to as ‘a candidate’.

The Presiding Officer shall announce the names of the candidates who have been nominated, and shall then direct that a ballot be proceeded with, after which no other person shall be nominated; and the Clerk shall turn a two-minute sand-glass, to be kept on the table for that purpose, and the division bells of the House of Assembly shall be rung, and the doors shall not be closed till after the lapse of two minutes, as indicated by the said sand-glass. The doors shall be locked as soon after the lapse of two minutes as the Presiding Officer shall think proper to direct, and, unless otherwise ordered, shall remain locked until it shall have been declared in the manner provided in Rule 2 that a candidate has been chosen to hold the vacant place: provided that the Clerk and two Scrutineers may retire from the Chamber in order to prepare the ballot papers, and subsequently, to count the votes.

The Presiding Officer shall appoint a Member of each House to be a Scrutineer to assist the Clerk of the Joint Sitting (herein referred to as the ‘Clerk’) in ascertaining the number of votes cast for each candidate.

As soon as practicable after the Presiding Officer has announced that the ballot will be proceeded with each Member present shall be provided with a ballot paper initialled by the Clerk.


Each Member voting shall forthwith mark on the ballot-paper the order of his or her preference for all candidates, and any ballot paper not so marked shall be rejected as informal.

The Member shall then fold and place the ballot paper so marked in the ballot box.

If there are only two candidates, the Clerk shall report to the Presiding Officer the number of valid votes cast for each candidate, and the Presiding Officer shall declare in the manner provided in Rule 2 that the candidate who has the larger number of votes has been chosen to hold the vacant place.

As soon as it is ascertained that any candidate has obtained an absolute majority of the valid votes recorded by the Members voting, the Clerk shall so report to the Presiding Officer, and the Presiding Officer shall declare in the manner provided in Rule 2 that such candidate has been chosen to hold the vacant place.

If at any stage in the count, two or more of the candidates have an equal number of votes, and one of them has to be excluded, the Clerk shall forthwith report to the Presiding Officer the results of the count at that stage. The Members shall thereupon proceed to a special ballot to ascertain which of such candidates shall be excluded, but so that if there are more than two of such persons with an equality of votes only one shall be excluded.

In all cases not provided for in these Rules resort shall be had to the procedure laid down in the Electoral Act 2004, so far as the same may in the opinion of the Presiding Officer be applicable and not inconsistent with these Rules.

Legislative Council, 
9 April 2025.
CM Farrell, President

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Clerk. 

[12.03 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Well done. I think race calling may be another job opportunity for the Clerk. 

Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the last mentioned message be taken into consideration tomorrow.

I trust that the Treasurer has enough money to buy you an hourglass filled with sand, and that those opposite will declare any conflict of interest in this motion.

The SPEAKER - I believe we have an hourglass that will be sufficient, thank you very much.

Motion agreed to.
MOTION

Budget Management

[12.04 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, a vote will be required. I move -

That the House -

Orders the Treasurer. Hon. Guy Barnett MP to make a statement to the House within 30 days of the release of a Budget Paper or Revised Estimate Report detailing the actions it will take in the following 12 months to meet the targets over the forward Estimates, should the Budget Papers and/or the Revised Estimates Report show the Government has not met or will not meet one or more of its fiscal targets during any of the financial years for which forward Estimates are provided. 

Calls on the Treasurer to fund within the 2025/2026 Budget the establishment of a parliamentary budget office. 

As a matter of urgency, calls on the Treasurer to table in the House a Bill to amend the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act in accordance with the recommendations contained in the 'Eslake Report' “Independent Review of Tasmania’s State Finances”. 

Further calls on the Government to implement by the end of 2025 the recommendations from the Integrity Commission Paper 2: 'Grant Commitments in Election Campaigns' to ensure election commitments of public money are efficient, effective, economical and ethical.

I rise today to speak on a topic that, as is clear from many recent speeches in this place, is of great concern to a majority of my colleagues here. That is the topic of the dire state of Tasmania's public finances.

I will pause here and seek leave to table Mr Eslake's report titled 'Independent Review of Tasmania's State Finances' because it will be referred to frequently during the contribution on this and is referred in to my motion.

Leave granted.

I have circulated that document electronically as it was a large document.

I do not need to spell out the disturbing figures we are all becoming familiar with, such as the $500 million a year we will soon be handing over to manage the $10 billion in debt we will have in a few short years if we do not take immediate action.

I do not mean the kind of action the Premier announced in his state of the state speech in March: the fire sale of public assets and stripping of the public service workforce was precisely the kinds of action the eminent economist, Saul Eslake, warned against taking. The government has largely ignored or, at best, cherrypicked and deliberately misinterpreted Mr Eslake's very sensible recommendations, which included increasing revenue in equitable and sustainable ways through higher taxes and reducing expenditure on unnecessary infrastructure projects. I believe all non-government members of the House are very concerned about the government's response to date on repairing the state's finances. 

I welcome the government's support for measures in the motion moved by another member in this place last week. Those measures will improve the details in the budget papers and Revised Estimates Report. I note the Treasurer's contribution to the motion where he said:

We are looking forward to continuing the good work that we are doing to deliver a better budget environment for Tasmania. The objective is to deliver a strong and resilient economy that will benefit all Tasmanians so we can reinvest in those essential services.

While I am on last week's contribution, I will note the shadow treasurer's contribution. He said:

We need to put some more guardrails in, we need to put some more supports around decision-making and we need to make sure that the budget is managed in a responsible way so that future generations are not disadvantaged. 

He also said: 

A parliamentary budget office would be highly beneficial to our democracy.

I sincerely hope the opposition today can support this motion.

Building on last week's motion, given the dire state of our finances and this government's chronic lack of transparency, we need much stronger action, and we need it immediately and urgently. We need guardrails that give parliament and the public greater oversight over the state budget, and we need more transparency from the government about how it intends to pay for its election and other commitments to force it to make more responsible budget decisions.

Mr Eslake is on the record expressing his profound disappointment with the government's response to his report, and I know he has publicly stated that he hopes the opposition, minor parties and Independents will pursue these reforms on the floor of the parliament with a view to forcing their adoption. This motion echoes Mr Eslake's key recommendations and I thank him for his time and expertise when I consulted him in drafting this motion.

The motion is as follows -

Orders the Treasurer to make a statement to the House within 30 days of the release of a budget paper or revised estimates report detailing the actions it will take in the following 12 months to meet the targets over the forward estimates, should the budget papers and/or revised estimates report show the government has not met or will not meet one or more of its fiscal targets during any of the financial years for which the forward estimates are provided.

Calls on the Treasurer to fund within the 2025-2026 budget the establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Office.

As a matter of urgency, calls on the treasurer to table in the House a bill to amend the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act in accordance with recommendations contained in the Eslake report: 'Independent Review of Tasmania's State Finances'.

Calls on the government to implement by the end of 2025 the recommendations from the Integrity Commission Paper 2, 'Grant commitments in election campaigns' to ensure election commitments of public money are efficient, effective, economical and ethical.

The first point is about the need for the government to get real with the Tasmanian people and the parliament. What we have seen in recent years is this government trying to mislead us and that they have the budget under control when numerous respected economists can see that this is nothing but pure BS - if that is not too unparliamentary.

What this motion does is very simple and should be completely uncontroversial - simply requiring the treasurer to explain to parliament and the public how the government intends to make its fiscal targets where they are not met in the budget or in the Revised Estimates Report.

When we overspend our household budget, we need a plan to get it back on track. That is all we are asking for with this call. If the government cannot commit to this, it is essentially an admission it has given up and that it has no plan. Tasmanians deserve better.

The second call in this motion is the establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Office. Again, this is a simple and sensible measure. A PBO will help members in this place and the other place and the public to make informed decisions about economic policy and the state budget. Importantly, it would help parties aspiring to government and any of us making spending proposals to estimate the financial implications of policy proposals.

It is a lazy response to rule this out because it will incur a cost. Saul Eslake's research on this has shown that there can be relatively low costs to establish on. The three currently in existence, at the Commonwealth level and in Victoria and New South Wales, are instructive. Mr Eslake tells us that the Commonwealth PBO, as you would expect, is the most expensive option with an annual budget of just over $10 million. It has staff of about 45 people and provides analysis and costings of policy proposals on request from senators and members. It publishes information to increase public understanding of the budget and reports after every election to show the budget impact of the election commitments of major parties and of minor parties and Independents who would be included.

The Victorian PBO has an annual budget of $3.3 million and does many of the same things as a Commonwealth Parliamentary Budget Office with about 14 full-time staff, which is boosted in election years.

The New South Wales PBO is a slightly different model. As Mr Eslake explains, it really only gears up in election years and they second staff from state Treasury and, if needed, the private sector, rather than having permanent staff. That may be a more appropriate model for Tasmania, given financial constraints.

I will finish my comment on this part of the motion with Mr Eslake's compelling argument for the establishment of a PBO in Tasmania. He says:

the establishment of a Tasmanian Parliamentary Budget Office would significantly enhance the effectiveness of parliament's role in scrutinising fiscal policy decisions and in promoting more informed debate, both in parliament and within the broader Tasmanian community, of budgetary and fiscal policy issues.

It would assist non-government parties in fulfilling their obligations under the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act 2007, (including the strengthened requirements proposed by this review), and as a result it would likely enhance public understanding of the requirements of returning Tasmania's finances to a sustainable position and maintaining them there. [t

You will note that I have deliberately left this section of the motion open without defining what that Parliamentary Budget Office might look like, because that decision can be made at a later stage.

The third call in this motion is to amend the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act 2007, as set out in Mr Eslake's report. Again, his recommendations are sensible and straightforward. They are to require political parties to indicate how they propose to pay for their expenditure or revenue commitments, or alternatively to state explicitly that they will pay for those commitments by running smaller budget surpluses or larger deficits, and to require political parties to ensure to try to issue their fiscal strategy and costings at least nine days before polling day, and that those fiscal strategies be consistent with objectives agreed to by the parliament and legislated in the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act.

It is hard to believe any responsible government or would-be government would not support these, and if they do not, the public would be right in asking why not.

The fourth and final call on this motion goes to pork-barrelling, one of the most insidious practices undermining our democracy, along with hidden corporate donations for legal parties and candidates. Mr Eslake's report touched on the need to address the seemingly inevitable cash splash every time there is an election. He noted that promises made during the 2018 and 2021 election campaigns each added about $1.4 billion to the budget.

It is imperative that we crack down on pork-barrelling, not just in the interest of fiscal responsibility, but also to start to restore trust in our political institutions. I know that my constituents would work on this.

That is why I was shocked when, in answer to Mr Jenner's question in parliament last month, the Premier did not seem to think there was a problem. When asked whether he would introduce recommendations on pork-barrelling by the Integrity Commission, the Premier said:

In 2014, 2018, 2021 and 2025 we made commitments - local projects - which we will honour as election commitments and that is all that is - members of parliament reflecting the wishes of their community.

In other words, 'Nothing to see here; we will carry on as usual'. This just shows how out of touch he is with public sentiment, which is that pork-barrelling stinks. That is why we are calling for the introduction of the Integrity Commission's 2022 recommendations.

Bear with me as I talk these through. Good process does not always sound sexy, but we need it now rather than empty populist slogans. The key recommendations are:

Introduce legislation to limit cash commitments during elections so commitments of public money are demonstrated to be efficient, effective, economical and ethical, and the terms of these commitments are written down, publicly available and comply with other rules about the use of public funds such as acquitting the funds.

Implement the Audit Office recommendations on the Premier's Discretionary Fund, including setting a funding cap for the fund which can only be exceeded for clearly defined reasons, including in election years.

Introduce formal eligibility criteria for the fund, including:

demonstrated community benefit,

no other available grant programs,

is a one-off payment,

no recent prior funding made for relatively small amounts, for example $10,000; and

requires funding acquittal.

In the absence of urgent and effective action by this government to repair the state budget, this parliament can ensure robust guardrails for the expenditure of public funds, put greater transparency and accountability on that expenditure, and require the government to set out realistic steps for budget repair.

I reiterate: these measures are not radical or exceptional. If implemented, they will simply bring Tasmania more on par with other jurisdictions. It is the least we should be doing and it is the least the public expects.

I will end with the Treasurer's words on the other motion on budget accountability from last week, 'If we can all work together with goodwill, we can get the job done.' I urge you to ensure we get the job done, and I urge members of this place to support this motion. Thank you.

[12.17 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Treasurer) - Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this motion and indicate that we did have a similar motion last week. We outlined to the House then the important work we are doing as a government in terms of budget responsibility and fiscal responsibility, our pathway to surplus, and how serious we are as a government, and myself as a treasurer, in the preparation of the budget on 29 May.

I will share some remarks with respect to each part of the motion that has been put forward by the member for Clark. I thank her for bringing forward this motion. As I say, it is similar in many ways to last week, but I have particular concerns about those last two parts of the motion put to the House.

Before I get into that, I want to provide an update to the House with respect to the business community in Tasmania and the NAB survey - the business survey for Australia - which puts Tasmania on top in terms of business confidence for the second month in a row. I am pleased and delighted with that news. I hope others in this Chamber are likewise pleased and delighted for and on behalf of our business community that they are the most confident in all of Australia.

Second, they come second in terms of business conditions and how they see that in Tasmania: Second in terms of best business conditions for small, medium and large businesses in Tasmania. Thank you to the business community for what you are doing. We are backing you in 100 per cent. We are backing business. We are backing industry. We are growing our economy. We are getting on with the job. That is really encouraging feedback announced just today.

It does not just happen out of thin air. It is because, as a government, we have the policies in place to back our businesses and industries, because we know how important they are for a growing economy. There is one fundamental thing that is really important: you cannot invest adequately in health and education and housing and police, those important essential services, without a strong economy. As a government, we know it is fundamental. It is at the top of our priority list to have a strong economy. That is why our budget on 29 May, which I will have the pleasure of delivering and be proud to deliver, will back in continuing support for our strong economy, backing business and industry and, of course, rendering it able to reinvest in those essential services.

I want to outline and acknowledge the substantial progress our government has already made in embedding long-term financial sustainability, transparency and accountability into the heart of Tasmania's budget process.

Our government's Fiscal Strategy that was introduced in 2023-2024: I acknowledge the former treasurer, Michael Ferguson 2023-2024, who in that budget did deliver on that Fiscal Strategy. This strategy is a comprehensive 10-year plan, not just a short term quick fix - it does not work like that. Everyone knows that in all of my portfolios we have a long-term plan. The fiscal plan is a 10-year plan; it is underpinned by 11 strategic targets designed to build budget resilience, enhance flexibility to build the opportunities for the future and respond to the challenges. This is on the back of COVID-1: more than $2 billion of taxpayer's money invested to save lives, to save businesses, and to save jobs. All in all, that should be acknowledged. 

Second, on the back of the commission of inquiry, there is more than a billion dollars already there in our budget. This is because of four decades of inadequate performance and failures on behalf of past governments and we have made that very clear. Our budgets have featured a backing-in of our infrastructure projects, to the tune of $6 billion over many years, and a commitment going forward.
We want to ensure that our strategy does take into account the economic headwinds and the 12 interest rate rises in the last three years at a federal level under the Labor government.

Member interjecting.

Mr BARNETT - It is absolutely relevant to the federal Labor government, since they have been in office. This inflation is very important; it has a massive influence on interest rates and they have to take some level of responsibility. I hope that is acknowledged by the shadow treasurer when he has the opportunity to share some remarks.

Member interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr Willie, you will have the opportunity to speak.

Mr BARNETT - The budget that I will deliver on 29 May will have an update on the achievement of the strategic actions in our fiscal strategy. That information will be there and I hope that is acknowledged. It will outline a pathway to surplus, which the Premier and I have made very clear. We will be delivering a sensible reform and will continue to do that, and we will resist the burden of increasing taxes on Tasmanians.

That was one of the recommendations of Mr Eslake, which the member has tabled, and that is something that we do not support. I do thank Mr Eslake for his report. I have engaged with Mr Eslake, but we do not support increasing taxes and placing new taxes on Tasmanians or Tasmanian businesses. I do not know if the member supports that part of the report. She has not indicated that, but it would be good to know if that is a position of members anywhere in this place, whether they support increasing taxes, because that is not the way of our Rockliff Liberal government.

We have our agenda of cutting the red tape, streamlining the processes, backing business, and backing industry. We have got the GBE reform process. I thank Saul Eslake for being a part of that: being willing to consult to the Department of Treasury and our government with respect to that GBE reform process. We will get that feedback from Mr Eslake and we look forward to that advice.

That is part of our reform agenda. We will make a big difference because we want those services to be focused on what is best for Tasmanians and to ensure that they are efficient and productive. We have talked about the right size of the public service. We have talked about the importance of efficiencies and productivity improvements. That has not changed. We have a long-term agenda and we will deliver on that. We are not afraid of the reform. The fiscal strategy is a key part of that. I mentioned that last week; I will mention it again now. We are building a strong, resilient economy that benefits all Tasmanians.

We do support greater transparency of the state's finances, including working towards a 10-year projection of net debt and operating the fiscal balance aggregates in the budget papers. I will have more to say on the 29 May when the Budget comes out.

It is hard work putting it all together; there is a lot of work going on behind the scenes, not just with my Department of Treasury, but across the government and of course taking on board the submissions from the whole range of stakeholders, hundreds of them, prior to Christmas. This has been going on for a long period of time.
To the second part of the motion, regarding the parliamentary budget office, Mr Eslake acknowledges that while there may be merit, there are significant costs involved in creating an office with the capacity to be truly effective. I am pleased that the member mentioned some of the other states' and the federal government's parliamentary budget offices, and the costs relevant to each of those offices in their operations. I am aware of a parliamentary committee looking into the merit of a parliamentary budget office, and they are continuing their work. It is a matter of priorities in those costs and where that money is spent.

We have had a shadow treasurer and a state Labor who, for 11 years, have not delivered an alternative budget. This is a shame. The Greens have, to their credit - although it has been described most years as a little 'kooky', in terms of the alternative budget. At least they do it. You do the work and then provide the alternative budget. I look forward to make the call again for Labor to do that. In all that time, they have not delivered one costed policy in opposition. I look forward to that going forward as well.

Regarding the third part of the motion, I want to make it clear that I respectfully disagree with respect to that and the suggestion that the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act 2007 requires the amendment in the terms put forward by the member. The charter already mandates Treasury to prepare long-term fiscal sustainability reports extending beyond the forward Estimates. I indicated last week that I support doing more work there. We are doing more work. Please be patient for 29 May, and then please express your views subsequent to that. That is absolutely fine. I am just indicating there is a lot of work going on to deliver on the objectives of our government. I think that in a collaborative approach, with goodwill, once you peruse that budget with all the related parts of it, you will see there has been a lot of work going on.

We have committed to introducing the 10-year projections of net debt and fiscal balance into the budget papers and enhancing economic analysis in both the budget and the revised Estimates reports. There is more work to do; it is all ahead of us. We do not want kneejerk reactions. We do not want to suddenly try to come up with a quick fix. It does not work like that. That is not in my nature, in any event - certainly as Treasurer, as Attorney-General, as a minister in this government, and as Deputy Premier.

I believe the charter has served successive governments well. I believe it served for a more robust and transparent non-partisan approach. Frankly, I do not think we need more red tape. We do not need extra paperwork. However, we do need good governance, and that is exactly what we are delivering.

With respect to the final part of the motion, I indicate again that it is not something that we can support. The recommendations suggest that applying government grant regulations to election promises in a campaign when the government is in caretaker frankly undermines the democratic process. It is the Tasmanian people who will make that decision during the election campaign and then at the ballot box - whether it is the state election, the federal election, or a local government election, for that matter.

I hope all members of this place recognise and agree that the democratic process is important for all political parties and independent members as they put forward their views, their promises, and their commitments to the electorate. That is fundamental, let me just say. That is a fundamental value that I know I stand on, and others stand on in this place. Taking commitments to an election and giving people the right to vote on those commitments is one of the most transparent processes of all. Tasmanian people will share that view in that ballot box. That is exactly what is happening now in the lead up to the federal election where you can vote early and on the day, Saturday 3 May, and then for the Legislative Council a number of weeks after that in those divisions that are up for election. 

Each party has the right to choose its policies and its platform, and the merit of those election commitments made by the various parties is a matter for voters [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.9_D=29.3_C=0.80]  to judge and no one else. You do not want bureaucrats or members of various government departments reviewing that and providing analysis and assessment of that. It is for the voters to decide, frankly. They are quite capable of forming their own views about the merit, substance, appropriateness, propriety, morality, cost effectiveness and good sense of the commitments that are made. 

There have been a range of commitments that have been made during this election  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.6_D=25.2_C=0.83] campaign. We can say more about the views on sustainable forestry in Tasmania. That is another matter and it affects thousands of jobs, so the position of Labor in that regard is something that they have to stand accountable for. The Premier raised a whole range of other commitments that have been made in the past.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=87.3_D=2.5_C=0.93] I want to quote from the Integrity Commission [Bookmark: Phr5_O=90.4_D=29.6_C=0.81]  paper that was earlier quoted by the honourable member: 

Irrespective of their intent or type, grant commitments made during an election period are only promises. They are subject to the election of the relevant party and are usually formally approved by parliament through an Appropriation Act before they are realised.'

You get to have the vote and then it comes to the parliament, and it is up to the parliament as to whether that is then passed through the parliament in a budget. It is called democracy.  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=120.5_D=7.0_C=0.75]  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=129.5_D=21.2_C=0.85] The party that is elected and forms government have to deliver on that in the parliament; they have to have the numbers to pass that through the parliament to back in the commitment that is made. Unless you win those votes, then frankly it does not happen.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=151.7_D=0.6_C=0.92]  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=154.6_D=29.3_C=0.82] In conclusion, I indicate that yes, I think we have already come a long way. We have done a huge amount of work. We have progressed substantially and there will be a lot more said on 29 May when I deliver the budget for and on behalf of this government. We cannot support the motion. I have raised particular concerns on points three and four; I wanted to draw that to your attention.  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=184.1_D=13.9_C=0.92] 

I agree and am happy to be quoted in terms of collaboration and goodwill, and I hope that will continue across this parliament. We are a minority government but we want to get things done, we are getting things done, and we will get on with the job.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=198.9_D=29.4_C=0.83] In conclusion, I recognise Tommy Quick.

The SPEAKER - I was about to do that myself. 

Mr BARNETT - Thank you very much - and Rina and Clive. It was wonderful to catch up with them yesterday and I know they are catching up with other colleagues here. I will leave the Speaker to say a little bit more shortly but yes, it was great to catch up yesterday and it is wonderful to have them in the Chamber today. I thank the House and I hope you take all those things into account.

Recognition of Visitors

The SPEAKER - Before giving the call, I hope members will indulge me to formally recognise  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=228.5_D=30.0_C=0.69] Tommy Quick and his parents Rina and Clive in the gallery today. Tommy will be out on the lawn at 1.00 p.m. for people to come and visit. He has ridden all over Australia raising the awareness of stroke and young stroke survivors. He is on his 3 Points of Tasmania tour. He has been up to Larapuna/Eddystone Point and he is on his way to Cockle Creek. It is really lovely to have you all here today and I hope members are able to be supportive. With that, I will give the call to the shadow treasurer, Mr Willie.

Members - Hear, hear.
———————————————————
[12.36 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=258.6_D=3.0_C=0.58]  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=265.3_D=24.0_C=0.80] Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I will start by thanking the independent member for Clark for putting this forward. I point out that there are independent members, at times, who try to claim the moral high ground and say they are above politics when they demonstrate from time to time that they are not.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=290.2_D=6.3_C=0.86] We had the member who, as far as I know, has not asked any questions about the budget  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=297.4_D=7.6_C=0.81] since the election, come into this place and put forward a suspension of Standing Orders motion to debate this motion. She was unable to convince the House of the merits of that. She then went out on the lawns and misrepresented the vote, making out like the substantive motion had been voted down when that was incorrect. It was pure politics at play.

She is a person who likes to claim the moral high ground from time to time. I will also point out that we had a very sensible motion before the House last week from the independent member for Franklin, and the member did not make a contribution to that motion. I monitored this through the debate. She was not even in the Chamber for the debate. She marches in here and says that something is urgent, condemns people for not voting for the suspension of Standing Orders and does not even contribute to a debate with sensible measures like the motion put forward by the Independent member for Franklin.

I wanted to point that out at the start of my contribution, because they are the facts. That said, I am happy to make a contribution on this motion because it is a good motion. I stand by the words I said in the debate last week - we do need more fiscal guardrails and the trajectory that we are heading under this minority Liberal government with regard to the state's finances is not sustainable.

They have mortgaged the state's future in the way that they have managed the state's finances. They like to say that the debt is manageable and that they have some mythical pathway to surplus without showing any evidence of that. They actually need cash surplus to stop the debt spiral. They have tried to maintain that position for some time. I actually thought they were going to try and maintain that for a bit longer. I thought that they might have tried to get through this year and potentially called an election before they had to deliver another budget last year. 

That is why I took my job very seriously. I had to hold them to account for the way that they have mismanaged the state's finances. I had to make the consequences of doing nothing worse than taking action. We have seen in recent times that, while trying to maintain that the debt is manageable and that they have got a mythical pathway to surplus, the Premier marched into this place at the start of the year and said that he has effectively bankrupted the state and there is a fire sale of government assets.

He did not come to parliament with a couple of formed-up proposals to try and sell the benefits of it. His message to Tasmanians was, 'We need to pay down debt and everything is for sale apart from the Hydro'. It was extraordinary, and he is yet to work through that agenda. We know that there is no pathway through either House of parliament, both of which have expressed their very strong opposition to privatisation. That is some of the background to this.

With regard to the fiscal targets, which is one element of this motion, the government did implement a new fiscal strategy in 2022-2023. It was the former treasurer who did that, and he was very proud of it at the time, but they are effectively in breach of nearly every fiscal target in the budget, whether it is this financial year or through the forward Estimates.

Having some additional accountability and having to explain how they are going to get things back on track is a really important measure. It is not only me as shadow treasurer who thinks that. We had the credit rating agencies in recent times, Moody's and S&P, downgrade Tasmania's outlook from stable to negative, and some of the comments that they were making when they did that was that the fiscal strategy - I am paraphrasing; this is not verbatim - was effectively not worth the paper it was written on, because there was no budget discipline and it looked like there was no intention of the government to actually follow the fiscal strategy.

Having some extra reporting requirements around that can only be of benefit, and we know the most significant fiscal strategies that they are in breach of and will continue to be in breach of for some time are the strategies around debt control.

The debt is in freefall. It has not stabilised as much as they would like to tell you, and it is actually a lot worse than what is in the budget papers because they have been dodgy accountants with regard to government expenditure growth, not accounting for things like health expenditure. We saw that in the Revised Estimates Report where they accounted for growth in healthy expenditure for this financial year and they left it empty for the next three years. It was effectively a billion-dollar hole. I strongly support that measure.

In terms of the Parliamentary Budget Office, that is Labor policy. We announced that last year. We had a 10-point plan for budget repair. Implementing a Parliamentary Budget Office was part of that. There are some process issues here, and the member knows full well that the Public Accounts Committee has launched an inquiry. The member for Clark over there is part of the Public Accounts. That committee is actually looking in detail at what might be the right model for Tasmania. It has done some research. We have gone to the mainland, engaged with the Australian federal jurisdiction, the PBO there, which is the largest in the country, obviously. I think they get up to about 54 FTEs - the member for Clark might correct me there - in the height of an election campaign. There is a significant resource there.

It has earned a reputation. I think it was implemented maybe 2012. I will have to look that up. It is around that time. It has been in operation for a decade or so. They have earnt a reputation over that time for being a credible organisation that adds to fiscal debates and parliamentary democracy. That is exactly what these parliamentary budget officers do.

We went to New South Wales as well. They have a different model there. Theirs collapses outside of election periods. They can do that because they have fixed parliamentary terms and it is easy to predict when the next election is going to be, and they scale up the office. They have also had the good fortune of having a professor at ANU, Professor Bartos, who has been the Parliamentary Budget Officer for the last two or three elections. There is obviously a lot of corporate knowledge there in terms of establishing the office each time and being ready for the election. Victoria has a permanent Parliamentary Budget Office and some history around that. I found engaging with them very valuable. We were provided quite a bit of information.

For members who might not know what a parliamentary budget office does, it is independent financial organisation, and they do things like policy costings and budget analysis. They prepare high quality policy costings and budget analysis at the request of parliamentarians in a timely manner, and develop and maintain costings and projection models and databases. Sometimes, depending on the scope of the Parliamentary Budget Office under legislation, they can publish research papers, through self-initiated activity, that promote better public understanding of the budget and fiscal policy settings, with particular focus on the sustainability of the budget over the medium term. Something that they are well known for is looking at election commitments. They do a post-election report. They prepare and publish a report analysing budget impact of the election commitments of parliamentary parties after the next election.

Not only do we have three jurisdictions in Australia with parliamentary budget offices, across most of the developed world they are starting to implement these parliamentary budget offices in their democracies, because it has been seen as overwhelmingly beneficial.

We have the Public Accounts looking at this sort of stuff, and we have the member coming in here with the motion saying let us make the government do it straight away. I think there is some work there that the committee is doing that would be beneficial to the government. I would expect the government to potentially have a look at that work when it is finished.

In terms of the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act 2007, I will point out to the Treasurer, all it does is call on you. It does not order you to do these things. It calls on you to do that. You have talked about a spirit of collaboration - because you are in minority. There is some flexibility there in terms of the Eslake Recommendations too. He talks about five to 10 years, which is quite a significant period of time, in some of his recommendations. You could potentially work with members of parliament to see how you could achieve the intent of that that that would be acceptable to the government, rather than just dismissing it. Saul Eslake's recommendations are largely consistent with what is actually in the budget. I did think the Treasurer might be concerned about the own-source revenue part of Saul Eslake's report. I will make it very clear here. We do no support tax increases or new taxes. I know the government has tried to run fear campaigns about that; unsuccessfully because there is no evidence. I will make that very clear. In the government's budget, it actually has, on page 50 of Budget Paper 1 some commentary around own-source revenue. It says:

… it is important for Tasmania’s Budget independence and service provision that an appropriate capacity to generate own source revenues is maintained. The 2032-33 Target represents the average of the ten years prior to 2023-24 (the first year of this Fiscal Strategy).

Variation in this measure can be impacted, on a year-by-year basis, by factors outside of the Government’s control. Over the 2024-25 Budget and Forward Estimates the Government will target an average of greater than 37 per cent of own-source revenue as a percentage of total expenditure.

I believe that all governments should unashamedly be trying to grow the economy, which helps grow own-source revenue. It means the government is more in charge of its own destiny. We know in this budget, 65 per cent of the revenue came from the federal government. I would expect this government and future governments wanting to grow own-source revenue to grow the economy, and make sure that we have more controls over our own destiny. That is very important.

A fact I have pointed out in this House before is if you are so reliant on revenue from the federal government, you actually have to be responsible in what you spend. There is 65 per cent of the revenue coming from the federal government. It means you actually have to have budget discipline and be responsible. If things get out of shape, it is very hard to turn it around. That is exactly what this government has done, despite some of the rhetoric.

There are some comments around that. I have put that on the Treasurer. It calls on you to do that. You have a spirit of collaboration because you are in minority. Perhaps, you could have another look at this. There is some flexibility there around Saul Eslake's recommendations in the time period. Some of it is consistent with your own budget. I have just read out a passage from Budget Paper 1, so I will just finish that there.

In terms of pork-barrelling, this is the party at a federal level of sports rorts and car park rorts. At a state level, they have been compared to that national scandal that was exposed by the Auditor-General's office. We have had integrity experts say that their local Communities Fund process that they embark upon in recent elections is like sports rorts on steroids. I cannot remember the gentleman's name. The member for Clark might be able to help me. Was it Geoffrey Watson who is the integrity expert?

A member - Yes, Geoffrey Watson.

Mr WILLIE - I believe it was he who was asked to comment about the setup of this government and said that it was, 'Like the sports rorts program but on steroids'.

I do not know what there is in a proper assessment process to be feared. It is part of our policy to do this. We are talking about community grants here. If the project stacks up and it is beneficial to the community, it will pass the assessment process. It is very simple. When the opposition leader announced that we would ban that form of pork-barrelling through legislation if we form government, the fact that this government has railed against that has told Tasmanians everything they need to know about this government's integrity.

In terms of the Treasurer's explanation today that, 'It is a rigorous process. It comes to parliament and parliament gets to vote on it' - I think he has forgotten that he is in minority. He was effectively saying, 'Well, if you do not like it, block supply, bring us down'. That is what he was advocating for, 'If you do not like our pork-barrelling, vote against it', knowing full well that they are in minority and what the consequences of that would be. It is a ridiculous position that he is trying to advocate for there. I do not know what the fear is on that side. Perhaps it is because they have made an art form of this in recent times. We know the trajectory of the state's finances under this government are entirely down to their policy settings and this is the sort of attitude that has caused some of it. So that, I can outline, banning pork-barrelling and rorts to stop taxpayers being ripped off is Labor policy. We will pass a law to make sure all government grants go through a rigorous assessment process. There is nothing to fear from that. Those politicians and local members championing projects in election campaigns will need to do their work but if they do, and the project stacks up, there is nothing to fear there.

It is not surprising that this government is railing against that measure. I would encourage this government to maybe have a think about that as well, because we cannot keep doing what we are doing as a state. It is not sustainable. They have mortgaged the state's future. In the last year of the forward Estimates, in their own budget, there is $500 million of debt-servicing costs. That is not to pay down debt; that is just to service the debt for one year. That debt has not stabilised; that servicing cost is going to keep growing. We are heading into a place where Saul Eslake, at his last presentation at the university, said that Tasmanians are going to get hurt because of this government's decisions, because of the state of the budget.

Those are a few of my thoughts on the notice of motion before us. I know there are some other members who want to make a contribution, too, and we are short on time. I can indicate that we are supportive of the motion and I look forward to other members' contributions.

[12.54 p.m.]
Mr JENNER (Lyons) - Deputy Speaker, I would like to address what the Treasurer said about taxing: I do not think there is anyone in this chamber who is looking at taxing the public, and nothing is in this motion to say that. I believe it is crucial to help secure Tasmania's financial future for each of these motions. The independent member of Clark has brought the motion forward because it is necessary. The government cannot continue to put the blinkers on and pretend everything is fine because it is not.

Tasmania has delivered a large crossbench in the last election for that very reason: they are fed up with the government's lack of transparency and accountability. The truth is we are deeply, precariously financially positioned and the government's current policies will not get us back on track. That is the reality, plain and simple. This motion will push the government to face reality, rein in its spending ahead of the oncoming budget, and overhaul its financial policies to reflect the seriousness of the economic challenges we are facing. We cannot, as Ruth Forrest said, continue to sleepwalk into disaster.

I am conscious that everybody else wants to talk. I will just concentrate on points three and four; however, every point in this motion is crucial. According to Saul Eslake's report, the key drivers of Tasmania's worsening debt is the government's excessive capital expenditure. Comparatively to what has been embarked on, it is the largest infrastructure spend of any other state in the nation, and we just do not have the funds to do it. Eslake noted that the simple way to begin reducing the accumulative debt is by cutting back on infrastructure spending. I understand that it will always be necessary to spend on infrastructure, as in crucial things like roads, hospital and bridges. However, the government needs to start prioritising these.

Without the substantial reforms, we are facing an annual cash deficit of nearly $1.3 billion over the next decade, with a net potential of exceeding $16 billion. This is more than 25 per cent of the growth state product, and that is obscene, particularly as the state has only got just over 500 000 people. 

The pork-barrelling: I have spoken about this before. For far too long, the government has allowed unfettered access to public money to try and win a vote in an election. The Eslake report revealed the shocking state of Tasmania's finances, ultimately pointing to the gross mismanagement of the budget during the Liberal Party's tenure. Eslake found that unfunded election commitments have a significant contributor to the deterioration of the Tasmanian fiscal position since 2018. This is a particularly disturbing element of the report, one which the government has made no steps to rectify. Over the past three elections, based on the Treasury's advice, by the Liberal Party's own admission, the taxpayer has footed the bill for over $4 billion worth of election promises; that is $1.4 billion per election. These include grants to committees that blur the lines between public interest and party-politics interest, effectively amounting to blatant vote-buying, the message to the public being: 'Vote for us and we will fund your project.'

The problem is the money does not come from the party or the party's resources, it comes from the public purse. The Integrity Commission has examined the issue extensively following complaints about Liberal Party election promises in 2018. The first paper that named the issue of indirect electoral bribery was known as Pork Barrelling Tasmania. It described indirect electoral bribery as a promise or a given benefit to a small localised group of electors to buy their votes and said why this was really criminal. It would not usually amount to misconduct, it was questionable, ethical, and posed a significant threat to the public confidence in the government.

In 2022, the commission released the second paper directly examining grant commitments in the election campaigns. It found that there were no mandatory rules applying to the public servants in assessing the administration of such grants beyond the Treasury guidelines, and no rules at all applying to ministers. The commission focused on a list of $21.4 million of these regional grants that were announced two days before the election.

It found the grants selection process fell far short of good management and principles, accountability, openness, fairness and value for money. This was because there was no identifying objective, there were no selection criteria, there was no application process, the grants were not publicly advertised or competitive, they did not identify the decision-maker, and there was no public record of how the recipients were chosen. In other words, they were allocated to the whim of the Liberal Party.

The Integrity Commission recommended that before the 2024 election, Tasmania should consider adopting the Commonwealth provisions for grant programs where there are rules that do apply to ministers as well as public services. That recommendation fell on deaf ears. In 2024, the state election proved once again the Liberal Party's approach to vote-buying in the public expenses had not changed one bit.

Thanks to the ABC News, which found the leaked document relating to the community project election commitment form that was given to candidates during the campaign this two-page document, Liberals 2030 Strong Plan, exposed the party's blatant disregard for good governance principles, outlines in the Integrity Commission, and its rush to misuse public funds.

MOTION

Budget Responsibility

Resumed from above.

[2.30 p.m.]
Mr JENNER - Honourable Speaker, in an ABC report, the director of the Centre for Public Integrity, Geoffrey Watson said of this Liberals election commitments submission form, 'This is pork-barrelling plain and simple.' That is what it is. When you are allocating money in the heat of a political campaign, that is pork-barrelling. If it was good policy it would have happened during the period of government, not a period of campaign. In other words, public money will be put where it can win most votes, not where it will be best for the public. 

This is public money. The way it should be allocated is under a well-designed program which is thorough through and through. Stakeholders should know in advance, have involvement and there should be independent advice. This is a precisely why the government must implement all the recommendations from the Integrity Commission's report. It is clear that the Liberal government will not stop using public funds to try and buy votes and win elections. 

Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to speak in support of this motion. There have been many calls in this House since the Eslake report was published in August last year for the government to implement some of Mr Eslake's suggestions. I have been staggered at the deafening silence from the government in response to that report, but there is a pattern here. The arrogance and ignorance this government shows is breathtaking. Their steadfast refusal to listen to experts speaks both to their arrogance and their ignorance. This is why we, as a parliament, must step up and force the government to act on the recommendations from Mr Eslake, lest we condemn future generations to have to service the extraordinary debt this government has left them.

Those who listened to my inaugural speech will know I do not come to this parliament with a university degree. I do not have a professional background in economics. I am a fisherman. However, through this role, I am expected to make decisions that impact the economic future of everyone in this state. Some might say I am ignorant, and I guess on fiscal policy I would agree. I am not arrogant, though, because unlike the government, I am happy to seek out the advice of experts. I thank Mr Jenner, Mrs Pentland and Mrs Beswick for securing a deal with the government that resulted in the Eslake report. I found that report to be immensely helpful as I wrap my head around the state of finances in Tasmania.

I will speak specifically to the establishment of the Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO). The best explanation for the need for and importance of a PBO comes from the Treasurer himself. I will read from his second reading speech to the Commonwealth parliament in 2010, when he introduced the Parliamentary Budget Office Bill 2010. On Thursday 24 June 2010, then senator Barnett said:

I rise today to introduce to the parliament a bill for an act to establish a Parliamentary Budget Office and for related purposes. The need for the PBO arises from reckless and wasteful spending we have seen and continue to see from the Rudd Labor government. Labor's debt and deficits, questionable budget accounting assumptions and billions of dollars in government financial waste demonstrate the need for independent scrutiny. Labor has wasted billions of dollars under the Building the Education Revolution - 

Time expired.

The SPEAKER (Ms O'Byrne) - I am loath to do this because it is quite fascinating, but I am afraid that the time for your contribution has expired, unless somebody wants to move to extend. The question is that the motion be agreed to.

Renewable Energy Projects

[2.41 p.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I will require a vote. This afternoon, I rise to move -

That the House -

Agrees climate change is a significant national and global issue, and Tasmania needs to develop new renewable energy to power Tasmanian industry, create jobs, support the electrification of the vehicle network and contribute to national efforts to reduce carbon emissions. 

Supports the construction of new windfarms at Robbins Island, Whaleback Ridge and in other areas of Tasmania, including offshore, as well as projects to produce e-fuels. 

Recognises Marinus Link and both stages of the North West Transmission Development are essential infrastructure if Tasmania’s major renewable energy projects are to proceed. 

Further supports the Albanese Labor Government’s Rewiring the Nation policy, and recognises its critical role in funding essential transmission projects like Marinus Link and the North West Transmission Development. 

Does not support any policy that would cut the funding for Marinus Link or the North West Transmission Development, and in doing so cause the cancellation of tens of billions of dollars of new renewable energy projects in Tasmania.

Does not support any policy that would cut the funding for Marinus Link or the North West Transmission Development, and in doing so cause the cancellation of tens of billions of dollars of new renewable energy projects in Tasmania.

Deputy Speaker, there is no guessing the position of Australian Labor and Tasmanian Labor backing in Tasmania's renewable future. However, recently, reckless announcements from the Australian opposition, backed in by the local state Liberal government [Bookmark: Phr3_O=55.3_D=3.4_C=0.80] , call for critical investments in Tasmania to be put at risk. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=59.3_D=29.8_C=0.86]  Mr Dutton announced the withdrawal of support for Rewiring the Nation, announced the withdrawal of the hydrogen production tax credits, put at risk significant investments in Tasmania, which puts at risk the economic future of this state and puts at risk businesses large and small, and families and communities, by the reckless announcements he has made.

Our intention today is to ensure that it is clearly on the record where this parliament sits [Bookmark: Phr5_O=89.5_D=25.4_C=0.79] , where we, Tasmanian Labor, as a Tasmanian opposition sits, but most importantly, where the government sit on these critical issues.
Extraordinarily, this morning we heard the Premier say he admires Mr Dutton for his nuclear agenda. We know that the nuclear agenda put forward by Mr Dutton absolutely puts at risk the renewable future for Tasmania. In Tasmania, the amazing, proud history and legacy of Tasmania's electrification of our hydro industrialisation has been put at risk by 11 years of inaction by this government, by the inability of this government to do anything. When that is coupled by the reckless abandon of the federal opposition to cut the critical funding needed to actually secure the next 100 years of investment in renewable energy in Tasmania, we need to know where this government sits. 

Recently, Mr Dutton announced that  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=150.1_D=29.7_C=0.85] he would cut the hydrogen production tax credits. We know that doing so puts at risk critical projects in Tasmania. A letter from Abel Energy was tabled in the parliament today demonstrating exactly the impacts that occur from this sort of recklessness. For the benefit of the House, for those people listening, and for Tasmanian communities who have been frustratingly waiting on this government to be able to bring investment into Tasmania,  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=179.9_D=15.3_C=0.85] I am going to read this letter into the House. It is really important. It is from Bell Bay Power Fuels, ABEL Energy, written today to the Leader of the federal Opposition, Mr Dutton:

Over the past five years, ABEL Energy has been working with the Tasmanian government and local communities  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=195.3_D=30.0_C=0.84] to build Australia's first green methanol plant. Methanol would become the long distance shipping fuel of the future with increasing demand as the European Union, other governments and the international shipping industry seek to reduce carbon emissions. We are close to bringing it all together with final engineering designs. The proposed methanol plant would be the largest manufacturing investment in real terms in Tasmania in the past 50 years and a significant driver of economic development, $4 billion in northern Tasmania.  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=225.4_D=29.0_C=0.85] It would employ 500 people in operations and 1,500 in construction. 

The project has attracted the strong interest of European and Japanese shipping companies who will pay remunerative prices under long-term contracts. Northern Tasmania has great advantages in this new manufacturing industry because of its hydroelectric power alongside other renewable energy and its abundance of biomass from local plantations. Our large plant will be followed by others using the region's natural renewables and timber resources.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=254.9_D=29.6_C=0.83] Beyond immediate employment, the project promises intergenerational benefits by fostering advanced manufacturing and creating a new generation of skilled trade and engineering jobs in Northern Tasmania. 

The Bell Bay Power Fuels Project represents a pivotal step towards establishing Australia as a leader in low carbon liquid fuel production on a global scale, providing sovereign fuel manufacturing capability that is crucial for our national security and economic resilience. 

The economics of the project, first of a kind in Australia and advanced in the world,  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=284.6_D=20.3_C=0.76] are strongly assisted by the Commonwealth hydrogen production credits and other support for new industries. The Bell Bay Power Fuels project is set to receive from the hydrogen credit alone approximately $150 per tonne of green methanol, which is a critical factor to ensure a level playing field with competing projects in the United States, the European Union, and elsewhere. Tasmania can out-compete all other places on a level playing field. 

I note your statement of intention to repeal the hydrogen credit and withdraw other support for new zero-carbon industries under current Commonwealth policy. The repeal of the hydrogen production tax offset and other support under established policies would jeopardise this transformative project, undermine our efforts to transition to a sustainable energy future [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.9_D=14.6_C=0.87] , and diminish our competitive edge in the global market. I am sure that you would not intend those negative consequences for northern Tasmania. I seek your assurance that any changes in policy will not apply to Bell Bay Powerfuels. Without that assurance [Bookmark: Phr3_O=44.7_D=29.4_C=0.83] , we will have to pause work on the project at this critical time. Our work has had the strong support of Liberal candidates in the local and adjacent electorates. 

Off the letter here: the Tasmanian government and local governments and communities have been tested today and are not so clear. Back to the letter: 

I urge you to commit to protecting the Bell Bay Powerfuels Green Methanol Project from any policy changes that would prevent its successful implementation. This project is not just about economic growth. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=74.2_D=30.0_C=0.87]  It is about securing a sustainable and prosperous future for Tasmania and Australia. Thank you for your attention to this critical matter.

Extraordinarily, this letter came today on the back of announcements from Mr Dutton about ripping away the funding for the Hydrogen Production Scheme. We know that Australian Labor has worked so hard to ensure the existence of frameworks supporting renewable investments not only in Tasmania but across the country. Labor has been a leading force in [Bookmark: Phr5_O=104.3_D=19.8_C=0.80]  that transition, and the only state that can lead this absolutely is Tasmania when backed in by national and state governments who are in action and doing the right thing.

The greatest risk to Tasmania is a premier who backs in Mr Dutton's energy future, a Premier who is proud of, [Bookmark: Phr6_O=125.8_D=10.2_C=0.85]  admiring of, Mr Dutton's nuclear future plans. This puts at risk Tasmanians' investments and Tasmanian jobs. We know that the whole system of energy in Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr7_O=136.4_D=29.9_C=0.89]  requires people to be investing and supporting those investors and those projects here that can continue to shape the renewable energy future for Tasmania for 100 years or more.

We have significant wind farm projects. We have significant load projects like HIF and ABEL. We have significant existing businesses wanting to expand and employ more people but cannot because they cannot get access to the power they need. We know that future electrification, the future support of the vehicle network, will [Bookmark: Phr8_O=166.4_D=27.1_C=0.83]  require more renewable energies in Tasmania but this government and the federal opposition will put that all at risk if they do not continue to be upfront with the Tasmanian community and honest about their lack of willingness to support those investments in Tasmania. What we have seen over the last 11 years in Tasmania is a government that talks the talk but cannot deliver. It has taken so long to get projects  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=194.4_D=5.4_C=0.80] only minutely progressed in their pathways towards approvals in this place.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=200.2_D=29.9_C=0.83] Whaleback Ridge on the west coast of Tasmania is a case in point. It took years to get permission to enter an approvals process, and it is still now waiting excruciatingly for a conditional stage lease to continue their work. Robbins Island is another: it also took years to go through their processes and now still with uncertainty from the minister right here, who has not been able to solve any of the coastal challenges presented by that project. That sits squarely at the feet of this state minister who is clearly either out of his depth or not willing to progress the essential projects needed in Tasmania. Likewise, we have Marinus Link and the North West Transmission Developments.

This morning, both the Premier and the minister were asked repeatedly about critical infrastructure on North West Transmission Developments, and in their responses they were quiet on this topic. We have a minister who just recently questioned and raised in the community an uncertainty about the government's commitment to North West Transmission Developments. We already know there is a problem with the critical [Bookmark: Phr12_O=260.3_D=29.7_C=0.75]  infrastructure; if Whaleback and Robbins can actually get through the government's processes, and be supported and start construction, they have nowhere to plug in. This is just like a government that has built boats but has nowhere to berth them. 

That is the story of this government, now being in parallel with an Australian opposition in the form of Mr Dutton, that seeks to undermine the beauty of the resources in Tasmania and the legacy of the resources in Tasmania to deliver a renewable future [Bookmark: Phr13_O=290.1_D=14.9_C=0.88]  by admiring Mr Dutton's nuclear plans for the future. It is not just the government that undermines the potential for a renewable future in Tasmania, but extraordinarily the Greens who claim to be all about climate futures and all about supporting the environment. The biggest risk to the environment is climate change. The biggest supporter for climate change in Tasmania is the onset of renewable projects. Yet at every turn, the Greens in Tasmania seek to undermine and not support critical renewable projects in Tasmania, whether it be Marinus Link, North West Transmission Developments, wind farms or other projects; it always blows my mind that the Greens keep getting in the way of a renewable future in Tasmania. 

What do we have here today? We have a Tasmania built on a legacy, communities built on an incredible effort to build this renewable future for Tasmania, and we have a government and the Greens that always get in the way of achieving that.

In our own community, we have had [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.4_D=28.1_C=0.82]  the letter tabled today from ABEL Energy. There have been a number of international entities attracted into Tasmania to invest and continue the great work that happens here right now, entities that have been attracted through prospectuses promoting an abundance of water and energy. The only project that remains standing in the Bell Bay District at the moment is ABEL Energy.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=89.0_D=3.1_C=0.81] The reputation of Tasmania has been tarnished by this government [Bookmark: Phr5_O=92.5_D=30.0_C=0.88]  that attracted investment with terms that were not true and things that were not ready when they said they would be; by attracting people who spent millions of dollars preparing for a potential investment here, but who eventually turned away because of frustrations with this government. We have had Woodside, Origin, Fortescue; all gone out of Tasmania. These were businesses that could have provided jobs and economic stimulation, which are both needed now more than at any other time because this government has [Bookmark: Phr6_O=122.5_D=29.8_C=0.82]  put Tasmania in an uncertain and debilitating financial position. One of the ways to help bring Tasmania out of that is by stimulating economic growth.

While we have ABEL Energy still committed to northern Tasmania and Tasmania as a whole, more roadblocks are being put in the way by the Australian opposition and Mr Dutton. It is unreal that this government will not stand up and advocate. This morning, our leader called on the Premier to work with him to duly call on Mr Dutton [Bookmark: Phr7_O=152.6_D=26.5_C=0.85]  to wind back his cut of the hydrogen tax credits. It is something that we could do together as Tasmanians to ensure this investment, but the Premier remains silent on that offer. The Premier remains silent on commitments to the North West Transmission Developments and a comment addressing how he would seek to fund them if the Rewiring the Nation project is cut, which is another of Mr Dutton's reckless cuts.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=179.9_D=3.0_C=0.71] The Rewiring the Nation Fund [Bookmark: Phr9_O=183.6_D=29.8_C=0.88]  offers deeply concessional funding for those projects, which reduces the overall cost of the project and therefore reduces the burden of energy prices for Tasmanians and businesses. If that fund is cut and not available to the project, particularly the North West Transmission Developments, then the prices will go up, the cost of the project will be greater, and the Tasmanian government is yet to say how it would alternatively fund it. What we do know is that it would increase power prices [Bookmark: Phr10_O=213.5_D=26.5_C=0.80]  for Tasmanians. 

There are so many risks at present to Tasmanian individuals, householders, small businesses, medium to large businesses and our major industrials, being presented by both the Tasmanian government and the Australian opposition. It is a difficult time economically for Tasmanians. There are things that we can control, things that could support Tasmanians, but this government seems unwilling or unable to do them. Extraordinarily, in the last couple of week [Bookmark: Phr11_O=240.8_D=3.8_C=0.77] s we have had an energy minister locally who either is not across his portfolio [Bookmark: Phr12_O=244.9_D=15.6_C=0.91]  or is blatantly ignoring the facts in his portfolio, saying that he is unaware of the pressures that his energy policy is putting on Tasmanian businesses. When you couple that incompetence from our local state energy minister [Bookmark: Phr13_O=260.6_D=14.2_C=0.86]  with the challenges posed by walking back funding to critical renewable projects from the Australian opposition leader, Mr Dutton, then Tasmania is in a place that will [Bookmark: Phr14_O=276.1_D=28.2_C=0.85]  be hurting in the form of the hundreds of jobs, the billions of dollars of investment, we stand to lose opportunities for communities to find new ways of securing their futures.

Renewable energy projects in Tasmania include more than onshore wind farms like Whaleback Ridge and Robbins Island; they also include offshore wind. We have a Tasmanian government that talks about the benefits of offshore wind and the possibilities of that, but are yet to actually appropriately back in the money required to do the business case to ensure that we can secure the investments in offshore wind in Tasmania.

Bell Bay is positioned to be one of the greatest ports in a network of ports to support offshore wind in Australia, not only for the Bass Strait zone, but for all of the zones in that greater Bass Strait area. In order to do that there is timing that needs to be met, and the business case needs to be completed in the next six to 12 months.

This government, yes, have committed in the budget an amount of money that would see that work delivered, but over three years. That is another example of this government not being able to do the work in a timely and urgent way to deliver the outcomes that would actually deliver the economic returns that this government sorely need to repair the broken budget and the broken financial position of the Tasmanian state.

We call on the Tasmanian government today, we call on Mr Dutton today, to walk back your cuts, to walk back your comments around cutting Rewiring the Nation, to walk back your cuts to the hydrogen tax credits and to continue to commit to the critical future of Tasmania around renewable energy. We call on the Greens today to, as the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI) recently said, get real on renewables. You cannot expect a change to the environment without actually being real about the things that can bring that.

If you do not back in renewable energy projects in Tasmania, what are the alternatives? If not wind, then what? We have great solar projects and other projects in Tasmania, but the reality is right now - and it is critical that this government continue to be honest with the Tasmanian community - there is not enough power generated in Tasmania to cover off the existing operations of businesses in Tasmania, current businesses that want to expand and employ more people in Tasmania, current businesses that are looking to invest in Tasmania, or want to relocate here. People come here and cannot get the support that they need, not only in energy but also in water. 

It was only recently that ABEL Energy needed water to go to Bell Bay, and the Tasmanian farmers in the Tamar irrigation district wanted water. The parliament did the work, but this government has still not been able to deliver.

Marinus is critical for Tasmania's future because it unlocks the investment in billions of dollars of projects earmarked for Tasmania. North West Transmission Developments done properly is critical for Tasmania's future. The tranche required from Burnie to Hampshire where the major projects would plug into is critical for the future of Tasmania. Projects like HIF, like ABEL, are critical for the future jobs, investment and economic activity that this community needs.

Tasmanian Labor understands the proud history and legacy of hydro electrification that over 100 years has been instrumental in the support of the Tasmanian economy. We know that for the next 100 years that can be brought forward if this government would do the work to approve the projects that are needed, and do the work to stand up to their colleagues in the federal opposition. They have to stand up against Mr Dutton's agenda for nuclear, stand up against his cuts to Rewiring the Nation, stand up against his cuts to the hydrogen production tax credits and do what is right for Tasmania, Tasmanians, our families, our communities and our businesses.

[3.00 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Deputy Premier) - Honourable Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak to this motion put forward by Labor, noting, pure and simple, that it is a political stunt in the lead up to the federal election.

The motion is trying to criticise and demean the federal opposition leader and in the process it attempts - poorly - to rewrite history when it comes to Tasmania's renewable energy credentials. The Rockliff Liberal government has a strong history of supporting our renewable energy developments. We have supported them since 2014 when we first came to government. We have had a very strong agenda. I am pleased and proud to stand here not only as Deputy Premier, Treasurer, Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, but as a former minister for Energy and Renewables. 

Today, I will share some facts, for state Labor and others, regarding that history, and refuting the allegations made by the member for Bass, who was previously a strong public critic of the proposed Macquarie Point stadium and now supports it. Bumper stickers galore in her office. I do not know if there are any still there, just in case there is another change of views.
Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - There is only one person speaking at the moment, thank you.

Mr BARNETT - We know there is division across the Chamber. We know there is a divide in state Labor. We have seen Ms Haddad's views expressed in recent days. Where they will end up landing, time will tell.

Regarding our renewable energy future and our plans to back business, back industry, grow our economy and ensure there are more jobs going forward - we have created more than 45,000 jobs in the last 11 years since being in government. Our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future ensures that Tasmania has a Tasmania-first energy policy that delivers for Tasmanians. We are pleased and proud of that.

This political stunt motion today from state Labor is on the back of federal Labor, which has played politics in the most crude and disadvantageous way, putting the interests of Tasmania at the bottom. They are trying to gain Greens' votes in Melbourne and Sydney, and the federal Minister for the Environment is toying for and on behalf of federal Labor with the interests of Tasmania. 

Our productive industries have had a gutful. They have had a gutful, and I am talking about the salmon industry that has had Damocles' sword hanging over its head. Who knows what would ever happen if there were, perchance, a Labor-Greens government at the federal level? We know, based on past experience, it would not be a happy one for our productive industries.

We know what has happened in terms of forestry and the importance of a sustainable forest industry, which has been backed in by all of our industries. There is a split in federal Labor with their campaign in Tasmania, with a call for support of the end of the native forest industry in Tasmania. We have stood firm with the industry since 2014, backing it in, and in fact, well before that in opposition.

I note the document I have here from team Tasmania - the '2025 Federal Election Economic Priorities.' One of those relates to forestry and ensuring a sustainable forest industry is backed by the major parties. That went to custard last week, with the federal Labor candidate in Bass tearing that vision apart. It includes references to the importance of Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) reforms, because the federal environment minister has been playing politics with our productive industries - and I do not just mean salmon, I mean the mining industry at MMG; I mean Robbins Island wind farm.

There is concern across our business and industry groups and that is why they have delivered the team Tasmania document I am holding today, the '2025 Federal Election Economic Priorities', which we back as a government. The Premier has already publicly backed it. One of those key initiatives is backing in Marinus Link. It was the Coalition government and our Liberal government that came up with the plan in the first place - vision going back, and I give credit to Warwick Smith, former federal member for Bass, and others, years ago - more than decades ago - but we actually started it. Peter Dutton has come out strongly in support of Marinus Link, saying:

We were the architects of Marinus Link. We remain committed to it and will make sure it is completed. 

Mr Dutton goes on to say: 

The fact is, we see it - 

That is, Marinus:

- as a very important part of the future for Tasmania and for the country as well.

Labor is politicking and playing games. Mr Dutton, on behalf of the federal Coalition, has made it very clear that Marinus is not at risk under a Coalition government and that it will be funded. Reports that the project will be killed under a Coalition government are complete and utter nonsense. 

This is a game that state Labor is playing. They have no credibility when it comes to ongoing support for our productive industries. When they were in government, we saw a recession, with 10,000 jobs lost. Two out of three jobs in the forest industry were cut - sent to the mainland or onto the unemployment scrap heap. This is the history of a Labor-Greens government at the state level. There are many concerns about what might happen if there is a Labor-Greens government at the federal level.

Labor has no credibility in attacking and criticising Mr Dutton. This is coming from state Labor which for years did not have a position or actually opposed Marinus Link. I was the minister for Energy and Renewables for years and you could not get support from state Labor, year in, year out, month in, month out. Come on, give us a break. Despite previously complaining that progressing Marinus Link was 'throwing good money after bad', when it came to the crunch, state Labor has finally thrown its support behind the project. 

They flip-flop. We did not know for years what their position was, then now, in recent times, they have said, 'Yes, we support Marinus Link'. That is welcome. It is great that we have the major parties in this state supporting such a critical long-term infrastructure project that will unlock renewable energy development, jobs and growth for our economy, deliver a more energy-secure future, keep downward pressure on electricity prices and support the opening of more energy options for Tasmania, wind and solar and, of course, Hydro.

It was only a few weeks ago that I had the pleasure of touring the Tarraleah Power Station redevelopment efforts, which are well and truly underway. I thank Hydro chair Richard Bolt and acting CEO Erin van Maanen, and look forward to meeting the new CEO in the not-too-distant future. It was an excellent visit. This is part of the Tasmanian government's plan supporting Hydro and it is exciting to see that. At least part of the funding, $65 million, supporting those early works at Tarraleah comes from the former Coalition government in an agreement I negotiated with former Energy minister Angus Taylor. This is years ago. I locked in $65 million to get on with the job at Tarraleah. We appreciate the federal Coalition and the commitment it has given Tasmania for our renewable energy future. Those funds continue to be expended going forward. 

On the west coast, we have more upgrades for Hydro Tasmania in terms of renewable energy, and not just for this year and next year, but for the next decade and beyond. We have very positive plans and that is encouraging. Of course, we are the architects and, when I was Energy minister, I was pleased and proud to bring in the Renewable Energy Target, the 200 per cent by 2040. That received support across the parliament, which was very encouraging. There is also the Renewable Energy Action Plan. That was released years ago and supported. We are acting in accordance with the plan and we are very pleased and proud of that. Therefore, this criticism today is an unfortunate political stunt.  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.1_D=6.0_C=0.65] 

The member for Bass, in her remarks, made reference to electricity prices. Goodness, how about that? Electricity prices coming from a state Labor MP, trying to take some sort of credit. In the last 11 years, electricity prices for residential customers and small businesses, and the regulated electricity prices, have gone down in real terms. Under the Labor-Greens government, they went up 65 per cent, so state Labor does not have much credibility.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.6_D=30.0_C=0.84] Minister for Energy and Renewables Nick Duigan is doing a terrific job leading the charge in terms of delivering more confidence and a stronger economy as a result of our energy policy. Marinus Link will unlock over $1.3 billion in economic activity and 1400 jobs in Tasmania. However, it will do so much more than that, with another 930-plus jobs across the peaks of construction for the North West Transmissions Development [Bookmark: Phr5_O=91.9_D=28.9_C=0.77] s and other Hydro developments such as Tarraleah. I have not even mentioned Lake Cethana pumped hydro. That is well and truly planned on the books, subject to a range of assessments and a final investment decision in due course. The business case is being prepared and positively progressed positively. We are very pleased and proud about that. We will not have a bar of state Labor's criticism and attacks in this regard.  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=121.1_D=29.7_C=0.84] We are getting on with the job.

We would like state Labor to support our plans for a sustainable forest industry at the federal election; to lean on your  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=151.2_D=24.8_C=0.80] federal colleagues to ensure that applies and is locked in. We would like support for the 80:20 rule when it comes to our infrastructure projects to ensure that the federal government pays its fair share, which is the 80 per cent, and not the 50 per cent that federal Labor has been trying to force upon Tasmanians. They will be diddling Tasmanians  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=176.8_D=7.3_C=0.72] out of funds for important roadworks and road infrastructure. We want the 80:20 rule locked in and want federal Labor to lock that in, and ensure that occurs.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=184.6_D=7.6_C=0.80]  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=194.0_D=6.3_C=0.75] Kerry Vincent, who is doing a brilliant job as Minister for Infrastructure, said the infrastructure building,  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=202.4_D=12.2_C=0.76] the 80:20 rule, will connect communities. In a media release on Tuesday 7 April, he said the Tasmanian government welcomed the federal Liberals' commitment to reinstate the guaranteed 80:20 funding ratio for significant road and bridge projects in Tasmania.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=215.1_D=24.2_C=0.83] We ask state Labor to use every ounce of effort to influence federal Labor to lock that in going forward because that is in Tasmania's best interests.

I have mentioned our productive industries: salmon, mining, forestry, agriculture and fishing. I will conclude with a couple of remarks regarding Hydro. It was  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=240.3_D=6.4_C=0.88]  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=247.4_D=28.4_C=0.69] state Labor that came up with a plan to gut the Hydro with the Tasmanian Power Co policy released during the election campaign. Some of us remember this policy commitment. It was publicised so quickly that some people may not remember because it disappeared in 48 hours or so because the union thought it was a dog of a policy [Bookmark: Phr15_O=276.4_D=6.6_C=0.61] . They backed down very quickly so their credibility is not is not so good. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=283.6_D=21.4_C=0.85]  We will continue our efforts to grow our renewable energy future and we look forward to doing that with great gusto because it is all part of our plan to grow our economy and create more jobs. It is backing our Liberal plans and policies. 
Before I sit down, I again urge the shadow treasurer to put forward a costed policy. Just one would be good. The alternative budget opportunities are coming up. They have today called on this parliament and supported more taxes, more charges on Tasmanians [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.9_D=25.1_C=0.84] . Frankly, we will not have a bar of it. We are against it and they know that. Tasmanians know that we have their back, both the citizens and families as well as businesses; small, medium and large alike. There are more than 40,000 small businesses out there. We will not have a bar of more taxes and charges for those businesses. It is time state Labor conceded that, agreed, and stopp [Bookmark: Phr3_O=55.9_D=3.4_C=0.62] ed trying to peddle this idea that you are not [Bookmark: Phr4_O=59.8_D=1.7_C=0.79]  doing so. You have just done it.

[3.18 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker,   [Bookmark: Phr5_O=63.4_D=1.7_C=0.23] I rise to talk to this motion. Before I forget, I must put on the record our condemnation at this point of Peter Dutton's nuclear strategy. Nuclear is not a solution in a country like Australia where we have ample renewable resources. It is not even a strategy that the Liberal Party at the federal level believes in [Bookmark: Phr7_O=97.6_D=26.5_C=0.79] . It is not a strategy to deliver nuclear. It is too expensive, it takes too long and it is simply not viable. We have to call it for what it is. It is a complete and utter dead cat. It is all about a lifeline for the fossil fuel industry. This is all about promulgating gas and promulgating an ongoing exploitation of fossil fuel resources to generate electricity and to delay and [Bookmark: Phr8_O=124.9_D=12.1_C=0.82]  destroy the inevitable and much-needed transition to renewables.

We put on the record our condemnation of that policy. Nuclear is not a solution. It comes with so many risks, not only [Bookmark: Phr9_O=137.4_D=2.4_C=0.91]  a risk of catastrophic [Bookmark: Phr10_O=141.7_D=28.0_C=0.84]  nuclear fallout and collapse but an accident as has happened around the world at different times. Nuclear waste and where we deal with the waste from these kind of facilities is an issue. It is to be condemned that the federal government inevitably looks to remote Aboriginal lands as a dumping point for nuclear waste - not only Australia's nuclear waste, but in some cases [Bookmark: Phr11_O=170.2_D=27.2_C=0.88]  international nuclear waste. I want to make sure that it is abundantly clear that the Greens will stand opposed to nuclear energy come what may, and nuclear weapons come what may. In many ways the two go hand in hand. 

I want to say that in looking at this motion, we support the need for action on climate change and the fact that it is a significant national [Bookmark: Phr12_O=198.2_D=4.3_C=0.80]  and global issue. Tasmania is not immune. We [Bookmark: Phr13_O=203.2_D=29.8_C=0.81]  have seen a summer where fires have ravaged our west coast wilderness areas and coastal areas, where we are unable to deal with the increase in dry lightning strikes which is happening because of climate change, the increase in the fires that occur as a result, the drier landscape and the fact that these fires spent weeks just meandering around the landscape and ultimately consuming 100,000 hectares of country [Bookmark: Phr14_O=233.1_D=8.2_C=0.81]  over on the west coast. 

The sheer scale of the destruction over there is immense. Not all of that landscape would have been [Bookmark: Phr15_O=243.2_D=24.9_C=0.74]  fire adverse. Some of it is quite tolerant to fire and has burned before and will burn again. It is a simple fact that it burns more intensely these days because the landscape is dryer. The scale of it, the sheer extent of the fires this time is of significant concern. Irrespective of [Bookmark: Phr16_O=269.0_D=29.8_C=0.84]  the vegetation, the scale of it and the extent of it is truly alarming.

We have had shocks in this state before: environmental, social and economic shocks from these kind of natural disasters, from the fires and floods that keep happening. These are things that our economy and our people and our emergency services have to deal with. Sea level rise is consuming parts of our coastline. The warming waters are contributing to a whole range of issues in our coastal [Bookmark: Phr17_O=299.1_D=5.9_C=0.81]  environments, probably not least some of the issues that are being faced by the salmon industry this year.

In Tasmania, when we look at climate change, we have to consider the global humanity, our brothers and sisters in the Pacific region. It is the poorest people of the world who have made the least contribution to climate change who suffer the greatest impact.

The Greens stand for action on climate change. We know that we need to take action, and we need to take it urgently. That is not just in a transition in the energy space. We absolutely do need to transition urgently away from fossil fuels to renewable energy, but it cannot stop there.
We have to take action to end native forest logging. Native forest logging is a massive carbon contributor from this state. It is one of our biggest contributors. As we enter the autumn burn season, we will all have an opportunity to see our contribution to climate change, writ large across our skies over the coming months. It is a disgusting disgrace that in this state we are still logging native forests and destroying the habitat of threatened and endangered species. We are burning them after we have logged them and putting massive carbon bombs into the atmosphere. It is a disgrace and it must end.

We need to be restoring degraded landscapes. They are a huge opportunity from a climate perspective, because as they recover, they will suck carbon out of the atmosphere and they will contribute to addressing climate change and storing that carbon in ecosystems. It is the same in the marine environment. We have seen the loss of our giant kelp forests and other important marine ecosystems. We need to be doing more both to protect those systems from predators such as the Centrostephanus, and to restore these ecosystems.

We need to get out of our cars, at the end of the day. I know my colleague over there, Helen Burnet, member for Clark, is a great advocate for active transport and public transport. We need to get people out of their cars. The transport sector is a huge emitter in Tasmania. We need to get people out of their cars and into buses. This government stands condemned in relation to the public transport network, particularly in Hobart where services have been cut. We heard the question being asked this morning about an 11-year-old girl who had to stand for an hour or more, waiting for a bus to get to school, could not get it, and had to turn around and go home. We are not going to get people out of their cars and into buses if we have not got a reliable public transport system.

We need active transport systems as well. How shameful is it that here in this clean, green, clever state, we have the Minister for Transport pulling funding from an active transport initiative trial in this city, the Collins Street bike lanes. This is despite the fact that it is clear the community supports that trial and the fact that it is critical for the safety of our people. We need to get people out of their cars and into active modes of transport, and we need more things like bike lanes.

We also need renewable energy, but we need the right renewable energy in the right place and it needs to be assessed in the right way. The Office of the Tasmanian Economic Regulator (OTTER) in March 2025 published its Energy in Tasmania Report 2023-24. It has some really interesting data in it. I will quote a little bit:

Compared to 2022-23, the Tasmanian energy market experienced:

a 1.3 per cent decrease in energy consumption;

a 5.0 per cent decrease in on-island energy generation;
a 9.3 per cent decrease in hydro-electric generation;

a 31.0 per cent increase in the amount of solar energy that was exported to the Tasmanian electricity grid;

a significant increase in gas-fired electricity generation, up from 71 GWh in 2022-23 to 221 GWh in 2023-24;

net imports of 1 249 GWh across Basslink;

…

a 2.3 per cent reduction in the total number of residential gas customers.

What that tells us is that Tasmania, as it stands today in the year 2023-24, is certainly not 100 per cent renewable. It is certainly not necessarily leading the world. One of the reasons that Hydro's generation was down was because there was less rainfall and Hydro's catchments were down. To read in here:

During 2023-2024, there was very low rainfall over Hydro Tasmania's catchments. To preserve energy and storage levels, Hydro Tasmania reduced its hydroelectric generation, increased its gas generation and imported more energy through the Basslink interconnector.

There are some challenges in our energy system and it is clear that we are not 100 per cent renewable. We do need renewable energy and we need to have that assessed and located properly.

Solar is a huge opportunity. Let me read into here what the OTTER report says about solar:

The contribution of small-scale solar generation to Tasmania's generation mix continued to increase, with a 49-gigawatt hour or 31 per cent increase in exports to the network compared to 2022-2023. This growth is attributable to 4613 new solar installations in 2023-2024 and to 2023-2024 being a particularly sunny year. Although data is not available, it is likely that  commensurate increase in unmeasured on-site consumption of generation from small-scale solar has contributed to the 1.3 per cent decrease in measured consumption in 2023-2024.

Solar offers a huge opportunity for Tasmania. We have been on the record repeatedly here in this place about initiatives, and taken to the election initiatives, to make sure that solar panels are rolled out across public and social and affordable housing, so that those tenants and occupants of those houses can derive a benefit from what is on their roof and can save money on their power bills as a result.

People can save and we can use less energy if we are installing and creating more energy efficient properties that way. They are going to be using less energy to heat their properties or indeed to cool their properties and that will cost them less. With battery technology getting cheaper, more efficient and more accessible, the opportunities in this space are huge.

There is also large-scale solar. I have been several times to Connorville to have a look with Roderick O'Connor at his proposal for very large-scale solar, larger than the wind farms that we have in this state. He has done it in a really sensitive and appropriate way. He has done it on already cleared agricultural land. He has done it right next to an existing transmission line, so it does not need to be pushing transmission infrastructure through as-yet uncompromised landscapes. It is this smart, industrial-scale energy generation that we are really strongly support.

Similarly with efficiencies in Hydro - I too have been to Tarraleah a couple of times and the notion of upgrading to improve the efficiency and the use of water in some of our Hydro facilities is clearly a good one. We need to be making the most of the water that has been dammed because those rivers and environments have been lost, and we need to do better with them.

When it comes to wind, from our perspective, we are supporters of wind, but not at any cost. We have been supporters of projects over the past, but take Robbins Island for example. Robbins Island is explicitly named up in this motion as something for which they are seeking our support, together with Whale Back Ridge, which is proposed for a nature conservation reserve in the north-west.

The environmental impacts of Robbins Island are really clear and, from our perspective, have not been properly dealt with. 

Mr Ellis - I thought you were talking about already cleared land just before.

Mr BAYLEY - These migratory shore birds are not really interested in the cleared land, minister Ellis. There are migratory parrots. We saw a situation where the EPA itself wanted to impose a shutdown during the migration season of the parrot. Of course, there are disease-free Tasmanian devils on Robbins Island. It is not at any cost. There are clearly costs associated with Robbins Island Wind Farm.

The State Coastal Policy - we had a cost to our democratic processes here where a reform to the State Coastal Policy and a retrospective of approval was rammed through this place within a matter of days to overcome a legal hurdle without actually letting a live court case conclude, without letting the community who was in the Supreme Court have their case heard and have the court do what courts do when there is ambiguity around law, which is make a determination. Instead, the developer clearly rang up and the government jumped, with Labor's support, and put that legislation through this parliament.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=24.8_C=0.74] When it comes to Robbins Island and the Aboriginal community, there are not many things Aboriginal people across the board and Aboriginal organisations are united on, but when it comes to Robbins Island it seems the case. I know the Aboriginal Land Council and the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre have been implacably opposed and engaged in the process around Robbins Island, and utterly underwhelmed by the response. Also [Bookmark: Phr3_O=55.6_D=7.9_C=0.72] , unbelievably, the Circular Head Aboriginal Corporation has put its opposition to  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=64.2_D=29.7_C=0.80] the Robbins Island development very clearly on the record. They say that their response is one simple ask: that Aboriginal communities across Tasmania are included in energy matters that relate to them, namely the developments associated with energy power. 

Robbins Island is a living Aboriginal cultural landscape. It was somewhere that Robinson visited when he was rounding up the last of the tribal Aboriginal people when they were en route to [Bookmark: Phr5_O=94.3_D=27.8_C=0.66]  Wybalenna at Flinders Island. It is a really special place. It is a really special Aboriginal cultural landscape, but it is a really special shared landscape for that reason as well. To think that Robbins Island has been assessed and did not even trigger a permit, as I understand it, under the Aboriginal Heritage Act. 

I remind the House again, three-and-a-half years ago the minister came into this House and tabled a report  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=122.9_D=4.1_C=0.57] on the review of the Aboriginal Heritage Act that said that it did not work [Bookmark: Phr7_O=127.3_D=24.6_C=0.83]  and it did not provide effective mechanisms of protection for Aboriginal heritage. Despite this, projects as odious from an Aboriginal heritage perspective as Robbins Island are assessed against that development, irrespective. 

Then there are the transmission line impacts. We know the North West Transmission Developments project has been hotly contested by communities in the north-west who are concerned about those transmission projects pushing through either reserve land, forested land or land that is really important from a community perspective. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=172.8_D=0.8_C=0.85]  This is the problem with large, industrial-scale generation in remote areas versus what we would support when it comes to renewables, which is distributed networks. 

We would like to see more smaller scale distributed community networks and batteries put on roofs around our communities. It is more resilient from a bushfire and a natural disaster perspective. It is less expensive, and as you can see from the OTTER report, with a 39 per cent increase in solar generation and uptake, it is a really popular thing as well. People want to do it because people make real savings.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=204.2_D=29.6_C=0.70] When it comes to Marinus, I am sitting on a joint select committee and it is hearing some really interesting evidence. It is clear that its mind is not made up around the benefits or the value of Marinus. We heard Mr Garland come into this place yesterday and  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=234.3_D=15.2_C=0.80] raise the issue of one industrial customer having been told that because of Marinus, its transmission costs are going to go up by 29.6 per cent - that is Grange Resources.  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=249.8_D=28.6_C=0.80] 

It is a massive project. It has cost Tasmania $100 million plus already. It is a $3.86 billion project for just stage 1. That includes the North West Transmission Developments. It is a $2.8 billion investment in stage  2, and we are yet to even see the whole-of-state business case. 

It is absolutely impossible really to make an informed judgment that Marinus is going to be good for the state or deliver [Bookmark: Phr15_O=279.2_D=2.2_C=0.52]  lower prices or drive [Bookmark: Phr16_O=282.4_D=16.6_C=0.84]  a certain amount of activity, because that work is still being done. It is going to be handed down some time in May, and then we understand the government will make an investment decision some time later in the year. 

Marinus from our perspective is  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=301.6_D=3.1_C=0.76] not necessarily a beneficial project. We are not hotly opposed, but we are not supportive. We are deeply concerned about the industrialisation that it will drive across our landscapes, the sheer scale of industrial development, particularly when it comes to wind farms across our landscape. I will put those concerns on the record here and now and look forward to continuing to participate [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.8_D=7.4_C=0.64]  in the Select Committee for Energy.
At the end of the day, is it Tasmania's job [Bookmark: Phr3_O=38.0_D=16.7_C=0.89]  to drive the renewable energy transition on the mainland? On the mainland level there are similar opportunities in terms of solar generation, distributed networks in communities, energy efficiency, a whole range of different factors [Bookmark: Phr4_O=55.0_D=26.1_C=0.76] . With the environmental and social issues that are associated with an industrial scale rollout of energy across our landscape, there are deep concerns about that.

I am going to leave it there and I will leave time for other speakers. I know Mr Garland would like to get to his feet. While we can agree that climate change is a significant national and global issue [Bookmark: Phr5_O=82.2_D=7.1_C=0.81]  and we need to develop new renewable energy power, there are other aspects of this motion that are hugely problematic. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=89.9_D=29.7_C=0.82]  We did toy with the idea of amending but decided against it because there is a fair bit of amending to do.

From the Greens' perspective, we will not be supporting this motion. We strongly support renewable energy. We strongly support our transition away from fossil fuels. We strongly oppose nuclear energy, but the details and the content of this motion render it unsupportable from our perspective.

[3.38 p.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) -  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=120.6_D=2.4_C=0.47]  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=126.3_D=1.2_C=0.18]  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=128.5_D=3.7_C=0.72] Honourable Speaker, I too rise to speak on this Labor motion number 120. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=133.0_D=10.8_C=0.80]  I am surprised to see that the member, Ms Finlay, has brought forward this motion for debate at this time. It clearly traverses into an area that is being considered by a joint standing committee that she sits on. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=144.7_D=25.4_C=0.79]  I also sit on that committee, as do two other members in this House. The committee has sat for seven days, receiving oral evidence and has received more than 60 submissions. As anyone who has sat on a committee knows, sometimes committees receive confidential information to which it is unable to refer. For committee members to publicly debate matters which are currently under consideration by the committee is highly problematic.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=171.1_D=15.6_C=0.83] The motion in this debate also comes before the whole-of-state business case is released, so I think this motion is ill-considered. I respect the work of the committee and the rules of the committee. I have traversed those rules once and have formally apologised in this parliament, and I do not want to do that again. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=187.4_D=23.6_C=0.79]  I recognise the importance of people having faith in the integrity of the committee process, including that committee members will not prejudge the committee's findings and recommendations. If I speak on this motion today, I jeopardise my position on that committee. For that reason I will not be speaking today on the motion, nor will I be voting on it. Quite frankly, I am surprised Ms Finlay has brought this on in her name.

[3.40 p.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I am pleased to rise this afternoon and speak on this notice of motion brought forward by my colleague Ms Finlay. I note the previous speaker's comments in relation to memberships of committees et cetera. I would say in that instance that this has been brought forward from some serious concerns that our side of the House has about this government's commitment to renewable energy projects across the state, but more importantly [Bookmark: Phr16_O=247.0_D=24.9_C=0.73] , the missed opportunities that we are seeing in Tasmania at the moment from this lacklustre government.

The former Energy minister spoke. We need to put that in context - the former Energy minister got up in his role as Treasurer and lectured us about things that happened probably 10 years ago. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=272.7_D=5.1_C=0.72]  I want to point out to him that he is no longer the Energy minister and there is probably a reason for that. He was [Bookmark: Phr18_O=278.4_D=26.0_C=0.86]  not effective in that role at all. You can see the consequences of that with the delays, predominantly to some of these wind farm developments across our state which will bring economic activity and will bring jobs, particularly to regional Tasmania. At a time in Tasmania since this government entered minority government, we have lost 9000 jobs. This government should be doing everything that they can to create employment opportunities for people [Bookmark: Phr19_O=304.7_D=0.1_C=0.24]  outside of the major centres and also in regional Tasmania.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=8.3_D=29.0_C=0.80] As for the Greens, they do not have any belief in the importance of industry at all. To hear the Deputy Leader of the Greens talk down industrialisation - this state was built on industrialisation. Industrialisation has changed Tasmania's landscape forever. It brought economic opportunity to people right across Tasmania, no matter what region you were in. That was fundamentally underpinned by renewable energy and the Hydro [Bookmark: Phr3_O=37.7_D=30.0_C=0.75] . The biggest economic driver in the state's history was the Hydro, which, I might add was the legacy of a Labor government and the great Eric Reece.

The former Energy minister does not really has any position or authority to come in here and lecture us around this issue. I point to his role as Treasurer. He should be working [Bookmark: Phr4_O=67.8_D=29.8_C=0.79]  constructively with ABEL Energy on their project to ensure that the jobs that could be secured through that project and their economic opportunities across the state could be realised. Instead you have a government that is not doing that. We have heard that firsthand from meetings on-site with ABEL Energy, understanding some of the difficulties they have had in progressing their development over the years and in working with this government.

You see that right across renewable energy projects,  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=97.9_D=24.0_C=0.65] whether it be Whaleback Ridge - how many years do we have to talk about the economic benefits of Whaleback Ridge and what that could do, particularly for the people of my electorate in Braddon? It has been held up by this government every step of the way. They have done nothing to ensure that that development progresses. They have now put it into a major projects process, I believe [Bookmark: Phr6_O=123.0_D=6.6_C=0.79] , after a significant period of time where nothing progressed under your government.

Mr Jaensch - That is what they asked for. Do you not support that?

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr Jaensch.

Mr Jaensch - I am just trying to work out if the member is opposed to the major projects entry.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - You have only been sitting down for 30 seconds, Mr Jaensch, and you are already interjecting.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=130.4_D=29.9_C=0.70] Ms DOW - We supported the major projects legislation through this place, and to be quite honest, they have not really used it at all. There was a huge amount of puff and spin and rhetoric around the importance of major projects legislation and yet we have hardly seen any projects enabled through that legislation. It was meant to be a turning point for planning in this state.

I can understand that Mr Jaensch is a bit sensitive, since he was the Planning minister [Bookmark: Phr8_O=160.5_D=27.1_C=0.76]  around those times. A lot of these things and a lot of the lapses in planning reform happened during his time and not much was progressed. We have a lack of strategic planning and a much more heavily regulated planning system across the state. It has become more complicated, more expensive and more complex under this government - quite the contrary to what they set out in their objectives in 2014 to achieve [Bookmark: Phr9_O=188.4_D=2.0_C=0.90] , but I digress.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=191.0_D=2.7_C=0.91] This is an important motion before the House today [Bookmark: Phr11_O=195.6_D=28.0_C=0.80] . I want to commend my colleague Ms Finlay for bringing it forward. Where I come from in the north-west of Tasmania, there is a lot of investment that is just sitting there, a lot of opportunity that needs to be enabled. I go to the Business NorthWest breakfast where we have had presentations from Marinus Link and others. I have heard about the local businesses who want to be involved in this project [Bookmark: Phr12_O=224.1_D=23.9_C=0.77] . This is a project, again, that this government has been talking about for years now, and they are still talking about it with little action.

Some of the concerns that Ms Finlay raises in this are pretty pertinent to my electorate. Some of those projects include the HIF project, the North West Transmission Line project [Bookmark: Phr13_O=249.0_D=3.4_C=0.83] , and the Robbins Island Wind Farm, which has been delayed under this government. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=253.2_D=10.7_C=0.78]  These are all critical projects that will ensure Tasmania's renewable energy future. They are all really important projects, but they have stalled under this government.

Today in Question Time there was uncertainty, I believe, from the Energy minister in his answers about funding and financing and questions that we asked about that, particular schemes and what that would mean for Tasmanian businesses, for Marinus and for Abel Energy. He was not able to clearly articulate where that opportunity for finance or funding would come from under an alternative [Bookmark: Phr16_O=293.1_D=9.8_C=0.69]  Dutton Liberal Coalition government at a federal level.

I want to take this opportunity to commend my colleague, former senator Anne Urquhart,  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=303.7_D=1.2_C=0.62] who is our federal Labor candidate for Braddon, who has done a power of work behind the scenes and publicly promoting the importance of renewable energy projects like Robbins Island. She wants to see those projects progress and is dead set against Peter Dutton's nuclear energy plan. I do not think the Liberal candidate, Mal Hingston, has had quite as much conviction when it comes to his opposition to nuclear power. 

The Premier said this morning that he admired Peter Dutton's nuclear energy plan, which is absurd. I was quite surprised to hear the Premier say that. He had an opportunity to rule it in or rule it out, and he said he admired it. That was interesting. I am sure there will be more to be said about that as the federal election campaign rolls on.

On this side of the House, we want to see progress in Tasmania. We value industry. We understand the role industrialisation has played across our state to create wealth and employment, and to underpin Tasmania's economy. I do not believe those on the other side understand that. They have lost their way. Whether it is power increases to our major industrials or flawed planning processes, it is a government that just cannot get anything done, a government that has reached the end of its tether.

We understand the importance of these things. I do not think they do. You only have to listen to the contribution of the Treasurer earlier. He talks about politics, but he is all about politics. It is the way he undertakes his work in this place, across his ministerial responsibilities and even his deputy leadership responsibilities.

We need substance. We need a government that can get things done. I am pleased that my colleague, Janie Finlay, has bought this motion to the House today. It is appropriate that she do that regardless of her role on a committee, and we seek the support of the House.
[3.49 p.m.]
Mr WOOD (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, before I kick off, Mr Bayley referenced the parliamentary committee on Energy that you are a member of. I think you are on that committee too, Ms Finlay. You are looking into a lot of these things through that?

Ms FINLAY - Mm.

Mr WOOD - Tasmania is Australia's leading renewable energy state. We reached our goal to be self-sufficient in renewables two years ahead of our 2022 target. We were the first state in Australia,, and one of the first jurisdictions in the world with 100 per cent net renewable energy generation. We are a leader in clean energy generation.

Our government understands that continuing to develop our renewable energy industry is critical to securing a strong economic future for Tasmania. Our ambitious renewable energy agenda will keep downward pressure on energy prices, increase the supply of reliable and affordable power, and bolster Tasmania's economy through new jobs and investment.

We have a proud history of hydro power generation. For over 100 years, our state's lakes, rivers and dams have produced the base-load power needed to power our homes, businesses and industry. Clean, green, modern hydro power will remain the backbone of our energy system going forward, setting the foundation for ongoing economic growth for this state. We are modernising, upgrading and expanding our hydro power capacity through a substantial pipeline of upgrades for the west coast system, along with progressing the Tarraleah redevelopment and Cethana pumped hydro project. Up to 600 jobs are expected to be created across the construction peaks of these projects. These are jobs for Tasmanian workers, boosting our workforce's skills and delivering real economic benefits to our regions.

However, we will need more than just hydro power. Our government is also delivering on wind and solar projects. We have four large-scale projects progressing through our Major Projects pathway, a pathway that all major renewable projects are now automatically eligible to use. 

An agreement was recently signed between TasRex and Hydro Tasmania for an off-take agreement for the Northern Midlands Solar Farm. At 288 megawatts, this will be the state's first large-scale solar farm. It is a great example of the sorts of projects that this government is helping to deliver. However, projects in Tasmania are being held up by the federal Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC). If state Labor can acknowledge that renewable energy projects are critical to our state's future, then why have they not spoken to their federal colleagues to progress the EPBC Act approvals that are holding up Tasmanian projects like Robbins Island?

We support the Robbins Island project. It will create hundreds of jobs for our regions, provide clean, affordable energy for Tasmania and support the nation to reduce global emissions. It has been through a rigorous planning assessment process and is now awaiting EPBC approvals from the Australian government, delayed now for the fifth time since federal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek took office. We know that an EPBC approval is the final step. Perhaps Ms Finlay could encourage her federal colleagues to make a decision and not continue the delaying tactics which are so damaging to this project, our energy sector in Tasmania and investor confidence generally. We have had nothing but silence from the Labor opposition on this delay from their federal colleagues, Labor showing yet again it is all talk and no action when it comes to standing up for everyday Tasmanians.

This is in constant contrast to our government, which has consistently been delivering in this critical space. We have signed a Renewable Energy Transformation Agreement (RETA) with the Australian Government and secured a second dedicated allocation for Tasmanian renewable energy projects in the Capacity Investment Scheme. We are making the approvals process easier through our $14.4 million Renewable Energy Approval Pathway. We have removed barriers to Hydro investing in new renewable energy generation. We have delivered on the $8 million Green Hydrogen Price Reduction Scheme and announced Countrywide Hydrogen as the successful applicant.

We have also commenced producing green hydrogen in Tasmania with one of the largest micro-grids in Australia becoming operational through our partnership with the Blue Economy CRC. This is a nation-leading development and signals the start of a new industry in Tasmania, one that is critical to securing a strong economic future for Tasmania. It is incredibly exciting.

Less than a week ago, federal Labor stepped back from some of its hydrogen commitments, emptying an $80 million fund it set up only three years ago to turbo-charge the take-up of hydrogen-powered trucks. When state Labor members were busy casting doubt on our hydrogen ambitions, perhaps they should have been looking at the actions of their federal colleagues.

The production of green hydrogen is an industry perfectly suited to Tasmania. We have a grid that is already 100 per cent net renewable and sites suitable for these requirements. This is the type of energy generation we are focused on; energy generation that complements Tasmania's existing capacities and helps Tasmania retain its nation-leading renewable energy credentials. 

We have also partnered with the federal government to establish a $27.2 million Clean Energy Centre of Excellence, with a dedicated focus on renewable energy skills because we know we will need a skilled, capable and future-ready workforce to deliver our energy agenda.

Marinus Link is a key part of the puzzle that unlocks our renewable energy future. It is pleasing to see state Labor finally getting behind this transformational project. It will create jobs for the future, particularly for north-west Tasmania, and unlock access to markets that support new renewable energy generation projects in Tasmania. 

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=9.6_D=23.6_C=0.83] The North West Transmission Developments is a critical connecting link for Marinus, creating a connecting network on our island with an undersea cable. All these projects together will create significant job opportunities for our state, helping to keep our young people in Tasmania and giving them bright futures. These are jobs for Tasmanian workers [Bookmark: Phr3_O=34.1_D=4.7_C=0.66] , boosting our workforce skills and delivering real economic benefits to our regions.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=40.4_D=9.1_C=0.68] Marinus Link will be Tasmania's largest infrastructure project and we are delivering on it in conjunction with the federal and Victorian governments. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=50.8_D=10.6_C=0.79]  Marinus Link in the North West Transmission Developments will underpin investment in new renewable capacities, increasing investment for future proponents. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=63.0_D=7.0_C=0.86]  Our government understands the work that needs to be done and our government has the vision for Tasmania's energy future.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=71.8_D=12.4_C=0.83] Our 2030 Strong Plan commits to a Tasmania First Energy policy to create the energy Tasmania needs for our future while delivering the lowest possible power prices for Tasmanians. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=86.0_D=14.6_C=0.89]  As others have said, an important part of delivering this project is the partnership the Tasmanian government has struck with the Australian and Victorian governments. We have a shareholder agreement in place. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=101.4_D=1.4_C=0.72]  We are locked in. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=104.1_D=8.9_C=0.91]  We have a final investment decision pending later this year when all three governments will make a decision on progressing this important project.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=114.8_D=15.2_C=0.80] We are confident in the funding arrangements. We do not believe it is appropriate to dictate to another government how they should structure their policy programs to fund their commitments. This is what calling to support Rewiring the Nation does. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=131.6_D=22.6_C=0.77]  We believe it is appropriate for governments to support the project and deliver on their commitments. We stand behind our commitments and our policy to deliver Project Marinus, should it stack up, in the best interests of Tasmania. We expect other governments who have signed up to the shareholder agreement for Marinus Link to do the same. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=155.0_D=4.0_C=0.93]  That is something we encourage all members of this parliament to support. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=161.4_D=5.6_C=0.86]  Under a Liberal government, Tasmania's energy future looks very bright.

[3.59 p.m.]
Mr JAENSCH (Braddon - Minister for Finance) - [Bookmark: Phr15_O=174.3_D=24.6_C=0.81]  Deputy Speaker, I thank the member for bringing this motion today and to have the opportunity to speak on it. Working through the motion and its various clauses, this side of the House, for me and our party in government, we agree that climate change is a significant national and global issue and that Tasmania needs to develop renewable energy [Bookmark: Phr16_O=199.5_D=7.2_C=0.76]  to power Tasmanian industry, create jobs, support the electrification of the vehicle network, and contribute to national efforts to reduce emissions.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=207.2_D=29.0_C=0.77] We support the construction of new wind farms at Robbins Island, Whaleback Ridge, and other areas of Tasmania, including offshore, as well as projects to produce e-fuels, such as in my own electorate in Braddon. We recognise that Marinus Link and both stages of the North West Transmission Developments are essential infrastructure for the future, and we have been consistent on these matters. We have not flip-flopped around on them as others have, and we are confident  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=237.5_D=1.5_C=0.85] that the federal [Bookmark: Phr19_O=240.2_D=25.3_C=0.79]  coalition opposition also supports these projects and Tasmania's unique roles in Australia's future energy grid. We are confident in its acknowledgment of the contribution that we can make and its support for the projects needed to realise the full potential of Tasmania's contribution.

We do have a problem when the opposition comes in here and, on the basis of a common understanding of Tasmania's potential and the importance of these projects, seeks to insert a clause [Bookmark: Phr21_O=274.9_D=26.7_C=0.90]  with a political wedge in a federal election context. They bring that on in this House for a bit of point-scoring. It is a bit cheap; a bit weak. We have bigger issues to talk about, like how we are continuing to roll out Tasmania's renewable energy advantage and make it happen. I am not confident that we do have the federal Albanese Labor government's support for Robbins Island, for example - that is in the mix here. I am certain that we do have Peter Dutton's and the federal Coalition's support for the future of Marinus Link, and, as I said before, Tasmania's unique contribution to the national grid. They recognise that Tasmania has  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=28.0_D=3.6_C=0.72] separate and special natural resources,  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=32.1_D=14.2_C=0.78] assets, and a history of renewable-energy generation, and that our state will participate in the national grid in a different way to others.

Overall we are going to need to have the supply that Australia needs for its future which can include  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=47.6_D=25.5_C=0.74] energy sources like nuclear. They may not play out strongly here, but we play a different role in that system, particularly as a Battery of the Nation, particularly connected through the Marinus Link to the rest of the grid, playing our role. That is why we need projects like Robbins Island to get up and to be supported. This is the area where it would be nice to see and if Labor was being even-handed with its motion, then it would be calling on  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=74.3_D=8.1_C=0.64] minister Plibersek to make clear the federal government's position regarding that project, which is also included in this motion.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=83.7_D=2.2_C=0.70] We will continue to work with  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=87.0_D=28.7_C=0.83] any Australian government to ensure the success of Tasmania's renewable energy future, to maintain our position in the nation, build the essential infrastructure of Marinus, and to ensure that we have the support we need and the investment we need to make all that happen. We will work in Tasmania's best interests with anybody to ensure these projects and this potential [Bookmark: Phr8_O=116.5_D=18.2_C=0.72]  is brought to fruition. We are very confident that Peter Dutton and the Coalition, if they are elected to government, will work with us and we look forward to the opportunity to do that, as we have worked, where we could, with the Australian government up till now. 

To that end, we have found it very difficult to engage successfully with the federal government in terms of delivering projects like Robbins Island. There have been continuing delays with the parts of the process that minister Plibersek has been responsible for. We know that there has been a breakdown in what has traditionally been a more productive bilateral arrangement between the state and federal governments when it comes to environmental approvals.  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=165.0_D=0.3_C=0.21] Some of the information put forward by Tasmanian experts has not been fully regarded by the Commonwealth and that has led to delay and duplication. With a future Australian government, we would love to see a streamlining and a one-stop shop when it comes to environmental matters of those kinds. Those are the types of things that could also play out with approvals in the future for MMG at Roseberry [Bookmark: Phr12_O=193.4_D=4.7_C=0.75]  and other projects around the state that have complex environmental approvals. We need to get that right.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=198.7_D=1.8_C=0.93] In terms of today's motion [Bookmark: Phr14_O=202.2_D=2.0_C=0.95] , I propose an amendment to  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=206.3_D=6.3_C=0.92] motion 120. I move - 

Delete paragraph (4).

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=216.5_D=3.1_C=0.57] I have one for all of us. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=222.5_D=1.7_C=0.13]   [Bookmark: Phr18_O=224.5_D=4.5_C=0.78]  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=230.9_D=6.6_C=0.63] To remove the paragraph 4, 'Further supports the Albanese Labor government's Rewiring the Nation policy …' [Bookmark: Phr23_O=253.4_D=2.1_C=0.51]  [Bookmark: Phr24_O=257.6_D=2.4_C=0.53]  [Bookmark: Phr25_O=266.6_D=19.9_C=0.81] . On the amendment, as I said at the beginning in the preamble, there are a number of points in this motion that the government supports and will continue to support: some of which the government has supported longer and stronger than the Labor opposition has both in this  [Bookmark: Phr26_O=287.1_D=15.6_C=0.81] in this House, in this Parliament, and also apparently at federal level. I point to Robbins Island in that regard because we have not yet heard what the federal government and the federal minister's opinion is of that project. 

We think it is unnecessary and divisive, and unnecessarily political, to insert into that for political opportunism a party-political election policy on this one, because it cheapens your commitments to the other preceding matters. It makes it a preamble to a political pitch and we can do better than that in this House. I believe that if we had moved that paragraph forward, we would have a motion here which the House could support without politicising it.

We look forward to being able to see these projects and Tasmania's role in the national energy market reach its full potential. We are committed to the projects that are listed in this motion. We will work with any government in Canberra to advance Tasmania's best interests. We question whether federal Labor can be relied on to support all of the projects that have been listed in this motion.

We remain committed. We believe Tasmania has an extraordinarily strong future. We believe that if there was a change of government, we would still, from this side of the House, work strongly in Tasmania's best interests with any leader of any party. We do not believe that we need to put a political wedge into this motion on this day in order to state our resolve for Tasmania's natural advantages, our point of difference or the particular contribution that Tasmania can make into the national energy story. 

We believe that Labor has no mortgage on these, and there is certainly evidence that they are not fully behind projects like Robbins Island at this stage of the game, given the repeated delays that we have seen. Now we are in an election period and we still do not have certainty for that project when we could have had it a year ago. 

I am keen to see this amendment considered by the House and, with the support of the House, our support for this motion.

[4.09 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - Deputy Speaker, let me at it. When I read this motion, I thought, 'Look, I reckon the government are going to support this because this is their project after all.' Project Marinus is something they have had on the drawing board for almost 12 years. It was actually Matthew Groom's - shadow minister for energy - policy from 2013, if you can believe it. This is a policy that has been theirs for their entire existence, and I just heard one of the ministers -

Mr Jaensch - Are you speaking to the amendment?

Ms Ogilvie - Yes, are you speaking to the amendment?

Mr WINTER - That is exactly what your amendment is about; it is about deleting your own policy.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - We have made it clear in previous weeks that, with limited time for debate on these things, we allow the amendments and the substantive to be debated concurrently anyway, even though you are on the amendment, Mr Winter.

Mr WINTER - I am on the amendment, because the minister has just got up and said he wants to delete the clause that says 'further supports the Albanese Labor government's Rewiring the Nation policy and recognises its critical role in funding essential transmission projects like Marinus Link and the North West Transmission Developments'. That is their policy. That is their project that they are asking to delete from the motion.

The government of Tasmania that has been pushing this policy for almost 12 years wants us to delete it, and the only way this gets deleted today is if they team up with the Greens in order to delete it. Which genius back there thought this was a good idea this morning? Thought, 'We are going to delete our own policy from any existence and then ask the Greens to back us in.' 

You know who will? The Greens. The Deputy Leader of the Greens is sitting there and he is excited, because he does not believe in Marinus, does not want to see North West Transmission Developments, he wants to drain Lake Pedder, he does not want to see Robbins Island go ahead, he does not want to see HIF go ahead, and he does not want to see ABEL Energy - and by the way, neither does this government go ahead. This government is just standing here talking about its own policy and deleting it from existence in this motion. If this amendment is passed, their own policy is deleted. 

Time expired.

DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Street) - The time for debate has expired. The question is that the amendment be agreed to.

MOTION

Documents Relating To MinterEllison, Macquarie Point Development Corporation, and Crown Law

[4.32 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I will require a vote. I move -

That the House orders the government to table before the Adjournment of the House on 10 April 2025 -

Any correspondence between any government department, agency and/or minister and MinterEllison on or after 31 March 2025.

Any correspondence between any government department, agency and/or minister and the Macquarie Point Development Corporation relating to legal advice for the Project of State Significance process for the Macquarie Point stadium on or after 31 March 2025; 

Any correspondence between any government department, agency and/or minister and the Macquarie Point Development Corporation relating to the Tasmanian Planning Commission’s Draft Integrated Assessment Report for the Macquarie Point stadium on or after 31 March 2025; and

A copy of advice provided by Crown Law to any government department, agency and/or minister relating to the Tasmanian Planning Commission’s Draft Integrated Assessment Report for the Macquarie Point stadium.

This motion is all about transparency. As we go into a phase now of this stadium debacle where we, as members, are going to be asked to vote on the approval of this stadium, without any credible assessment to refer to that has been concluded, this motion is all about transparency.

The stadium is in the wrong place and it comes from the wrong place. Mac Point is completely the wrong place for this development. It comes from the wrong place because it was never supposed to be part of the AFL deal in the first place. The tripartisan agreement that we Greens, the Labor Party and the Liberal Party signed in support of an AFL men's and women's team in Tasmania did not include a stadium.

An August 2022 story that is still on the AFL's news website says, 'The Premier confirms that a new stadium will not be part of Tassie's AFL bid.' The rest is history. Mr Rockliff went on to sign a dud deal with the AFL with no reference to his own Cabinet, no reference or advice from Treasury and no conversation with the community. That dud deal locks us into a stadium. It locks us into a specific site, a specific size, a specific design - that is, with a roof - it locks us into every single dollar of cost overruns and, indeed, penalties for non-delivery.

How is it that someone can agree to something that is a concept that has never been assessed, approved or even had advice on it in relation to how deliverable it is? It is no surprise that trust is so low. Opposition is high to the stadium in the north and the north-west, in the mid-to-high 60 per cent across those regions. Opposition is at 55 per cent in the south. It is hardly surprising. Tasmanians do not like being dictated to, being bullied and blackmailed, and they certainly do not like being shafted. 

The Tasmanian Planning Commission panel has determined that this stadium will add $1.86 billion of debt to our books in 10 years' time. Hobart is hardly a democratic, accessible or affordable location for footy fans in the north of the state. At a time when we have crises in health, housing and education, where we cannot even fund proper care for our kids, it is unconscionable to be spending this kind of money on this kind of money on this kind of project when those kind of crises are hitting us. I know all of us know this. We all know the feedback. We all get the receptions. A lot of us are out there door knocking as part of the federal election at the moment. A lot of us are getting emails in our inboxes. The feedback is clear. It is abundantly clear that the community do not like it.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.2_D=29.7_C=0.80] The unilateral prescription of the AFL and the acquiescence of the Premier to this stadium, in this place, in this size creates massive planning, construction and operating challenges. The challenges were really writ large in last week's draft Integrated Assessment Report from the Tasmanian Planning Commission. The Planning Commission spent a year considering the Macquarie Point stadium. They published draft guidelines, they sought public comment,  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.1_D=28.7_C=0.77] they published final guidelines, they got the POSS application from the Macquarie Point Development Corporation (MPCD), and they got five lots of additional information from the proponent, the Macquarie Point Development Corporation, on request from the Planning Commission Panel. They have had a lot of time to consider this development.

Their analysis is now out for public comment. It is notionally out for public comment unless that process is terminated. The Premier appears now to have  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=89.4_D=4.3_C=0.48] said that he will not bring special legislation before this House until 8 May. What  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=95.4_D=6.6_C=0.69] that does is that it completely treats people with contempt. Not only does that not guarantee public hearing [Bookmark: Phr6_O=102.3_D=26.5_C=0.77] s, but all of those people who are penning their public submissions, their representations on the Planning Commission Report - when you have the Liberal Party and the Labor Party lockstep in coalition wanting to back this in, come what may, how do those people feel? How do you think those thousands of Tasmanians who may be writing their submissions feel about that? It is complete contempt.

Let me quickly run through some of the things that the Macquarie Point Development Corporation  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=130.0_D=7.0_C=0.69] were assessed by the Planning Commission and what the Planning Commission actually said. 'The costs outweigh the benefits.' They said:

The Panel finds that the costs of the Project are approximately double its estimated benefits. 

'$1.86 billion debt in 10 years and a risk to our credit rating', I quote:

The additional debt the State would take on to build the Project and to fund its operating losses may trigger a credit rating downgrade. The Panel calculates that by the end of 10 years of operation the additional debt due entirely to the Project build would be approximately $1.86 billion.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=165.9_D=5.2_C=0.62] Impacts on heritage, including the Cenotaph:

The Panel considers that the built form of the stadium would have a significant detrimental effect on the visual amenity of the Cenotaph and the way it is understood and experienced. 

…

The Panel considers that both the proposed built form and the use of the stadium building would have a significant detrimental effect on the historical cultural heritage and community values of the Cenotaph. 

…

The Panel does not consider that these effects on the Cenotaph, arising from the scale, height, form, bulk, use and proximity of the stadium building, could be resolved by design details applied to the proposed stadium building.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=201.9_D=26.5_C=0.82] …

Comments from Heritage Tasmania noted that the Cenotaph would be heavily impacted by the proposal and its social and landmark qualities would be greatly diminished.

On toxic pollution, the panel says:

Overall, the Panel finds that the limited understanding of the current contamination conditions of the site, and the consequent uncertainty on contamination and disposal requirements are likely to affect the cost and timeframes of construction.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=233.9_D=27.8_C=0.74] There are significant amounts of uncertainty flagged there. Analysis and remediation that has been done on the Macquarie Point site was done for the previous development plan. It was not done for a development that includes massive levels of excavation, including for a three-storey underground car park. 

On flooding:

The Panel considers there is likelihood that the reliance on overland flow paths to manage stormwater during flood events may intensify flooding in the nearby area, particularly in the vicinity of the intersections of Davey Street with Hunter and Campbell Streets.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=267.1_D=29.8_C=0.80] There is one last one I have picked out here, and it is evacuation:

… the Panel considers that the proposed site design for Macquarie Point, as detailed in the Precinct Plan, would not provide sufficient space for the adequate achievement of emergency egress, emergency vehicle movement, general pedestrian movements, and safe and pleasant public spaces.

That is an absolute condemnation of this stadium project. I could go on. There are issues around historic and cultural heritage, issues around traffic, issues around pedestrians and issues around marine pollution [Bookmark: Phr16_O=297.1_D=7.9_C=0.60]  of the Derwent River in this clean state.

I will hold it there because I know all of us in this place should have read the Tasmanian Planning Commission's report. Many of these issues have already been canvassed in Dr Gruen's report. He said that this project shows all the hallmarks of mismanagement. The costs are understated, the benefits overstated. He was an independent assessor or commentator commissioned by government and his report has been rejected out of hand. That is what the Planning Commission has published in its draft integrated impact assessment. We as the public are being asked to comment on that at the moment.

To the specifics of the motion. In response to the Tasmanian Planning Commission report - which took over a year to conclude to get to this point, in terms of those guidelines and then the assessment - it took the Planning Commission and their multinational legal company just three days to commission legal advice to try to undermine that independent panel and make the case that: 'Little weight should be given to the Planning Commission.'

The legal advice is shallow, it tackles few legal points of genuine contention, and then it basically reads like a Liberal Party media release. This is purported to be a representation that would be fired into the process along with public submissions. The MPDC had until 8 May to get it in. It was publicly released accompanied by a media release from a proponent. It is very clear that this legal advice is little more than a PR strategy. It is a PR strategy to throw shade on the independent report of the Tasmanian Planning Commission and its findings. That is a real shame. It questions the credibility of their analysis. It is all about giving cover for the Premier - with the support of the Labor Party I might add, who have written a blank cheque - to abandon the POSS process, despite all of its work, and introduce new fast track legislation. It is important to know how this legal advice came about, and the government instructions that sit behind it. That is what this motion is seeking to do.

We want to order the government to produce correspondence before tomorrow afternoon, so that we can consider this. We have chosen that time because there is not a lot of information here that needs to be collected. Before the Adjournment tomorrow should be adequate time for the government to produce the correspondence it has had between departments, MinterEllison, Macquarie Point Development Corporation, and the like. I will not go through each of the points. I have read it into the Hansard.

Clearly, this is all about trying to understand the instructions that MinterEllison has received in terms of the construction - let us call it what it is, it is a constructed, confected piece of legal advice. It is all about trying to seek the instructions that sort that legal advice.

Let me remind you about the Tasmanian Planning Commission panel before I go on. They are hardly a bunch of woke lefty NIMBYs. They include the former assistant solicitor-general who has had a career advising government on matters of law and a former secretary of Tasmania's Department of Treasury and Finance who should know a thing or two about finance and economics. It also has an experienced planner, an experienced architect and an experienced administrator on there. This is a panel that has significant levels of expertise, but it seems they got it wrong according to this advice.

As it turns out, the very issues which the legal advice that has been commissioned raise, which the Macquarie Point Development Corporation put in its release, and which have then been echoed and replicated in this Chamber, had actually been discussed at length between the Macquarie Point Development Corporation and the Tasmanian Planning Commission, way back in January. Presumably they have been discussed at length across what, December and January?

On 22 January, John Ramsay, the Chairman of the Tasmanian Planning Commission, wrote to the Macquarie Point Development Corporation and made it really clear. I will read into the Hansard that he wrote:

I refer to the discussions between the Macquarie Point Development Corporation and TPC staff last week to clarify matters related to the TPC request for further information concerning the Mac Point Multi-Purpose Stadium.

One matter raised was the scope of the project and the POSS assessment outlined in the guidelines.

I attach here to a document that outlines the rationale for the Commission's determination of the scope of the assessment as reflected in the guidelines. 

As it turns out, one of the central arguments in the Macquarie Point Development Corporation's legal advice has already been done to death in conversations between Macquarie Point Development Corporation and the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission wrote a very detailed brief to articulate exactly why it is the scope of the project in the guidelines and the assessment is as it is. I am completely convinced that they got it right, because, let us be clear, one of the key arguments of this legal advice is that anything other than the stadium itself - anything other than the actual stadium - should not be assessed. It should not be part of this assessment and therefore the Planning Commission's erred in law and it is straight outside the boundary of the black line that they have drawn. 

I refer us all to the order that passed this House back in October 2023, and it says that:

(4)	Nature of Project. The project declared under clause 3 includes, but is not limited to, the development and construction of -

a stadium that is suitable for a range of entertainment, sporting, cultural, corporate and community uses; and

the related infrastructure and services necessary to support the stadium and its operations; and

a public concourse adjacent to the stadium; and

any other facility or thing or necessary or convenient for the implementation of the project.

It is really clear that the order that passed this House, with or without our support, Mr Willie, was clear about what the assessment should contain, and it should actually contain the things that mean that this stadium can operate. 

Why on earth would you build a stadium if people cannot get to it or if the buses cannot get to it? It is a logical piece of instructions when it comes to the assessment. I do not recall there being any pushback to that part of the order being debated within this House. It is incredibly sensible.

Then there is the ministerial direction itself, from none other than Premier Rockliff. Premier Rockliff has issued the direction to the Macquarie Point Development Corporation and the State Policies and Projects Act and it says:

As part of the integrated assessment, the Commission is to specifically consider the extent to which the project is consistent with and supports the urban renewal of Macquarie Point site as provided in the Mac Point Precinct plan, impacts on surrounding area and uses and that it could generate social, economic and cultural benefits to the region and state of Tasmania. 

I want to touch on that very plan. We have deep concerns that the only document that is written into that order that the Macquarie Point Development Corporation needs to be assessed against was the Macquarie Point Precinct plan written by the proponent itself. There is certain conflict of interest embedded in that but putting that aside, this is now the law and this is now the process by which this assessment is going.

Let me go to the transport page, page 33 of the Macquarie Point Precinct plan:

Transport Concept. The overall stadium transport concept for the site operation is outlined below an adjacent diagram. Initial analysis has highlighted merit in progressing the development and staged implementation of the Rapid Bus network and ferry network expansion, as well as walking and cycling upgrades in advance of the stadium opening.

Where is the planning, funding and roll out of the Rapid Bus network? This government has sat on its hand for 11 years now, talked the big game about the rail corridor out to the northern suburbs, and done diddly squat. This is the very plan against which this stadium is going to be assessed and it says that it should be done in advance of the stadium opening. 

It has not even been funded and there is no development application for it. It is just ridiculous. Further, number 2 in the cycling upgrades, let me just pick on that because we are going to hear from the minister himself soon. Remember the transport concept says, '… as well as walking and cycling upgrades.' This is the government that stripped $170,000 promised funding to the Hobart City Council for the Collins Street bike lane, part of the cycling network, part of the Greater Hobart Cycling Plan that this very document references. It just does not stack up and that is why there are fundamental failures with the planning for this stadium.

I will just pick one more point out of this, and that is in relation to coaches. It says, 'Queen's Domain is the preferred area for drop-off parking and pick-up with walking route available via the Bridge of Remembrance.' In Estimates last year, I asked the minister, Mr Street, and Ms Beach about the coach parking because I know the Domain pretty well. I know that the government does not own it. I know the Hobart City Council owns it. I know that there is not a lot of spare space there and if you were going to clear a bunch of parking spots for buses, that would probably cut into some really important grassland. I asked: 'Where are you at with that particular part of the Macquarie Point Development Corporation?' It was taken on notice and on the 3 October last year, I got this response:

The Queen's Domain is identified in the Mac Point Precinct Plan as a preferred coach drop-off and pick up location, in acknowledgement of its close walking proximity to the Macquarie Point site. The specific location at the Queen's Domain has not been explored and will be determined in consideration of and consultation with other users in that area.

The very thing that is in this plan, the only document against which this stadium is to be assessed, as of 3 October last year, they had not even done any work on it. They had not even started a conversation with the Hobart City Council who owns it. 

I thought I would check in a couple of weeks ago when the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was in a dialogue with the Chair and the Macquarie Point Development Corporation (MPDC), and I asked for a question to be asked on my behalf, and the question was:

I understand that part of the precinct plan identified a coach pick-up and drop-off at the domain. Can you update the committee on where the discussions with the Hobart City Council are at regarding that?

Ms Beach came back and said:

I might need to take that on notice. I am not sure that we have resolved the specific coach drop-off. We do have the event plaza, the everyday bus drop-off. I think we have not yet resolved the coach specific drop-off.

That was about two weeks ago. Mr Willie, can you confirm, the last PAC meeting when you had MPDC there and at that point, even though it is after the submission of their POSS application, they still had not done any work on a fundamental part of the Mac Point Development Plan. This is the only plan against which they are going to be assessed. This POSS application is incomplete. It is self-evident that it is utterly incomplete, and this legal advice, commissioned by a multinational legal firm, is little more than a PR exercise to muddy the waters and to create a smokescreen behind which the Premier can move special legislation that cuts out public hearing, treats the community with contempt, ignores the expertise of the Planning Commission, and rubber stamps the stadium come what may. It is really obvious why. 

It is because the stadium has so many problems that no amount of tinkering and no amount of design amendment can fix. It simply cannot be fixed because it is the wrong development in the wrong place, and that is why we need this information. That is why we need to know what sits behind the legal advice that has been produced and released to the public by the Macquarie Point Development Corporation.

We need to know about the discussions and the conversations that informed that advice. We need transparency on this issue because it is the least that this House deserves as we go into the space where we are going to be considering special legislation, that is really clear, and it is the least the public deserve as they get cut out of the planning process for this stadium.

No one in this place, as far as I am aware, is a planning expert, and that is why we need to see the substance that sits behind this legal advice. It is little more than PR.

We have a good track record of transparency in this place, and we have collectively ordered the government to produce documents on other issues in the past. In May 2023, back when Labor opposed the stadium, this House passed quite a similar motion. Then-Labor leader, Rebecca White, moved an order for the Premier to table the unredacted copies of and I quote:

Agreements and any associated documents pertaining to the deal to secure a Tasmanian AFL licence; and

Advice from the Department of Treasury and Finance pertaining to the development of a new stadium in Hobart.

Of course, that AFL licence, that dud deal, was ultimately tabled and it was ultimately released to the public, and it was illuminating regarding the commitments that Tasmania and the Premier had signed us up to for the stadium: every dollar of cost overruns, a whole bunch of penalties for delays and the like. Unfortunately, advice from the Department of Treasury and Finance pertaining to the development of a new stadium in Hobart was not forthcoming because there was no advice. That brings eternal shame to this government and the Premier. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=24.6_C=0.75]  

All this was done in the name of transparency, and the Greens wholeheartedly support it because we are in the business of transparency, of representing the community and of getting this kind of information put on the public record. 

On the Spirits, in November last year, the now opposition leader, Mr Winter, successfully moved an order for the Premier to table [Bookmark: Phr3_O=55.6_D=5.7_C=0.88]  - 

A list of local content spending to date for the new Spirits and the total value of those purchases; and [Bookmark: Phr4_O=61.9_D=29.0_C=0.77] 

An unredacted copy of the 2015 Treasury review of the potential merging of TasPorts and Tasmania Rail. 

Therefore, it is within the power of this House to order the disclosure of these kinds of documents. It is within the power of the Labor Party to support transparency measures like the ordering of these kinds of documents. It is in the public interest, it is in our collective interest as members to get this information so that we can do [Bookmark: Phr5_O=91.0_D=1.1_C=0.38]  our job properly [Bookmark: Phr6_O=92.8_D=24.6_C=0.78] . It is clear we are going to be asked to pass special fast-track legislation to approve the stadium despite the manifest issues identified by the planning experts, despite the risk to our city, our people and the environment, and despite the big risk to the state's long-term finances. 

We are going to be asked to pass this legislation [Bookmark: Phr7_O=118.7_D=6.4_C=0.56]  for a stadium and, at the end of the day, disregard this kind of [Bookmark: Phr8_O=125.8_D=29.7_C=0.85]  detailed information from the planning commission based on flimsy, so-called legal advice from a multinational company that was cooked up in a matter of days. The least we can do is inform ourselves about the genesis of this advice and the conversations that commissioned it. We found out from Mr Abetz that taxpayers are paying this firm $3.3 million. I am happy to stand corrected, minister, but according to your [Bookmark: Phr9_O=155.9_D=29.9_C=0.81]  answer last night, we have already paid this firm $600,000 and we are on the hook for another $2.7 million for legal advice. I can only assume it is this firm because this is the firm that has been contracted by Crown Law. 

Taxpayers are paying $3.3 million for this firm to be part of the process. They have lobbed a bomb into the process, blowing up the planning commission, despite its expertise, despite the fact that this House less than two years ago [Bookmark: Phr10_O=186.2_D=29.4_C=0.81]  entrusted the TPC with the process. They have lobbed a bomb simply because they know the stadium will never get approval because the problems associated with it are so profound that they cannot be fixed. The least the government can do is afford the taxpayer, who will pay $3.3 million for this advice, some transparency [Bookmark: Phr11_O=215.8_D=29.9_C=0.77]  about the instructions it gave this firm in order to publish this kind of PR cover for the Premier to move special fast-track legislation to approve a stadium that Tasmanians do not want, do not need and cannot afford. 

I remind the House that we are in a cost-of-living crisis, as well as other crises. Our health system is failing. We cannot house the [Bookmark: Phr12_O=246.1_D=24.6_C=0.80]  people who need housing, when housing is a human right. We have an ever-growing public housing wait list and people are waiting longer. We have an education system with some of the worst results in the country and we have a child support system that is straining at the seams and massively underfunded. Meanwhile, our community services organisations [Bookmark: Phr13_O=271.5_D=3.5_C=0.73]  know they are not going to get the funding they have put in their submissions [Bookmark: Phr14_O=275.4_D=26.7_C=0.87]  for the coming budget round.

We know there are many significant problems with this stadium. The experts at the planning commission have had an initial go at it and identified a raft of different problems. We know people are out there in the community currently penning their submissions to this process [Bookmark: Phr15_O=302.9_D=1.8_C=0.66]  in the knowledge that they will never get read by the people who are actually going to make the decision. It is not like every member in this House is reading every email they get from constituents, so I doubt members will read the representations the public send in. 

That is why it is important that we order the government to table the information that is the genesis of this legal advice. It is in the interest of transparency. It is in the interests of knowing what is going on. It is in the interest of informing us all as we come back into this place at some time in the future to give a defining vote on the future of this problematic proposal.

[5.02 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Minister for Business, Industry and Resources) - Deputy Speaker, one thing we have known all along is that the Greens oppose the stadium no matter what. That is why they oppose the Project of State Significance process. They voted against the actual process they are now championing. That exposes the hollowness of this debate and the seeking to bring a matter of transparency before the House.

The Greens will look for any opportunity to put a negative case about the stadium - a stadium that will be an iconic gateway to our city, provide the opportunity for cultural events, sporting events, concerts and international conferences. The facilitation there will be substantial. We know the benefits. It is interesting that Mr Bayley seeks to quote the Gruen report, the 44 cents in the dollar, yet this expert commission said it was going to be 50-something cents in the dollar. Which is it? You cannot say that you champion the cause of both these experts and they should be both taken as holy writ  when they are so diverse in their opinions.

KPMG was of the view that there would be a return of 69 cents in the dollar. If you use that metric simply of dollar return - and I warn all members about this, if that becomes your metric, if that becomes your test, no roads would be built in Tasmania with federal funding. It would all be in Melbourne and Sydney because that is where you get the biggest return on your dollar. Why? There are more people on the roads and, therefore, there is the bigger and better return. Tasmania would only have one hospital on the basis of that metric. 

Be very careful for what you wish, because what is quite apparent is that the Greens will grab at any argument in a desire to sink the stadium. The one thing lacking in their argument is integrity and consistency. It would be interesting to hear the Greens argue their case that somehow having a stadium in the city is fundamentally flawed and undemocratic. In the vast state of Western Australia, guess where the stadium is? It is not in Port Hedland or Broome or elsewhere. No, it is in the city of Perth. To make a viable stadium, it has to be in the capital city, or a city of substantial significance, which is Hobart. It is the capital city. 

Having opposed the POSS process, we now have the Greens championing the POSS process. I cannot understand how Mr Bayley, to his great credit, kept a straight face throughout his speech. I am reminded that the vast majority of his speech was only to condemn the stadium, hardly anything to do with the actual motion before us in relation to transparency.

Let us come to the Gruen report. It has now become apparent, not courtesy of the evil Murdoch press but courtesy of the ABC, which the Greens champion so often as being vital to the democratic fabric of our society, It was the ABC that revealed that prior to Dr Gruen's appointment for this as an independent assessor, he had been asked by a staffer in the Jacqui Lambie Network  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=26.0_D=4.7_C=0.63] who, guess what, used to work or still is working - I am not sure which, but for many [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.2_D=29.7_C=0.81]  years was associated with a Greens leftwing think tank, the Australia Institute. 

She suggested to Dr Gruen that he should talk to a range of people, and she then listed this range of people so that he could get a feel for the project that he might be asked to undertake on behalf of the Jacqui Lambie Network. Guess what? You go through the list and they are all  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=61.5_D=25.9_C=0.68] opponents of the stadium. This was not declared by Dr Gruen, which, in anybody's language, allows everybody to say there is or was apprehended bias. 

For somebody who is called upon to undertake a task of independent assessment, who before undertaking that task has a whistle-stop visit and  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=88.1_D=9.2_C=0.73] talks only to those on the other side and does not disclose this, and when it is pointed out to him he blames the [Bookmark: Phr6_O=97.8_D=2.3_C=0.47]  executive assistant and does not apologise  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=101.7_D=11.3_C=0.80] for the oversight, though she only put in all the people who were visited and spoken to  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=114.5_D=22.6_C=0.79] during his actual reporting or after his actual commissioning to do the report - let us be very clear, I think anybody with half an objective mind would have said Dr Gruen should have recused himself from this. 

He should have said at the very outset  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=138.2_D=7.2_C=0.79] there may be a genuine concern of apprehended bias because I have only associated with  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=146.2_D=28.0_C=0.72] the Roland Brownes of this world and we know his political allegiance and good luck to him, and we have a democratic society. He is entitled to do what he does, but let us not suggest that Dr Gruen came to this completely unbiased and with clean hands. I think the concept of apprehended bias is well understood.

To compound this further,  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=175.7_D=2.3_C=0.43] the Tasmanian Planning Commission  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=179.1_D=8.2_C=0.71] swallowed the Dr Gruen report and basically regurgitated it in their report,  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=188.3_D=18.9_C=0.78] although he was not a relevant agency. It was not appropriate for the commission to seek this report, which we now have to accept, I think on any objective basis, was tainted, or at least tainted with apprehended bias.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=208.7_D=6.0_C=0.86] Let us have a look at some of the things that this so-called issues paper dealt with.  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=216.3_D=24.1_C=0.75] As a draft assessment report, as an issues paper, it should have come forward with, 'On the one hand, this; on the other hand, that', and therefore we want to hear submissions in relation to how we might resolve these issues. No, no, no. The issues paper said white, black [Bookmark: Phr16_O=241.4_D=5.0_C=0.77]  - we have come down on the side of black and we are interested in your views.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=247.0_D=29.4_C=0.80] That suggests they have already made their determination and it is not an issues paper. 

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ABETZ - That is where the MinterEllison legal opinion is so strong and so robust. It might be a multinational firm, but does that in any way, shape or form undermine the robustness and integrity of the legal opinion?  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=277.0_D=26.3_C=0.77] Not at all. Indeed, Mr Bayley could not lay a glove on it for very good reason, because it is robust, it is good, it stands for itself, and it is very obvious. 

Mr Bayley - Show us the conversation that set it up then. 

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order, Mr Bayley.

Mr ABETZ - It is very obvious. The observations that they made about the report show that the report is exceptionally [Bookmark: Phr19_O=304.3_D=0.5_C=0.12]  defective. Allow me to go to one area of the report. It suggests that events should not negatively impact on traffic. We can call the TPC the Grinch, because you know what? If that is the test, we would not have the Christmas pageant, would we, because of impacts on traffic. We would not have the Wooden Boat Festival. We would not have the Anzac Day march, because it impacts on traffic. For a planning body to make those sorts of statements, with respect, makes me very concerned about their draft report and backs in fully the observations made by MinterEllison in their legal opinion.

The benefits of the AFL team are inconsistently treated in the report as well. Appendix D of the TPC's report explicitly says the stadium and AFL team are linked and cannot be separated when assessing the project. The benefits are explicitly excluded in the report. They say you have to consider them together and then they discount any benefit. One of the benefits is not a small amount of money. It is a benefit of $360 million that the AFL will invest around the state of Tasmania in local football at a lick of $36 million a year over a decade. Simply discounted. One assumes there is an inconvenient truth for Dr Gruen and, as a result, an inconvenient truth for the TPC.

Those of us who engage within our communities - I know that with the Kingborough Tigers, I know with the Lauderdale football club, the uptake in Auskick by our young children in our community is huge.

Mr Bayley - Without a stadium.

Mr ABETZ - The enrolments have doubled. It is exactly the same as what occurred with basketball, with the JackJumpers and the development of the Derwent Entertainment Centre at that time.

Can I say that for anybody who wants to look at the social benefits of the stadium, ask anybody involved in law enforcement. They will tell you: show me a suburb where there is a high rate of youth participation in sport and I will show you a suburb with a low rate of youth crime. They are the sort of social benefits that are just swept away and completely not considered by the TPC.

Ms Rosol - Maybe you should invest in that instead of 'tough on crime.'

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ABETZ - I simply say to them that I am sure that they are a body of good men and women, but they have misdirected themselves and their report is fatally flawed in relation to these matters. Similarly with Dr Gruen's report - I am sure he is a good man and a good economist, but it was a terrible misjudgement on his part to consort and consult with people who were known to be against the stadium before taking on the task and then not disclosing that. In any other job, in any other situation, the concept of apprehended bias would have bowled him out immediately.

I say with respect to him, his lack of self-awareness in that regard is astounding, and then to lay the blame on his executive assistant. Even if it were the executive assistant's fault, an apology should have been forthcoming. What is more, the government should have been told. The way the government found out was that there was a quiet change on his website as to the people consulted. The ABC discovered that, and when approached, he admitted that he did not tell the government about that change. Yet it was the Tasmanian taxpayer, albeit courtesy of the Jacqui Lambie Network, that paid for that report, and if there were material changes to be made [Bookmark: Phr3_O=22.8_D=21.8_C=0.82] , worthy of amending, as it clearly was, because that is what he did, he should have notified the state government. 

His refusal, deliberate or otherwise, to not so notify, puts a huge cloud over the Gruen report [Bookmark: Phr4_O=46.6_D=10.4_C=0.83] . The TPC undoubtedly would not have been aware of Dr Gruen's consultation with others before he was appointed. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=58.9_D=16.5_C=0.82]  They would not have been aware of what I would say is the bias in the report, at least the apprehended bias in the report, when they were willing to quote him. I dare say that if they knew what we now know [Bookmark: Phr6_O=76.2_D=5.8_C=0.84] , they may have been somewhat more circumspect in quoting and relying on [Bookmark: Phr7_O=83.8_D=13.0_C=0.74]  the Gruen report. 

This stadium is going to be a game changer for this state. Politics, as it is, is a strange thing, as I was able to say on the Stateline program the other night. We had a situation where the state Liberal government [Bookmark: Phr9_O=107.2_D=27.0_C=0.81]  partnered with the federal Labor government to help deliver this, and we had a state Labor opposition and a federal Liberal opposition opposed to it. Thankfully both those oppositions have come to their senses and now back in the stadium. We now have the situation of the lack of opportunism or the dispensing of opportunism by oppositions [Bookmark: Phr10_O=135.5_D=18.4_C=0.66]  and both of them - and I am trying to be as bipartisan as I possibly can in this regard - have accepted that opposition for opposition's sake is not the way to go for the future. 

I commend Labor for changing their policy [Bookmark: Phr11_O=154.5_D=25.9_C=0.77] . We will keep stirring you about that from time to time, as is reasonable, as I am sure you will stir us about other things. Similarly, federally, I am sure the Labor people up there stir my former colleagues as to their backflip. The important thing is that there is recognition on both sides of politics, state and federal, that this is a project [Bookmark: Phr12_O=181.2_D=4.7_C=0.91]  worthy of support because it will be so instrumental [Bookmark: Phr13_O=186.3_D=29.8_C=0.74]  in changing what, and you will not often get me quoting Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, but on this occasion he acknowledged that it is an industrial wasteland with a sewerage works that is about 115 years old, and has had basically nothing going for it for the past decade or more.

Mr Bayley - Apart from the plan you signed off on last time.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ABETZ - It has been sitting there idle, doing nothing other than being [Bookmark: Phr14_O=216.3_D=30.0_C=0.79]  an eyesore as the gateway to our city. We can transform and we will transform. I have no doubt that as people see this project moving, they will say this is a good project. I do not know what it is about the wonderful Australian people, but we do seem to like to have negativity for big projects. There was negativity towards [Bookmark: Phr15_O=246.7_D=29.4_C=0.77]  the Townsville Stadium -

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ABETZ - towards the Perth Stadium, towards the Adelaide Stadium, to Federation Square in Melbourne. If you went to any of those places today and said what a terrible decision it was to build a stadium in Townsville or Federation Square in Melbourne, you would be drummed out of town. They would be saying, 'You are a fool. What are you talking about? This has been transformational. This has been [Bookmark: Phr16_O=276.6_D=27.1_C=0.80]  a fantastic change for our state. It is a wonderful initiative.' I have every confidence that very shortly the naysayers to this project will simply be a  footnote in history. They are naysayers for opportunistic reasons without any genuine regard for the prospects of the stadium project. 

Saying, 'I support an AFL team but I do not support the stadium' is disingenuous and people know it to be disingenuous - or I trust people in this place know that when they say that they are being disingenuous, because the AFL have made it clear that without a stadium they cannot support a team. That is because a team needs a dynamic new facility that Tasmania, unfortunately, cannot offer at either Bellerive or York Park. Those who say, 'Oh, just whack a roof on Bellerive', or whatever, do not talk about all the problems that would be associated with an attempt to retrofit those two venues. If it could be done, I am sure the AFL would say, 'Yep, we can make this team work without us having to poke our own money into the capital cost.' Keep in mind that the AFL will put not only the $360 million into community football, but also $15 million into the capital cost of the stadium.

You also have the high-performance centre that is going to be built down my way in Kingston. The local member in the upper House, Meg Webb, is opposing the stadium. Acting Deputy Speaker, I am not reflecting on, but am promoting and acknowledging the vote that occurred in the upper House last night, where four to 10 -

Dr Woodruff - That sounds like reflecting on the matters of another House to me. Very much so.

Mr ABETZ - they refused Meg Webb's motion, and quite rightly so. Without a stadium - 

Dr Woodruff - That sounds like reflecting on a vote as well; giving an opinion about it.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff. 

Mr ABETZ - there will not be a high-performance centre in Kingston. To try to claim that, somehow, she is supportive of an AFL team but not the stadium means that she opposes the high-performance centre, or the training and administration centre in Kingston. These are some of the matters that need to be put on the table and there has to be consistency and integrity in the argument. Let us be clear: if there is no Macquarie Point Stadium, there will be no AFL team for Tasmania, or should I say, AFL teams plural, because there will be the AFL and the AFLW teams as well.

In relation to MinterEllison, they were appointed by the Office of the Crown Solicitor to advise the Macquarie Point Development Corporation and the Crown on 5 July 2024. They were appointed following a competitive process involving all law firms on the Office of the Crown Solicitor's panel of external law firms. The scope of the appointment is to advise on legal matters related to the stadium project, including assisting with all aspects of the Project of State Significance process. 

Having access to expert legal advice to assist with the development and approval of a complex project like the stadium is normal practice. It is indicative of a lack of knowledge, experience and understanding of the issues of a complex development such as the stadium to think it is strange that you need high-quality lawyers, as you need high-quality other professionals, to assist, guide and advise as to how -

Dr Woodruff - Which is why we are not qualified. We are not planners. We are not qualified to make the decision.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff.

Mr ABETZ - this matter should proceed. I am sure Dr Woodruff is an expert in all matters, as we listen to her every day. However, a government that is concerned to ensure - 

Dr Woodruff - I am not an urban planner. I am not an architect.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff.

Mr ABETZ - to get actual expert advice, we seek to get that in. From time to time, the Crown Solicitor, either because of workload, the capacity aspect or the expertise aspect, will  seek advice and support from other legal firms. That is what has happened.

The planning commission process, which the Greens so vehemently opposed and are now championing, has its own source of legal advice, which it ought to. The TPC having legal advice is not an issue for the Greens. With the Macquarie Point Development Corporation, all of a sudden, that is a matter of great moment. Once again we see a lack of consistency and a lack of integrity in the argument.

Mr Bayley - Well, release the commissioning advice.

Mr ABETZ - It just does not stand up to any objective test the way they go about their advocacy.

MinterEllison was right. If you have read every single word of the draft assessment report, as I have, you can see it contains errors of law, it is argumentative, it lacks balance and relies on untested material. Anybody who has read the report would have to come to that: that there were matters they took into account which they did not tell anybody else about. Therefore, it was not tested. As a result, as an issues paper, which they claim it is, it only puts the one side because they did not allow anybody else to respond.

Mr Bayley - Now is the chance. 

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr Bayley, you were heard in silence. You will allow other members to speak and be heard in silence as well.

Mr ABETZ - Thank you for that protection, acting Deputy Speaker. For a draft integrated assessment, the most glaring thing about the report is that it does not indicate or include any actual draft conditions. Would you not have thought that considering all these matters, balancing them all up, they might have said, 'As a result of which we believe this might be a way to overcome this particular issue, and we would be wanting the public or other people to make submissions to talk about these matters, advise and guide and come forward with their ideas.' There is not a single draft condition.

Ms Burnet - What do you want?

Mr ABETZ - Ms Burnet asks what I want. What the people of Tasmania wanted was a genuine draft assessment which would have draft conditions. What we are now having at the very end of the process - a process they voted against, the more I come into this, having only been in this place for a year and not having had the opportunity to vote for or against the process, I think they might have been onto something in voting against the process initially. However, that was before I was in this place, so I will not reflect on my colleagues who may or may not have voted in a particular way on it.

With a draft assessment, surely you would put forward draft conditions to give some indication as to how problems that the commission assessed were there might be overcome. There were no such draft conditions or suggestions; simply that they were concerned about this, they were concerned about that. It was an exceptionally negative and argumentative document. What this means is that representations to the TPC will be distorted by shortcomings of the draft report and its failure to canvass draft conditions. This will prevent a fulsome assessment of the stadium, and active consideration of the conditions under which it would be appropriate for the project to proceed [Bookmark: Phr2_O=13.6_D=26.7_C=0.82]  - and the expansion of the project scope to double the footprint of the actual stadium area. I say to the Greens, be careful what you wish for because what this does is suspend the planning process not only for the stadium area now, but for double the area. 

Another one of the problems, as I finish up with this report, is [Bookmark: Phr3_O=41.7_D=14.2_C=0.79]  that they talked about the northern access road, a road which will need to be built irrespective of the stadium going ahead, to service the port. Somehow that gets lumbered in with the stadium as an extra cost.

Time expired.

[5.32 p.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) -  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=64.5_D=29.0_C=0.81] Deputy Speaker, I have been enjoying myself over there in my seat. This debate has been very interesting to observe. You have the Greens on one hand talking up a process that they voted against. The Greens love process when it works for them; they love lawfare, they love tying things up when it works for them. What happens when the process does not work for them? [Bookmark: Phr5_O=94.1_D=30.0_C=0.67]  They attack the process.

Dr Woodruff - We do not know; it does the work for us. It has not finished yet.

Mr Bayley - That is where third-party legal rights are really important.

Mr WILLIE - It is hilarious listening to you now talking up POSS and the experts on the Planning Commission - 

Dr Woodruff - The alternative is so much worse.

Mr WILLIE - because you think the process is working for you.

I have the same criticism of the government. The government talked up the POSS process. You had the Premier saying this is going to go through a rigorous economic, social and environmental assessment. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=124.2_D=3.4_C=0.71]  Is this not great? We have this fantastic process. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=129.6_D=13.2_C=0.73]  I must admit there were lots of people who had doubts about the process. I believe about eight projects have gone into this process and only two have ever come out, one of them being Basslink. I think another was a mine on the west coast. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=144.1_D=26.1_C=0.78] 
You had the Premier talking up the process and trying to sell how good it was going to be. Now you have the government attacking the process, attacking the Planning Commission, and attacking Dr Gruen, and the report that was commissioned by the government in exchange for support from the Jacqui Lambie Network. If you go back to the start of the POSS process, that was [Bookmark: Phr9_O=171.6_D=9.6_C=0.72]  a price extracted from the government for John Tucker and Lara Alexander's support for the government to continue after they defected and the government fell into minority. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=183.2_D=12.6_C=0.65]  It has been a very interesting debate to listen to you both today. You are both hypocritical in your positions and you are now trying to swap over because it is convenient to you. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=196.8_D=9.7_C=0.70] 

The matter before us is about the production of documents. I have not heard much debate about the substance of the [Bookmark: Phr12_O=207.8_D=27.8_C=0.81]  motion. I said this before in this House: I was fortunate to sit on a committee in the other place on an inquiry into the production of documents. New members in this House should definitely pick that report up and have a read. It is an instruction manual on the powers of parliament to order the production of documents, the powers of committees to send for people and papers and order the production of documents [Bookmark: Phr13_O=236.4_D=2.5_C=0.71] .

There are some [Bookmark: Phr14_O=239.5_D=23.6_C=0.81]  principles explained in that report, things like responsible government. Responsible government, for newer members, does not mean the government being responsible. We have seen that they are not, particularly managing the state's finances or building a berth at Devonport. What responsible government means is that the executive sits in the parliament and is accountable to the parliament. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=264.3_D=4.0_C=0.77]  They have a right to make collective decisions, Cabinet decision [Bookmark: Phr16_O=268.7_D=3.4_C=0.85] s, and they also have a right to claim privilege [Bookmark: Phr17_O=273.4_D=26.1_C=0.81]  over certain documents.

I take the power to order for papers and the production of documents very seriously. I think that parliament has an explicit right to do that, whether it is in the other place or here. They are in minority, so we do have that power if the House so supports. I know that one day we might be sitting over there, hopefully sooner rather than later [Bookmark: Phr18_O=301.0_D=3.8_C=0.82] . The government has a right to claim privilege over certain matters. Cabinet deliberations is an obvious one. Sometimes, there is commercial-in-confidence that is claimed. Legal privilege is sometimes claimed.

Mr Bayley - They have released the advice with a media release.

Mr WILLIE - You can respond in a moment, member for Clark. The government has the right to claim that immunity. If you read the Production of Documents report, this parliament has not tested some of these dynamics in the way that other parliaments have. Other parliaments have updated their Standing Orders to put in formal processes around some of this stuff.

Dr Woodruff - What a lot of rubbish. What a lot of confected nonsense.

Mr WILLIE - It is actually a fundamental principle of Westminster democracy. It is interesting for a member of this place to say that the principles around the production of documents is a load of rubbish, when they sit in the Westminster Parliament.

Dr Woodruff - Desperately trying to just make an excuse not to make stuff public.

Mr WILLIE - No, that is not what I am saying at all. I am saying that there is a right to do this, but there is also a right for the government to claim privilege. If they do claim privilege, I would like to see detailed reasons why they are claiming privilege; an explanation to the House. It does not mean that the House at a later time does not have a right to challenge the explanation and the claim of privilege.

Dr Woodruff - Are you going to support the motion?

Mr WILLIE - I am talking about the production of documents, which is what your motion is about.

The SPEAKER - The members will cease their interjections. The member has the call.

Mr WILLIE - Other parliaments have put in processes. Some have a third party arbiter to check the claims of privilege and whether there is merit to what the government is saying or not, and they can provide advice. There are options for the government to provide documents in camera if they are sensitive, and members could challenge the sensitivity of those in other forums. These are all things that have happened in other parliaments. This parliament has not gone to the same extent in these sorts of matters.

I support transparency. I think there is nothing wrong with the parliament ordering the production of documents, but I do think government has a right to claim immunity.

In terms of these documents and what the Greens are up to, we know that they are trying to do everything they can to stop this project. They have criticised us, which is a funny approach when you are trying to seek support for a motion, to criticise for half your speech the people you want to support the motion. They criticised us for supporting the AFL teams, unashamedly, acknowledging that the timelines in the agreement are what they are and the stadium is necessary to deliver those.

There is a big difference between approval and delivery. Whilst we will support approval of a stadium, we will certainly hold this government to account for delivery. We know on that front they have very poor form. We know the Premier has made very explicit promises to Tasmanians - around $375 million and not a red cent more. It is up to him to come and explain to this parliament and to Tasmanians how he is going to deliver on that. I think he said it nearly a hundred times.

We want to see this Premier address some of the concerns being raised by the Planning Commission. There are legitimate concerns there. I know the government is trying to discredit the entire report. That is their right, but I think there are some legitimate concerns being raised by the Planning Commission, and this government needs to address some of those.

There is a big difference between approval and delivery. We know when this government makes major commitments around major projects, sometimes they do not deliver it on the timeframes they have promised. This is a government that spent a billion dollars on two new ships and did not upgrade the ports for them to go into service. It means that Tasmania has become a national embarrassment, a laughing stock, if you like. At an international level there have been people making fun of this state government for stuffing something up so badly. We have major concerns when it comes to this government's ability to deliver major projects and we will certainly be holding them to account through the forums of the parliament.

I thought that the leader of government business may have moved an amendment to this motion, and he did not, so I have one myself and I will circulate that.
The SPEAKER - Are you moving the amendment and speaking to it now?

Mr WILLIE - Yes. I move -

Insert new paragraph (e)

(e)	Notes that whilst the House has the power to order the production of documents, the government can claim immunity under some circumstances and should provide detailed reasons why any of the above cannot be provided.

As I said just earlier, if the government does claim immunity, they need to provide detailed reasons to this House on why they cannot provide it and it does not prevent the House from challenging that claim.

If you are sceptical about this, and I can see the Greens are, go and read the Production of Documents inquiry report in the upper House. It is an instruction manual on how these sorts of things occur in Westminster parliaments. There is a whole range of sanctions and things that we can do to get the documents if there is no legitimate claim of immunity, and this parliament has not explored some of those things.

I am a student of Westminster. I respect Westminster parliaments and traditions and precedents. I respect the principles around responsible government and I think, for all its faults, our system of government is far better than any other form of government in the world. We are seeing political systems fall into crisis across the globe in very uncertain times at the moment, so I think we, as members of this place, need to be cognisant of hundreds of years of precedence and traditions that have served us well.

I think that if this amendment is passed, it delivers what the Greens are trying to achieve, which is the power to order the production of documents, it allows the government to work through its processes and it does not mean the matter stops here and now. It means that the government will have to come to parliament with detailed explanations and we can challenge that.

Dr Woodruff - Why not just leave it as it is and then deal with that later?

Mr WILLIE - You are not listening to what I am saying, because I believe in the principles of responsible government, and governments have a right to claim privilege at times. You may want to order every document that the government holds, but that would not be a responsible thing to do as a Westminster parliamentarian.

Dr Woodruff - We are not doing that. We are being quite moderate and reasonable.

The SPEAKER - Members of the Greens will cease interjecting. The member has the call.

Mr WILLIE - This seeks to achieve what the Greens want, which is the power to order the production of documents. It protects the government's right to claim immunity. They have to provide detailed responses to the House, and if we are not happy with those, there are a whole range of processes that we could work through and maybe set some precedents for the Tasmanian parliament. 

It is something that I am interested in, and if members want to educate themselves a bit over the break, I would encourage them to read that report, because we may be able to explore some of the things in that report.

Mr Winter - It is about 1000 pages. I had a crack at it once.

Mr WILLIE - It is a detailed report. I might leave it there because I know we are short on time, and I want to leave time for other members to contribute to the amendment that I have just moved.

The SPEAKER - We have until 6.01 p.m., if that is useful.

[5.46 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I do not need to speak to the amendment, which we will not be supporting, but thank you for the lesson in the Westminster system.

The motion that Mr Bayley has put forward is quite robust. I go to some of the points that minister Abetz made, and I want to talk about the way that [Bookmark: Phr2_O=22.4_D=7.0_C=0.86]  people would move from a stadium or a single event. We are not talking about [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.1_D=3.0_C=0.56]  a transport [Bookmark: Phr4_O=37.0_D=22.3_C=0.83]  event that has a traffic management plan already in place, such as the pageant. He brought up the Christmas pageant; it must be a favourite of his. 

Mr Abetz - It is.

Ms BURNET - I do not know if minister Abetz was at the last Ogoh-ogoh burning on 18 June 2023 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=60.7_D=26.0_C=0.75] , but I did go and it was very good, and perhaps he would like to go to the next Ogoh-ogoh burning this Dark Mofo. 

Mr Abetz - I prefer the Christmas pageant.

Ms BURNET - This year it is going to be the Maugean skate, an important contribution by Dark Mofo. The pedestrian management on the night I went, with thousands of people coming from [Bookmark: Phr6_O=87.1_D=3.8_C=0.69]  the Macquarie Point area [Bookmark: Phr7_O=92.1_D=26.0_C=0.84] , was a real case in point. It was a considerable thing to move thousands and thousands of people onto Evans Street down a closed Davey Street. It was a considerable effort to do this. There was quite a lot of congestion of traffic to the east [Bookmark: Phr8_O=118.7_D=1.5_C=0.72] . People travelling down to the south [Bookmark: Phr9_O=121.1_D=9.4_C=0.69]  were having great difficulties, so those examples that you put up, minister Abetz, [Bookmark: Phr10_O=132.2_D=17.5_C=0.82]  are flimsy examples, if I might say. 

This motion is an important motion that the Greens have put forward because we want to expose how the government is reaching its decisions on the stadium, the plausibility of any advice [Bookmark: Phr11_O=150.1_D=27.1_C=0.82]  and the paper trail that the government does not want to reveal. It is clear that they do not want to reveal where they are getting advice - what advice they pick and choose. This is unfortunately what we are seeing. 

The public have a right to know. They should be provided with transparency, which it seems is not something that is in this government's DNA. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=178.1_D=9.0_C=0.67]  This stadium is going to be one of the biggest infrastructure projects in Tasmanian history. A mega project like this needs a lot of accountability. It has a huge budget associated with it, and that is why there needs to be a lot of transparency. That is why it is so important that Mr Bayley has brought this to the House. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=206.7_D=29.4_C=0.79]  

There are huge question marks over the confidence of the government to deliver major projects, and Labor has been right on the money demanding answers in relation to the TT-Line ferries and Devonport wharf disasters. We do not even have to look too far back to see how incompetent the government has been in managing such [Bookmark: Phr15_O=236.5_D=18.1_C=0.77]  an important project to this state. 

It is unarguable that the stadium would be a very important project to this state as well. However, we need transparency. We need accountability, and it is so important that it occur [Bookmark: Phr16_O=256.2_D=0.8_C=0.72]  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=259.5_D=12.6_C=0.82] s. You can bet that there is a certain amount of bias associated with a number of people [Bookmark: Phr18_O=272.9_D=4.6_C=0.91]  in this House who are desperate to have a stadium [Bookmark: Phr19_O=278.4_D=4.4_C=0.44]  and desperate to have an AFL team [Bookmark: Phr20_O=284.6_D=5.1_C=0.81] . Their decision-making in this  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=291.7_D=12.0_C=0.83] matter about the stadium is clearly showing considerable amounts of bias. It is incumbent on this government and this House to show accountability and expect transparency. We have seen various reports - the Hobart City Council at their planning meeting tonight is considering a report. We have heard about Gruen and how he is being refuted and ongoingly undermined, which I think is really quite a questionable process [Bookmark: Phr2_O=28.7_D=0.9_C=0.89]  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.1_D=4.9_C=0.63]  that minister Abetz is undertaking.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=36.8_D=22.0_C=0.70] Saul Eslake, Graham Wells, John Lawrence and Martin Goddard have provided various reports and yet the government sees no point to them. The Greens are calling on this government to be transparent for building public trust and to show that transparency in the funding arrangements [Bookmark: Phr5_O=59.1_D=25.0_C=0.75]  for Tasmanians now, for businesses now, for the community, and it is something that the next generations should be expecting as well. This is a significant proposal and it has the potential to bankrupt the state. That is why the Greens are asking for this accountability. 

[5.53 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=86.5_D=29.5_C=0.68] Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I will be brief because I understand that the member for Clark would like to conclude. I was not going to speak on this motion, but after hearing the contribution from the leader of government business, I feel compelled to get up here. On the amendment matter, I thank Mr Willie for the lecture in the Westminster system. I understand some of the concerns he has raised; certainly claiming privilege over documents is understandable. 

However, I cannot support his amendment. I think it would have been strengthened had you listed those things we could have done if they had not provided detailed reasons or insufficient detailed reasons.  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=116.1_D=30.0_C=0.69] I think that that would have provided the actual teeth. What in fact you are doing with this amendment is providing an out, rather than some actual teeth to the motion. 

I want to touch on the contribution from the leader of government business, because I feel what has happened since the release of the Gruen Report and then subsequently the release of the TPC Draft Integrated Assessment Report is nothing short of  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=146.2_D=26.8_C=0.75] disgraceful character assassination of a number of eminent, respected experts in this area who have been engaged by the government, either directly through the government in the case of Dr Gruen or through the TPC as an expert panel for TPC, again through a process established by the government. It has been quite disgraceful. 

I want to remind the House of what the TPC have been tasked to do. The panel, consisting of Paul Turner SC, Gary Pratley, Liam Mason AM, Shelley Penn AM and Martin Wallace are indeed very well respected  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=181.6_D=16.9_C=0.72] individuals who have turned their mind to this serious and significant project for Tasmania. They were tasked with assessing a proposal by the Crown in right of Tasmania for the development of a multipurpose stadium at Macquarie Point that was declared a project of State Significance by order of the Governor.  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=199.0_D=29.4_C=0.79] This has come directly from their report. It goes on:

Under the order, the project includes development and construction of:
A stadium that is suitable for a range of entertainment, sporting, cultural, corporate and community uses

The related infrastructure and services necessary to support the stadium and its operation

A public concourse adjacent to the stadium; and

Any other facility or thing necessary or convenient for the implementation of the project. 

It is disgraceful that this government and MPDC are crying foul when the TPC panel are looking at related infrastructure and are reporting back on a draft assessment of other facilities necessary or convenient for implementation of the project. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=228.9_D=29.6_C=0.74]  They established those guidelines under order for the TPC to do this. 

Furthermore, the ministerial direction signed off by the Premier ordered that the TPC and the panel consider a number of matters. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=259.0_D=25.5_C=0.66]  The integrated assessment was to address the environmental, social, economic and community impacts of the project. It is absolutely gobsmacking that this government should cry foul now, because the TPC are doing exactly the job that they were tasked with doing, under order and ministerial direction. 

We absolutely need to see the information and advice  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=285.3_D=2.2_C=0.84] that is referred to in this motion. It is important  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=288.8_D=7.6_C=0.71] because, quite frankly, what we are seeing from this government is a desperate attempt to get out of the very big hole that it has dug itself.

The SPEAKER - Are you speaking to the amendment, Mr Bayley? I may actually give Mr Ferguson the call - I am sorry, because it was pretty close. If you can allow some time -

Dr Woodruff - Mr Bayley got the call.

The SPEAKER - No, I was being polite because I was not sure if he was attempting to take the call to sum up the debate.

Mr Bayley - It is an amendment to our motion, Speaker.

The SPEAKER - I have given Mr Ferguson the call. Ms Burnet has already spoken to the amendment on behalf of the Greens. Mr Ferguson, if you could be aware, very quickly -

Mr Ferguson - If the Speaker might guide me on the time for the debate?

The SPEAKER - It is 6.01 p.m., so we only have a couple of moments left.

Mr Ferguson - Very good. Well, if I could be permitted two minutes, I can make my points in two minutes.

 [5.57 p.m.]
Mr FERGUSON (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, first of all, I did not mind the lecture on Westminster from the shadow treasurer. I would not mind if we heard a bit more about that, because I want to make the point that the amendment from the Labor party, which I have come to understand, actually makes a bad motion less bad.

I say that from the point of view of an MP - not just a government MP, but if I were on the other side of the House, I would also want some basic conventions to be respected - like the fact that Cabinet needs to be able to receive frank and fearless advice, and to be able to do that with the public interest immunity that Mr Willie spoke about.

I will not have time to take the House through some of the appalling history of motions that have ordered different ministers and premiers to table documents which they were legally forbidden to provide. It is correct that the House can make the order, but how proper is it that the House would make a person produce documents that they are legally forbidden from producing? That is the territory that Mr Bayley's motion brings us to. Without the amendment, that is exactly where it takes this House to; a very dangerous place.

You talk about workplace courtesies and looking after people's welfare. You are putting a minister in a situation where you say to them, 'Either break the law or break your signature to a non-disclosure agreement, or breach your obligation under commercial-in-confidence - or we will drag you through Privileges and have you sacked.' That is what you are creating here. I am offended by the word 'orders' in the first part of the motion, because I know exactly that is where it takes us. I also could not help but notice two references to Crown law and legal advice in parts (b) and (d). 

Frankly, it is a reckless motion. Even though it is legitimate to want to scrutinise a big project - and I will never take that away from the Greens or any other member of this House - the motion without the amendment is reckless. For that reason I can say, on behalf of members on this side of the House, we would be inclined to support that amendment and to perhaps allow, if the motion were to pass, the relevant ministers or the Premier to be able to provide an explanation as to why certain things may not ethically or legally be able to be agreed to.
[5.59 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, we oppose the amendment because it renders the motion effectively impotent. We want the documents. We do not want the excuses. We do not want excuses as to why they cannot do this. What this does is actually lead the government to put up the excuse, which is to claim immunity.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members will cease interjecting. There is only a minute to go, or two.

Mr BAYLEY - This motion is all about transparency, and what we are getting here is a double block. We are not only getting the Liberal party blocking this, but we have the Labor party standing in front of the Premier and blocking the release of this kind of information.

Members interjecting.

Dr Woodruff - Everyone else was heard in silence.

The SPEAKER - The member will cease his contribution; everyone else will resume their seat and be quiet. If the Leader of the Greens wishes to make a reflection or call on me to do something, she may seek the call to do so. I was already calling the House to order before. The member will be heard in silence, but I will not be yelled at by members of parliament. 

Mr BAYLEY - This was never something that the Labor party put into their motions that ordered documents from the government, and yet here they are, blocking transparency on this incredibly important project.

We are going to be asked to vote on this in this House, and I will make a point about the legal privilege and putting you in a difficult position: the government has already released this legal advice together with a media release. There is nothing privileged about this, because we are not after the legal advice. You have given it to the world. You are using it as a smokescreen to bring special legislation into this House. What this amendment does -

Time expired.

The SPEAKER (Ms O'Byrne) - The motion before the House is -

That the amendment to the motion be agreed to.

I am not going to have arguments played out during the division bells being rung. People can step outside at the end of this debate if they wish to continue a forceful discussion. That applies to all members.

Before I call on the next motion, which is private members' time for Mrs Beswick both, in the calling of the division then and in an incident yesterday, members of the parliament were involved in quite aggressive or loud conversations. Debate can happen on the floor of the House, you can have aggressive conversations outside, but this has to be a safe workplace. When people have finished their contributions and resumed their seats, this has to be a safe place. I am not going to tolerate this kind of, at the end of a debate, going over to and talking to members or yelling at members across the Chamber. I do not mind a bit of cross chamber chat, we are not ridiculous, but I do not like the aggressive nature of the behaviour. 


MOTION

Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme

[6.08 p.m.]
Mrs BESWICK (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, a vote is required. I move -

That the House - 

Recognises the value of the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme (TFES) on the economic prosperity of Tasmania, in particular on the Bass Strait Islands, and in supporting comparable shipping costs with mainland Australia. 

Notes - 

the Senate Select Committee on the TFES Report (December 2024) and the Chair’s additional comments, which called for strong reform to the scheme, including - 

dedicated frontline staff located in Tasmania to assist local businesses; 

reforming the scheme to sit under one department within the Commonwealth Government, not two; 

including air freight in TFES; 

changing the way payments are distributed; and 

modernising the system to make things faster and cheaper. 

the recommendations of the Senate Committee including Recommendation 2 as follows: - 

in the review of Government Business Enterprises currently being conducted by the Tasmanian Government, the following factors be considered in consultation with key port stakeholders - 

the primary role of TasPorts be; to provide the most efficient and cost effective facilitation of trade; and 

the role of TasPorts as a shipping operator given the National Competition Policy complications and additional costs generated. 

Supports the reforms outlined in 2(a) above and commits to lobbying Federal Labor and the Coalition to commit to these reforms. 

Further notes that the terms of reference for the Select Committee on the Potential Sale of Government Businesses resolved by the House on 12 March 2025 are broad and would allow consideration of the matters set out in Recommendation 2 of the Senate Committee.

I rise today to move a motion that recognises the critical importance of the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme (TFES) to our state's economy and economic prosperity. Tasmania, and particularly our Bass Strait Islands, face a unique set of challenges when it comes to freight costs. Unlike businesses on the mainland, we do not have the luxury of simply trucking goods across state lines. We rely on shipping, a costly necessity that without proper support puts our local industries at a significant disadvantage.

Economist Saul Eslake nails it when he says:

Very few people question the fact every year the Commonwealth government allocates tens of millions of dollars to the maintenance and upgrading of the National Highway network. That's not considered a subsidy to businesses in Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria or the Northern Territory, but somehow, doing something that provides the equivalent to Tasmania is considered by people in mainland states as a subsidy.

The cost of transporting goods across Bass Strait can be a prohibitive factor for businesses looking to expand, invest, and create jobs in Tasmania. It is not simply a matter of convenience, it is a fundamental, issue of economic fairness. That is why the TFES is so vital. It ensures that our businesses, our producers and our exporters can compete on a level playing field with their mainland counterparts. It supports jobs, investment and economic growth across our island state. However, as the recent Senate Select Committee on the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme has made clear, this scheme is in urgent need of reform.

The Senate committee's report, handed down in December 2024, makes a compelling case for strong and meaningful changes to TFES. The Chair's additional comments highlight key areas where reforms are desperately needed. I strongly support these recommendations. According to the Chair, the committee tried to gain a deeper understanding of the scheme's history, its development across five decades, how it has been used by businesses both large and small, and areas where it could be more fit for purpose for those it was created to help. 

The TFES was established in 1976 to compensate Tasmanian businesses because they do not have access to National Highway and rail networks and so have to rely on shipping. Unfortunately, what was originally designed to support and strengthen our economy has over time become bogged down in inefficiencies and administrative burdens. If we do not act now to modernise and improve the scheme, we risk leaving Tasmanian businesses at an even greater disadvantage compared to their mainland competitors. This motion details what effective steps we can make today to make this happen.

First, we must have dedicated frontline TFES based staff in Tasmania. Local businesses need direct expert assistance from people who understand the complexities of our freight challenges, not bureaucrats based in Canberra detached from the realities of the ground. It is unacceptable that Tasmanian businesses must navigate bureaucratic processes controlled by people who have never had to deal with the unique logistics of freight across Bass Strait. Having a dedicated Tasmanian based team would mean faster, more effective support for businesses struggling with freight costs and administrative hurdles. 

Second, the TFES must be simplified. At present, the scheme is spread across two separate Commonwealth government departments, creating unnecessary red tape and confusion. Select Committee Chair noted that the Public Service did not seem to notice the process was in any way inefficient, duplicative or unnecessarily complex. The current system is riddled with inefficiencies that create unnecessary delays and confusion for those who rely on it the most. One department should be responsible, streamlining processes and making it easier for Tasmanian businesses to access the support that helps create a level playing field in access to markets throughout Australia and the world. When small businesses are forced to navigate complex bureaucratic structures, it reduces productivity, increases frustration and ultimately discourages economic growth. A single centralised department managing the scheme will provide much needed clarity and efficiency.

This scheme must be expanded to include air freight. For many high value, perishable or time sensitive goods, shipping is simply not a viable option, leaving businesses at a disadvantage when trying to get products to market quickly. If we are serious about supporting Tasmanian industry, this change is essential. Air freight plays a vital role in maintaining supply chains, meeting consumer demand and ensuring Tasmanian products reach their markets in peak condition.

This is especially critical for the Bass Strait islands where logistical challenges are even greater. Industries such as seafood, pharmaceuticals and specialised manufacturing depend on air freight as a fundamental part of modern business operations. The TFES must recognise this reality and include air freight to reflect the needs of contemporary trade and industry. The opportunities which would present from the expansion of TFES to air freight, such as enabling Tasmanian producers to better participate in just-in-time supply chains and accessing premium market segments that demand rapid delivery are enormous. This could lead to the transformation of Tasmania's export profile toward higher value products, skilled jobs and value added processing.

The way payments are distributed under the TFES needs to be reformed. The existing system is outdated, inefficient, and modernization is long overdue. Payment should be made in a way that ensures businesses receive the support they need as quickly and cost effectively as possible. In its current form, the scheme often leaves businesses waiting far too long for reimbursements, creating cash flow issues and financial uncertainty. 

The scheme is currently linked to 20 foot containers as a standard measure of unit, known as TEU 20 foot equivalent unit. To be included in air freight, this linkage must be removed. The scheme needs to be more flexible to meet the demands of an economy that is changing.

In 2014, the Productivity Commission reviewed the TFES and recommended the scheme introduce payment of freight assistance as a flat rate per TEU and separate dollar amounts for the Tasmanian mainland, King Island, and the Furneaux Group following a public consultation process. In Hobart, the recent committee heard that from Ms Sheralee Davies of Wine Tasmania, who highlighted a key issue. Her research showed that 40 per cent of Tasmanian wine businesses are not utilising the TFES. The reason, she stated, was the rebate in smaller shipments is too insignificant to justify the effort, and the claims process itself is simply too complex.

In addition, it was recommended to me recently to exclude unprocessed timber logs on trucks and in containers. By removing this provision, we can promote on island opportunities for manufacturing and encourage more circular economy principles. We collect the resource, we process the resource, we turn it into beautiful things, we sell the final product on the island or as a high quality product off the island. A complete win-win for Tasmania. By creating efficiencies and streamlining processes to make things faster and cheaper and ensuring businesses receive their entitlements in a timely manner, we can provide greater stability and confidence for those who rely on the TFES. 

The committee Chair's recommendations are practical, common sense reforms that will improve efficiency, reduce costs and strengthen Tasmania's economic position. That is why this House must throw its support behind the recommendations and commit to lobbying both federal Labor and the Coalition to implement these vital changes. I am pleased both sides have made positive announcements in this space, but I believe we can keep the pressure on. Without meaningful reform, we will see continued barriers to growth, fewer opportunities for Tasmanian businesses, and an ongoing struggle to compete in national and global markets.

I urge my colleagues in this House to support this through championing the scheme with our federal colleagues and ensuring promises made throughout the current election campaign are followed through on.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=7.0_D=29.5_C=0.77] Alongside these TFES reforms, we must also address border issues in Tasmania's freight and shipping landscape. The formal recommendations of the Senate Committee highlight the need for careful consideration of TasPorts' role in our state's shipping operations. Concerns were raised about the efficiency and effectiveness of TasPorts' administration, particularly in facilitating competitive trade between Tasmania and the mainland, as well as its service delivery through Bass Island Line, one of the three regular freight services to the Bass Strait.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=38.4_D=20.3_C=0.71] At a Hobart hearing, TasPorts' Chief Executive Officer, Mr Anthony Donald, explained that federal competition laws restrict the ability to reduce intermodal costs, particularly wharfage fees. He noted that TasPorts competes with only two other entities transporting goods directly to Victoria, and that wharfage fees reflect the genuine cost of maintaining port infrastructure.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=59.8_D=7.2_C=0.84] At the King Island hearing, Mr Roger Clemens, representing both the farmers and the King Island Beef Producers Group, described the challenges faced by local producers. He argued that TasPorts operates with monopoly-like control, leaving businesses [Bookmark: Phr5_O=68.5_D=24.1_C=0.76]  with little power to influence freight services. He recalled a period during the recent drought when extra sailings from Devonport were urgently needed. Despite the demand, TasPorts initially claimed there was no freight, even though 55 trailers were waiting to be shipped with essential supplies.  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=93.4_D=3.8_C=0.71] It was only after ministerial intervention that the necessary services were provided.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=98.4_D=24.6_C=0.80] In response to these concerns, the committee has recommended that the ongoing review of Government Business Enterprises closely examines TasPorts' primary role in ensuring the most efficient and cost effective facilitation of trade. Additionally, the review should assess the impact of TasPorts operating as a shipping provider, particularly in light of the National Competition Policy and the additional cost this structure imposes.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=123.6_D=7.9_C=0.72] TasPorts is an essential part of our supply chain and its operations have a direct impact on cost efficiency and economic competitiveness. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=132.1_D=24.4_C=0.83]  It is imperative that any changes made to its governance and structure reflect the best interests of Tasmanian businesses and consumers alike. We must ensure that TasPorts is operating in a way that maximises efficiency and minimises costs. This is why I am also calling on the committee investigating GBE reforms and potential sales to formally consider recommendation 2 from the Senate committee report as part of its work.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=157.3_D=29.7_C=0.82] Any review of GBEs must prioritise affordability, transparency and fairness for those who depend on these services every day. We must ensure that TasPorts is held to the highest standards of accountability and that its primary function remains the facilitation of efficient, cost-effective trade for Tasmania.

This is not a partisan issue. It is about doing what is right for Tasmania. Freight costs impact every single Tasmanian, from our business owners and farmers to our consumers. We must modernise and strengthen the TFES so that it truly delivers for our state. If we do not take this opportunity to push for change, we risk seeing our businesses struggle under an unfair freight burden for years to come. This is about securing a stronger, more competitive future for Tasmania and ensuring that we are not left behind when the rest of the nation moves forward.
 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=208.9_D=20.7_C=0.74] I urge all members of this House to support this motion and work together to push for the reforms that will keep Tasmania competitive, connected and prosperous. This is our chance to deliver real, lasting benefits for our businesses, our workers and our economy. Let us stand together and ensure Tasmania's freight needs are met now and into the future.

[6.20 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=231.8_D=0.8_C=0.07]  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=234.9_D=9.6_C=0.75] Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) Honourable Speaker, I congratulate the member for Braddon for bringing this motion forward. She is, if you like, cooperating with another Jacqui Lambie Network member, namely Senator Tammy Tyrrell, who put forward what I considered to be a very good motion to the Senate for genuine hard work and looking after the interest of Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr15_O=246.2_D=18.6_C=0.77]  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=265.4_D=23.7_C=0.74] . For the member for Braddon, Mrs Beswick, to back that in as she has, is indicative of, if I might say, two likeminded individuals willing and wanting to do the very best for Tasmania and the many workers who rely on the freight scheme for their jobs.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=290.4_D=0.1_C=0.58]  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=291.6_D=13.3_C=0.77] I stand here as a Liberal who is very pleased to say that the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme was initially introduced by the Fraser government. It was a 1975 election promise and it delivered and commenced in 1977. Then the Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme, which was an extension of it, which is backed in now, the TT-Line ferries, was introduced by Mr Howard as a promise by the then Liberal opposition if elected in [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=29.1_C=0.78]  1996. If I recall correctly, it was delivered in September of 1996. I was pleased to be part of the government that introduced that. Then I was pleased to be part of the cabinet of Tony Abbott, also a Liberal Prime Minister, who extended the freight equalisation scheme to exports. You have a wonderful track record of Liberal prime ministers and Liberal governments delivering for the people of Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.8_D=29.3_C=0.82]  in an area, namely Bass Strait, which seems to be the most expensive stretch of water in the world to get product across. We can have a good discussion as to the reason for that, and it might be workplace relations, but I will avoid that topic for the purposes of this evening.

I congratulate Mrs Beswick for bringing this motion here and for Senator Tammy Tyrrell [Bookmark: Phr4_O=90.3_D=7.9_C=0.89]  for her productive Senate hearing. I was pleased to be able to appear before [Bookmark: Phr5_O=100.0_D=28.0_C=0.66]  that Senator's committee - albeit I was somewhat displeased that I was appearing, because she took my seat. If she had not have been elected, I would have been, but such is life. Senator Tyrrell did a wonderful job and it was a privilege to appear before the committee and then see the outcomes.

What I am also pleased about, having referred to three Liberal prime ministers who have done a great job in this area [Bookmark: Phr6_O=128.6_D=9.9_C=0.87] , I have every confidence that a fourth Liberal prime minister, soon to be Peter Dutton, will do exactly the same. He has announced [Bookmark: Phr7_O=140.4_D=21.6_C=0.77]  that the Liberal government, should he be elected, will invest $65 million in the scheme over one year, $3 million towards a review and $62 million in an uplift, or a 22 per cent increase and a $100 increase on intermodal transport, effectively [Bookmark: Phr8_O=162.4_D=29.9_C=0.64]  being a 33 per cent increase. Labor has tried to gazump that by saying they have a $95 million scheme. Let us not be fooled; that is over two years and is a 25 per cent increase. 

Why has Mr Dutton said a review? It was because that was the very first recommendation of Senator Tyrrell's motion, that 'The Australian government undertakes a review of the scheme [Bookmark: Phr9_O=192.6_D=25.7_C=0.79]  with consideration given to a number of factors.' Mr Dutton has committed he and his incoming government will have that review. Whilst that review takes place, which one assumes might take about 12 months, he has backed in the scheme with $62 million extra support which will help underpin the many jobs [Bookmark: Phr10_O=218.8_D=4.2_C=0.76]  in Tasmania. We know that there are many [Bookmark: Phr11_O=225.6_D=11.7_C=0.78]  employers in our state who are doing it tough at the moment because of world markets, et cetera. To be able to get their product across Bass Strait for export [Bookmark: Phr12_O=238.4_D=28.2_C=0.83]  is fundamentally important to them.

In relation to whole logs being sent over to the mainland, I have heard this being mentioned from time to time, and I was quizzed at the Senate hearing by a particular Greens senator who made certain accusations, which I was able to answer as being false and incorrect. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=267.7_D=29.1_C=0.76]  Sustainable Timbers Tasmania, from our public land, does not sell any logs interstate. Once they sell logs to particular sawmillers or processors, it is up to them to determine, then, because it is their private property, what they do with those logs. I am informed that the vast bulk of the logs that do go across Bass Strait are in fact from [Bookmark: Phr14_O=298.2_D=4.6_C=0.88]  private forest holdings. Therefore, if you believe [Bookmark: Phr15_O=303.8_D=1.2_C=0.62]  - and it is one of these conflicts. Do I want every single bit of wood grown in Tasmania to be processed in Tasmania? You bet I do. However, I also believe in the right of private property. If somebody owns a tree and, subject to our Forest Practices Authority, is entitled to harvest that tree according to our strict environmental standards, then it is appropriate for that person or entity to be able to sell that product to whomever they like. That said, I encourage every tree producer in Tasmania to do whatever they can to ensure that it can be value-added in Tasmania.

The Freight Equalisation Scheme is absolutely vital as 99 per cent of the goods imported and exported from our state come across Bass Strait. That is basically everything. This underpinning of our economy and jobs, and reducing the cost of living is fundamentally important and is something the Liberal Party has championed since 1975 and sought to enhance as time goes by. I am delighted that Mr Dutton has committed to that review and, during the review, providing $62 million of extra funding. 

I cannot help but think that Mr Dutton's commitment to that is not only his natural instinct of supporting Tasmania, but would have been backed by Mal Hingston for Braddon, Bridget Archer, the member for Bass, Susie Bower for Lyons, Josh Garvin for Franklin, and Marilena di Florio for Clark, as part of the Liberal team of candidates he is championing, and we on this side are championing, for the people of Tasmania to get the best possible result. Let us not forget our wonderful Liberal senate team headed by Senator Claire Chandler. 

The scheme materially boosts Tasmania's gross state product and employment, particularly in many industries located regionally around our state, including paper products, aquaculture and some of our mining activities. Exports of our physical goods to the Australian mainland and overseas are estimated to comprise typically between a third and 40 per cent of Tasmania's gross state product. That is a huge figure in anybody's language, and that is why then prime minister Malcolm Fraser showed foresight in introducing this scheme and it being enhanced so often under the Liberals when they have been in government. 

Congratulations to Mrs Beswick on this initiative; congratulations to Senator Tyrrell; and congratulations to Mr Dutton for accepting the Senate committee's findings and being willing to undertake a review. That is what responsible governments ought to do, rather than just saying, 'You have offered $65 million. We will gazump that by $95 million for the quick headline.' That is actually less than Mr Dutton is offering. It was $62 million in one year compared to Labor's $95 million over two years. 

However, the important thing of Mr Dutton's promise is the $3 million to be devoted to a full review, exactly as Senator Tyrrell's report recommends. He is taking the hard work of that committee seriously and wants to ensure that he and the government know exactly what needs to be done to underpin the freight scheme and ensure the future wellbeing of Tasmania's employment opportunities; the jobs of many men and women around Tasmania. That is especially in our regional productive areas that rely so heavily on a proper freight scheme that gives us the capacity to compete on an equal footing with our mainland counterparts. I have a great delight to have been able to participate in the debate initiated by Mrs Beswick, the member for Braddon.

[6.32 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I thank Mrs Beswick for bringing this motion to the House. It sounds like we are in furious agreement that the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme (TFES) is very important to Tasmania.

While the Greens support an increase in the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme, this should not be an excuse to plunder our native forests. I beg to differ with the minister: the export of whole logs from Tasmanian native forest to mills in Victoria is scandalous and yet another subsidy for a mendicant industry. Between 2019 and 2023, the federal government provided more than $20 million in subsidies to forestry contractors for exporting native forest and plantation logs through the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme. Things changed in 2023 when there was a sharp increase in the money subsidising transport of native forest products. Federal subsidies for transporting native forest products between Tasmania and Victoria doubled, with the federal government supplying upwards of $10 million in subsidies to a declining native forest industry in 2024. This is evident at the Devonport wharf where log trucks line up to be transported to the mainland carrying logs from Tasmania's native forests for processing.

It is particularly egregious to be taking up precious space on the Spirits of Tasmania with multiple logging trucks a day at a time when tourists are being turned away. That erodes the Tasmanian economy, especially the tourism economy, especially up in the north-west.

There is also the double dipping. Some of the companies that receive subsidies under the TFES also receive substantial Commonwealth and state funding under the Tasmania Forest Agreement exit packages. Private companies such as Western Junction Sawmill have received as much as $5 million a year from the taxpayer. Almost 70 per cent of Australians do not support native forest logging, and do not want to see the ongoing destruction of Tasmania's forests, and yet their tax dollars are being spent subsidising this unprofitable and unsustainable industry. There are concerns that the use of the TFES this way is undermining Victoria's transition away from native forest logging and that native Tasmanian timbers are being milled and sold from Victorian mills.

I will draw on the same inquiry that Senator Tyrrell held in Hobart on 13 November last year and point out the Australian Greens position in that:

The Australian Greens recommend that there is a statutory review of the threshold levels and payment cap under the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme, to be conducted every three years to ensure consideration of an alignment with changes in sea and road freight costs. The Greens recognise the importance and equity of the TFES to Tasmania's economy, including its many small and agricultural businesses. 

Again, we are in furious agreement. The only exception is the recommendations of the report in regard to how wood products and woodchips, or particles, are considered under the TFES, in particular the eligibility of sawlogs and other products sourced from Tasmania's native forests.

A number of environmental non-government organisations appeared before that inquiry. That included the Wilderness Society, the Bob Brown Foundation and Environmental Justice Australia (EJA). Environmental Justice Australia stated their concerns in relation to the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme - that it was limited to its application to the timber industry and subsidisation of native forest wood to the extent it is shipped from Tasmanian forests to mainland Australia. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.6_D=5.7_C=0.85]  This is a concern shared by the Greens and particularly the Greens [Bookmark: Phr3_O=38.1_D=0.7_C=0.54]  senator Nick McKim. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=40.0_D=29.7_C=0.84]  At the hearing, the EJA further submitted that:

The Australian Government has committed to halting and reversing deforestation, forest degradation and biodiversity loss in Australia by 2030. We consider that this review is an opportunity for the federal government to ensure that the scheme aligns with the government's broader commitments, policies and international obligations [Bookmark: Phr5_O=70.2_D=29.5_C=0.70] , including its no new extinctions policy -

A very interesting policy, that.

- and discontinue its subsidisation of the native forest logging industry.

These broader commitments, policies and obligations include the Convention of the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals of 1979, the Montreal Process for the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Temperate [Bookmark: Phr6_O=99.8_D=30.0_C=0.74]  and Boreal Forests 1994, and Australia's renewed commitment at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) to halt and reverse forest lost by 2030 and to prevent further extinctions as part of the Glasgow Leaders Declaration on Forests and Land Use. As submitted by the EJA, Tasmania's native forests are:

… critical habitat for iconic threatened wildlife, including the swift [Bookmark: Phr7_O=129.9_D=7.7_C=0.84]  parrot and Tasmanian devil, both of which are facing extinction if more is not done now to ensure their survival.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=140.9_D=26.8_C=0.76] I would like to end my contribution on this matter with a statement provided to the Senate TFES Inquiry from Tasmanian Aboriginal Elder Uncle Jimmy Everett/Puralia Meenamatta, who said:

First Nations' law is in Country, and we are obligated to defend our law because we are Country and Country is us. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=168.1_D=27.8_C=0.83]  The profit-driven, and huge taxpayer costs to maintain the forest industry, and the costs in terms of destroying natural ecosystems and the life therein, is a serious issue at this time of climate change, and it has to stop immediately. As Aboriginal people, we have a saying, 'We are Country and Country is us'. We are obligated to protect these forests.

Finally, the TFES is very important to Tasmania but so too is our natural heritage. We should be protecting that and not squandering it.

Recognition of Visitors

DEPUTY SPEAKER - As Ms Dow is making her way to the despatch box, I acknowledge in the gallery Ms Haddad's mum, Anne, and her visiting cousins from Melbourne: David, Nithia, and Arlo. Welcome to the parliament.

Members - Hear, hear.
———————————————————
[6.40 p.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Deputy Speaker, I rise tonight to speak on Mrs Beswick's notice of motion, and I can indicate to the House that we will be supporting this motion. I thank you very much for bringing it forward for the consideration of the parliament.  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=241.8_D=23.9_C=0.83] The motion itself is pretty straightforward, in my mind. Of course this House would recognise the value of the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme to the economic prosperity of Tasmania and in particular the Bass Strait Islands, and its role in supporting comparable shipping costs with mainland Australia. That goes without saying.

We note [Bookmark: Phr15_O=266.0_D=7.5_C=0.69]  the Senate select committee's recommendations and also the information that is in point (2)(a) and (b) of the motion. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=274.8_D=0.8_C=0.85]  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=276.8_D=14.3_C=0.79]  We also would have reviewed the reforms and additional recommendations as part of that process. We are happy to agree to point (3) as well, and also happy to continue speaking to our federal colleagues about that. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=292.0_D=12.9_C=0.73]  Further, we have no issue with point (4) and that being incorporated in the review of government business enterprises and this government's plan to privatise those. It would be essential to look at those things.

I note that in the inquiry report there is a reference made to the fact that not all of the aspects of the report and its recommendations lay responsibility at the foot of the federal government; there does need to be a working relationship with state governments and local government as well.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.6_D=4.0_C=0.36] In her contribution, Mrs Beswick made reference to King Island shipping  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.1_D=29.8_C=0.83] and the King Island community, and the representations that they made throughout this process. I want to put on the record that these will not be the first representations that our King Island community will have made to this state government or the federal government around the high cost of shipping to the island and the pressure that that puts on people who live on that island. It adds to the cost of living, and shipping is their economic and community lifeline, as it is for all of our ports across the state. 

Some of the feedback from the King Island community should have come as no surprise to the state government. They have a responsibility around the shipping service to King Island that is provided by TasPorts. There needs to be additional work done at a state level around the King Island shipping services.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=85.4_D=9.6_C=0.69] I want to talk a little bit about the fact that we are an island state and we rely heavily on shipping. I make note of minister Abetz's reference to  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=95.5_D=27.3_C=0.83] industrial agreements and costs. I want to put on the record our support for all the workers who work in our maritime industries across the state. In fact, if they were not working on these shipping services, providing these valuable services, we would not be able to get goods to market and we would not have ships working and sailing across Bass Strait. I put on the record my support for them and of course those representatives from the Maritime Union of Australia.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=124.1_D=24.1_C=0.81] I think it is really interesting that at a time when this government is considering privatising port assets across the state - and let us be clear, you have not ruled that out; you have said that everything is on the table - government members would come in here and talk about the importance of freight costs and that being equitable to Tasmanians, and the importance of freight services to the Tasmanian economy. We all know what happens when  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=148.6_D=5.7_C=0.68] ports are privatised. We have seen what happened in New South Wales; we have seen what happened in Darwin and yet [Bookmark: Phr9_O=154.7_D=12.0_C=0.83]  you still come in here and make those comments on the record whilst still being open to privatising Tasmania's ports. I think that is pretty poor form.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=168.4_D=15.6_C=0.82] The other point that I want to make is about our federal Labor colleagues' commitment to the Freight Equalisation Scheme and increased funding for the Freight Equalisation Scheme over a two-year period. They too have agreed to a review of that, which was what was recommended as part of the Senate inquiry.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=184.9_D=21.2_C=0.82] I acknowledge the work of Senator Anne Urquhart, who was the deputy chair of that Senate committee and I know put a lot of work and effort in. She worked very closely with Senator Tammy Tyrrell on that report, its recommendations and the good work that that committee conducted across our state.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=207.8_D=7.6_C=0.73] I would like to clarify - minister Abetz made reference to what he felt were some inadequacies in federal Labor's commitment  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=215.8_D=20.0_C=0.81] of $95 million over two years. I wonder whether the Coalition's commitment extends to the Bass Strait Islands, because that is not clear. If there are some subsequent speakers from the other side of the House, I would appreciate that being made clear during their contribution.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=238.8_D=27.6_C=0.88] Right across Tasmania we have world-class producers, world-class small to medium agricultural enterprises that punch above their weight and deserve to have equitable freight cost access across Bass Strait. They deserve equitable access to interstate markets. They do not have the advantage of our mainland counterparts, who have access to  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=267.3_D=4.2_C=0.81] trucking and rail infrastructure to get their products to market.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=272.7_D=23.8_C=0.81] We on this side of the House are incredibly proud of our producers across Tasmania and what they do, and the-world class produce that they produce. I put on the record my utmost praise for them and the work that they do, and to acknowledge again the fact that the Freight Equalisation Scheme underpins our economy. It creates jobs,  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=297.3_D=5.0_C=0.80] it generates economic activity, and it makes it easier to do business in Tasmania  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=302.8_D=1.5_C=0.83] with mainland counterparts.

The last point that I want to put on the record is to remind this government, again, about the freight service of the Spirit of Tasmania, and how bitterly disappointed we are on this side of the House that we do not have Spirit IV in service and we do not have that increased capacity in freight. For those primary producers who are geared up for that, who had looked to new markets, that had increased their yields to get their products to market on the mainland; they have been let down by this government. There were issues around freight and service, with one of the major freight shipping companies being out of service over the summer. That did put incredible pressure, particularly on fresh produce, in getting that to the interstate markets.

I want to leave that with the government. There is still more work for you to do. You have let down our primary producers when it comes to the Spirit of Tasmania vessels and that increased capacity and economic activity.

We support Mrs Beswick's motion tonight. It is important. We are following the Senate recommendations with great interest. We thank and praise our federal Labor colleagues for their commitment during the federal election campaign, and Senator Anne Urquhart for her work during the Senate deliberations. Once again, I say that we will be supporting the motion.

[6.48 p.m.]
Mr WOOD (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak on Mrs Beswick's motion tonight, and thank her for bringing it forward. I would like to also mention, before I kick things off, that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that Labor supports the TFES, and it goes without saying. Well, you have not been very quiet of late about it, but it is great you are finally on board with it.

Ms Finlay - 'We have not been very quiet', no, that is right. We are strong advocates of things all the time.

Mr WOOD - The Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme is critical to Tasmanian businesses, jobs, economy, and the cost of living for all Tasmanians. As an island state, we rely heavily on sea freight to both sell our goods to markets on mainland Australia and internationally, and to bring goods to the Tasmanian market that we would otherwise not have access to.

Key industry groups - the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Fruit Growers Tasmania - have highlighted the need for immediate changes to the Commonwealth scheme ahead of a full review. Costs have increased significantly in recent years and payments under the TFES have failed to keep up. The Tasmanian Government made these issues abundantly clear to the Senate select committee inquiry, reinforcing that any changes to the TFES must ensure Tasmanian businesses should be no worse off.

Implemented in 1976, the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme provides Tasmanian businesses with a more equal footing to compete in mainland markets. It recognises that sea transport across Bass Strait poses costs to businesses in excess of the cost of transporting goods the equivalent distance by road or rail. We welcome the Senate select committee's findings that the scheme is out of date and does not deliver on the original policy intent of equalising freight disadvantage incurred by our Tasmanian businesses. Moving goods across Bass Strait is still relatively expensive when compared to road and rail transport, due to the high fixed costs of shipping over relatively short distances. Several studies have demonstrated that these additional costs are both unavoidable and materially impact the competitiveness and profitability of Tasmanian businesses.

If the scheme were to be discontinued or reduced, it would have significant negative economic repercussions and would increase Tasmania's relative disadvantage compared to other states. Many Tasmanian businesses would experience multiple levels of disadvantage, including higher costs for inputs shipped into Tasmania used to make other final goods in major industries, such as manufacturing, mining, agriculture, forestry and fishing. Higher costs for shipping final goods to markets in Australia and internationally for sale, and generally, higher transport and shipping costs will have a negative impact on delivery of key infrastructure, and will impact the Tasmanian economy as a whole. This would have a direct impact on Tasmanian jobs and our cost of living.

Freight costs and services across Bass Strait are a key determinant of business profitability and competitiveness. Freight cost competitiveness is an important enabler for the entire Tasmanian economy. Past modelling exercises have demonstrated the broader benefits for Tasmania's economy deriving from the scheme. The scheme materially boosts Tasmania's gross state product and employment, particularly in many industries located regionally, including agriculture, forestry, wood and paper products, aquaculture, and some mining activities. Importantly, the scheme boosts output across nearly all of the Tasmanian economy, and not just among those industries that are direct recipients of the payments. This is compared to the marginal impact on the national economy in meeting the cost of the scheme. Furthermore, the scheme allows for a diversity of goods and services that Tasmania contributes to the national market and allows mainland businesses to serve the Tasmanian market more easily.

Despite the longstanding existence of the scheme, it has not acted as a disincentive to reduce freight costs in all other aspects. The Tasmanian government and transport businesses have worked to improve freight transport and efficiencies within the state. For example, shortly after the Australian government reaffirmed its support for the scheme and announced an expansion in 2015, the Tasmanian government released its Integrated Freight Strategy, which, among other things, targeted improved efficiency, cost effectiveness, capacity, customer choice, responsiveness, competitiveness, safety, and reliability in the freight sector. Similarly, under the scheme, Tasmanian businesses have a strong incentive to innovate, to improve their efficiency, and to compete with their mainland counterparts. While the scheme seeks to reduce shipping disadvantages incurred by Tasmanian businesses, it does not create any competitive advantage over other Australian businesses. The scheme cannot compensate for the travel time disadvantage of shipping compared to road and rail or freight or the logistical constraints imposed by Bass Strait.

The Tasmanian government is committed to the ongoing pursuit of landside supply chain efficiencies. However, these efforts will have a very limited impact on the relative cost of Bass Strait shipping compared to land transport. It is reasonable to expect that Bass Strait shipping costs will remain the largest component of the overall freight transport costs for businesses.

Assistance to offset sea transport cost disadvantage therefore plays a substantial and ongoing role in helping Tasmanian industries remain competitive. Unfortunately, many of the cost drivers for Bass Strait shipping cannot be easily influenced by Tasmanian businesses or by the Tasmanian government. Input costs, such as labour and fuel costs, in addition to other costs such as port licence fees and pass-throughs from Victoria are all outside of Tasmania's control. Nonetheless, we are committed to a strategic approach in partnership with industry to drive improvements in the efficiency of Tasmania's freight supply chains.

The Tasmanian government supports changes to the scheme that can be shown to improve efficiency and simplicity for claimants, reduce overall administrative costs, and improve confidence in integrity and transparency of this very important scheme, on the basis that any such changes will underpin the ongoing sustainability of the scheme. Our submission to the inquiry proposed that consideration should be given to reducing the administrative cost of the scheme to both claimants and the Australian government by simplifying arrangements for any claim below a threshold level and for less than full container loads. We have heard from some in the industry that the scheme is challenging to participate in. In particular, the barriers to entry into the scheme and the cost of complying with its requirements are larger for smaller businesses and those not regularly moving goods in large quantities. We certainly support the committee's findings to make administrative and accessibility improvements to the scheme.

Like the main island of Tasmania, the Bass Strait islands are reliant on sea freight for almost all of their basic needs. Reliable and affordable services are essential to meeting the freight task, which is a combination of general freight, refrigerated freight, hazardous goods and livestock. 

Bass Strait islands have limited access to shipping options that provide a direct service between the islands and mainland Australia. The majority of freight movements between the islands and mainland Australia must transit through a port on the main island of Tasmania, thus resulting in two freight legs. This is more expensive and has implications for assistance available under the scheme. It also highlights the difference in assistance available for shippers on King Island compared to those in the Furneaux Group.

The scheme provides extra assistance for eligible northbound freight shipped from the Furneaux Group to the mainland via the main island of Tasmania. This is most welcome. It recognises the additional disadvantage of needing to employ two shipping legs and increases the maximum assistance payable to $1710 per 20-foot equivalent unit (TEU), compared to a maximum of $855 for the King Island shippers. The scheme also provides additional flat rate assistance to the Furneaux Group in relation to goods imported or exported to international markets, which is not available to King Island shippers.

An extension to the scheme to provide additional assistance to King Island is an opportunity to alleviate cost pressures for the King Island community. The additional assistance could mirror that available to Furneaux Group shippers to promote consistency in the application of the scheme on all the Bass Strait islands. The extra assistance available to Furneaux Group shippers for northbound domestic freight could also be extended to apply to southbound freight with two shipping legs, and expanded to apply to King Island shippers.

In June 2024, the Tasmanian government wrote to the federal minister for Transport, Catherine King, to request a permanent extension to the TFES to better align the assistance available for King Island and the Furneaux Group, and for a temporary increase in the assistance available for southbound feed and fodder to the main island of Tasmania. While this extension was, unfortunately, not supported, in July 2024 the Australian government introduced a 12-month temporary amendment to the TFES to include donated fodder transported to King Island. We will continue to advocate for the equitable treatment of King Island as part of the Australian government's review of the scheme. 

The government strongly supports the immediate increase in the scheme pending the full review. This is necessary to narrow the growing gulf between available rates of assistance and actual cost of delivering goods to Tasmania. Agri-businesses, producers and their representatives, like TasFarmers, have expressed their strong concerns to the government that the TFES assistance rates have not changed since 1998 and do not reflect the increase Bass Strait shipping costs. This is a de facto tax on Tasmanians. The Tasmanian Liberal government's position will always be that Tasmanian businesses should be no worse off under any changes to the scheme. 

Mrs BESWICK (Braddon) - Deputy Speaker, I thank the minister, Mr Abetz, Ms Burnet, Ms Dow and Mr Wood for their contributions this afternoon. I do not know if we needed a 10-minute Liberal promotional video, but thank you for supporting this motion, Mr Abetz.

Mr Abetz - Let me convince you.

Mrs BESWICK - I probably should not have opened a can of worms with the comments about logs but, thank you, Ms Burnet. It was a great segue to your contribution. Well done. The King Island cost of living and supporting of workers in the maritime industry are important factors so,  thank you, Ms Dow. I also thank Senators Tyrrell and Urquhart for the Senate committee and the work it produced. It was an important piece of work because we do deserve equitable freight access and this scheme is really out of date. I thank you all for your support on this motion. I am glad we have had a polite and friendly afternoon.

Motion agreed to.


WAIVER OF PRIVATE MEMBERS TIME

Mrs BESWICK - Deputy Speaker, I advise that I wish to waive the rest of my private members time.


MOTION

80:20 Co-Contribution Ratio for Regional Road and Bridge Projects

[7.02 p.m.]
Mr FERGUSON (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I will require a vote. I move -

That the House 

Notes that -

the Bass Highway is a strategically vital asset in Tasmania’s transport network for local residents and visitors and as a key freight route linking rail, ports and roads for the agriculture, forestry, aquaculture and mining industries; 

the Federal Government committed $80 million to the Bass Highway in the 2021-22 Australian Budget, calling it the Bass Highway Safety and Freight Efficiency Upgrades Package; 

the Federal Government reallocated this funding to other Southern Tasmanian road projects in the 2023-24 MYEFO, leaving the Bass highway package unfunded; 

the Tasmanian Liberal Government committed $20 million to the duplication of the Bass Highway from Launceston to Deloraine in the 2024 State Election; and 

the long-standing 80:20 co-contribution ratio for regional road and bridge projects between the Federal Government and State Government has been vital for Tasmania’s infrastructure program and has been removed from the Land Transport Infrastructure National Partnership Agreement. 

Calls on all political parties to, before 3 May 2025, commit to restoring the longstanding guaranteed 80:20 co-contribution ratio for future regional road and bridge projects.

It is important for our state to realise that between today and before 3 May, we should secure something akin to what we have just listened to in relation to the TFES. While the major parties are not completely aligned on the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme expansion - which I thoroughly welcome, I am very pleased about that - I hope this House will send a clear message with the same kind of bipartisanship on the importance of getting proper co-contribution ratios in federal and state land transport infrastructure dealings. This is our opportunity as a House. I believe it is within our capacity to do this. I have saved my politics for my contribution, not the motion itself. I have kept the motion very plain in relation to some key facts: how we got here and how we can get out of what I regard as an unacceptable situation going forward. I will be presenting to the House some important history, much of which is heavily drawn from my experience as minister for Infrastructure for more than five years.

I will not read out the Bass Highway motion. Thanks to the independent member for Clark, Ms Johnston, who pointed out to me the importance of including rail in this motion, I foreshadow that before I sit down I will also move a small amendment to do that.

When I was minister for Infrastructure, in August last year I received the final Federation Funding Agreement on land transport infrastructure for signing from the federal minister for Infrastructure, Catherine King. Ms King and I come from different party traditions but we did serve together in the House of Representatives in my time there, in the fourth term of the Howard government. I always enjoyed working with Catherine King. I have said that in this House and in media conferences. With occasional exceptions, we achieved a lot together and I appreciated being able to work with her. I generally speak well of the engagement between our governments.

When I received that final agreement - which was acceptable to our government to sign, it was the result of serious discussions, negotiations and disagreements between not just the Tasmanian and Australian governments in the negotiation of the words that should go into that agreement. Every state and territory had the same debate, even the big ones like New South Wales and Victoria, whose populations are predominantly in the capital cities where those inner metro areas have a longstanding co-contribution ratio of 50:50. Even those big states with big capital cities stood with the heavily regionalised states and territories like Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland because none of us were satisfied with the opening ambit - I should say, opening gambit - from the Australian government. They wanted to move everything to 50:50. It was quite outrageous when you think about it. I respect and understand that members of this House may not have some of that insight, but that is where they, as an Australian government policy, wanted to take it. It was something that was [Bookmark: Phr2_O=15.6_D=3.0_C=0.67]  a strong element of the infrastructure review, which I may come to. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=20.7_D=17.6_C=0.77]  

It was a great deal of work. A lot of credit can be taken by, I will say, all state and territory infrastructure ministers, including me. I take that credit. We worked very hard to press the point to Canberra. I want to tell the House that we were under incredible pressure. I will tell you why in a minute. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=39.2_D=24.3_C=0.77]  After a great deal of work as well by the treasurers and the treasuries and the various departments of state growth and their equivalents interstate, we had what I consider an important victory. 

I describe it as an important victory because we got an agreement that we were willing to sign. Colleagues might be wondering, 'Well, what was the breakthrough?' The breakthrough was that after months and months [Bookmark: Phr5_O=64.9_D=3.6_C=0.62]  of wrangling and meetings and various ministerial councils and the like [Bookmark: Phr6_O=71.3_D=1.3_C=0.94] , the Australian government [Bookmark: Phr7_O=73.3_D=0.6_C=0.65]  withdrew [Bookmark: Phr8_O=75.7_D=15.7_C=0.65]  the specific language of 50:50, which they had had in the agreement. Look at the bargaining position of the states and territories compared to the Australian government in this situation. Appreciate what you would have done in the same situation. It was hard for us to hold our ground.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=92.8_D=24.1_C=0.86] First of all, the Australian government is the key funding partner for major projects. I can think of plenty of projects that are funded in Tasmania that are 100 per cent state government. There are quite a number - I can think of them right now - but for the big, strategic projects, and any that relate to the major [Bookmark: Phr10_O=118.1_D=24.6_C=0.85]  corridors, whether it is road, bridge or rail, all states rely on the Australian government. It should not be lost on members that that is a result of the heavy taxation on fuel that pays for that infrastructure, by the way. Taxpayers are making that major contribution. 

The reason it was so hard to hold the line was because the agreement ran out last June. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=144.8_D=2.5_C=0.83]  The previous agreement that we were relying on [Bookmark: Phr12_O=147.9_D=1.6_C=0.88]  timed out on 30 June. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=152.6_D=7.9_C=0.86]  What was the implication of that? They were threatening to withhold future payments even on existing projects. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=163.7_D=25.9_C=0.86]  The Federation Funding Agreement (FFA) did not detail any funding split, but unfortunately - and I hope this is a remedy for us between now and 3 May - it failed to acknowledge the long-accepted 80:20 Commonwealth/state funding model that had been supported by many previous Australian governments. 

I have most of my experience with the Coalition [Bookmark: Phr15_O=190.4_D=2.1_C=0.61] . I accept that, but I had a conversation [Bookmark: Phr16_O=193.4_D=9.6_C=0.81]  with another MP, who may or may not wish me to name them - I will not - who made the same comment about previous Labor governments. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=203.8_D=3.9_C=0.81]  The 80:20 has worked well. It has worked well for Tasmania. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=208.8_D=19.7_C=0.86]  Without it, it would not have been possible for us to achieve the upgrades that we have. I want to make the point that it has worked well for our country. It is the point that I made at those ministerial councils, which I think helped to get that coalition of support amongst ministers and treasurers of completely different parties. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=229.9_D=5.6_C=0.82]  

However, the point that I make about removing the 80:20 from the agreement, even though we signed it [Bookmark: Phr20_O=240.3_D=1.2_C=0.95] , is that we need to do better [Bookmark: Phr21_O=242.6_D=12.0_C=0.88] , because, in other words, every Tasmanian road and bridge project would be subject to funding support on a case-by-case basis, based on perhaps the whims of that minister of the day [Bookmark: Phr22_O=256.1_D=4.4_C=0.86]  and other priorities that they might be considering, political and otherwise.

 [Bookmark: Phr23_O=262.4_D=24.6_C=0.84] I remember the day clearly. I welcomed - as I nearly always did when it came to working with the Australian government, even though it is a red colour - the federal Labor government's change of heart. It was a backdown on that original unacceptable approach of a 50:50 funding model for roads and bridges in Tasmania and rail [Bookmark: Phr24_O=287.8_D=7.9_C=0.78]  in the regions. 

I will make a quick comment here. It is understood and accepted that projects in metro areas can be 50:50 [Bookmark: Phr25_O=296.0_D=8.8_C=0.85] , but outside of those, 80:20. Can I do a quick moment of mathematics here as well to explain the importance of this? I honestly believe the Australian government made a miscalculation about what this could lead to. Perhaps that by  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=9.3_D=5.9_C=0.81] reducing the ratio to 50:50 they would get more infrastructure funded.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=17.0_D=25.0_C=0.76] 

That was and is a naive concept. States and territories are already heavily maxed out on their infrastructure capability. Speaking for our state, we have been very committed on infrastructure and have been spending a lot on it, even to the point that some economists, including Mr Eslake, have been saying, 'Dial down the state funding on infrastructure.' We have explained our position on that. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=42.9_D=16.6_C=0.82]  

If you start with the scenario I want to paint here, and you can extrapolate this out to an entire state's program, if we put forward $20 million and we say that represents the state's maximum capacity - we want to build as much infrastructure as we can - then under an 80:20 scenario we get an additional $80 million, we have $100 million. It makes perfect sense, and we get the job done. If you agree with my starting assertion that that is the state's maximum capability, that $20 million under a 50:50 scenario means we just get another $20 million. We end up with $40 million and we have totally met our capability. That is a missing $60 million. That is a 60 per cent reduction in the work that will be done in a state like Tasmania.  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=95.6_D=2.6_C=0.83] 

It is totally unacceptable to our side of politics.  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=99.0_D=28.5_C=0.84] I hope it is unacceptable to the House, and I can tell you, it was unacceptable to industry as well. They cheered us on, not just in Tassie with the CCF Tasmanian branch - and I commend Mr Andrew Winch for his advocacy here. It was tremendous. The same can be said across the country, including in red states. 

I do not want to embarrass Ms Lawler, but I enjoyed working with Eva Lawler, the former chief minister of the Northern Territory. She lost office in August of last year and  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=129.0_D=18.2_C=0.82] I know she was under a lot of pressure to sign the 50:50 deal. She might have, in the lead up to her election, which she was unfortunately unable to win for her side of politics, but she held the line when there was a moment of political opportunity to say, 'Look at the great deal we have signed with Canberra.' I commended her at the time for holding the line, knowing what I knew [Bookmark: Phr10_O=149.8_D=5.4_C=0.87]  about the pressure she was under, of course mindful that projects were actually being built at that time the  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=156.5_D=6.3_C=0.89] Commonwealth were threatening to withhold milestone payments, which is [Bookmark: Phr12_O=164.6_D=14.8_C=0.77]  a terrible way to treat a state or territory. We fought that battle. 

I make the point that this includes the project that the motion begins with, the Bass Highway [Bookmark: Phr13_O=180.6_D=15.2_C=0.84] . That is an important project for us, so is the Midland Highway, the Tasman Highway, the Bridgewater bridge, and many other projects which have only been possible because of that Australian government contribution by parties of both colours in our time here.  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=196.8_D=4.8_C=0.80] That is consistent with that level of government's greater financial capacity.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=203.3_D=9.6_C=0.92] I think that it was a shameful period in federal-state relations. The media just got a taste of it, but behind the scenes there was a lot of work by a lot of good people.  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=214.7_D=17.4_C=0.78] I think of, for example, the Victorian government: Jacinta Allan, who was infrastructure minister, and Tim Pallas, the former treasurer. They held the line as well as Tasmania did, even though they were in the same party. That is the way it had to be fought, because without that important outcome  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=232.6_D=13.8_C=0.76] we would today be looking at a scenario that when we are looking at the next big project - let us say the Tamar bridge, which I am passionately in support of - we would have signed a document that said, 'We will only ever ask you for half.'

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=248.3_D=7.3_C=0.83] How do we get back to where we were? That is the question that I propose today. I am very pleased that  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=257.4_D=4.8_C=0.67] we were able to at least remove the 50:50 from the document itself, but  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=264.1_D=4.4_C=0.80] half of the puzzle has now been solved. That is [Bookmark: Phr21_O=269.4_D=23.4_C=0.82]  because Peter Dutton, the alternative prime minister, and Senator Bridget McKenzie, the shadow minister - I visited Bridget in February to advocate on this very issue in Canberra to reinstate and to make a commitment around 80:20 - have made that commitment in the run up to the 3 May election. [Bookmark: Phr22_O=293.6_D=11.4_C=0.87]  I hope that that sends a really clear message that that was the ideal model, and it is the best way to keep major infrastructure in Australia being built, and not only deliver the better safety and productivity improvements, but also keep a lot of great men and women in work in an exciting industry.

I want to praise Mr Dutton and Senator McKenzie for that announcement - strongly advocated, by the way, by my good friend Susie Bower, the Liberal candidate in the seat of Lyons. She is a tremendous person. She was immediately advocating for this, and has been widely praised for her advocacy as well as her communication of the policy announcement. Of course, I speak well of all of our Liberal candidates, but my intention just now is to specifically mention Susie Bower.

That is the outcome that we need. It is half of the puzzle; we do not know who will win the 3 May election. I hope the Peter Dutton-led coalition wins the election and gets Australia back on track. My word, we have lost lot of ground in the last three years. Three years ago, Australians were told 'It won't be easy under Albanese.' It turned out to be exactly right. It has been very tough on Australians, with a government that has really taken its eye off the real goals of government. You ask yourself: what have they achieved in three years? I will leave the question to your own good selves.

The other side of the coin is if we can encourage other parties who are contesting the election, in particular the incumbent government, the Labor Party - I again make the point, I have saved my politics for my speech, not the motion. The motion reminds all political parties of the importance of restoring the longstanding guaranteed 80:20 co-contribution ratio for future regional road and bridge projects. That is where I want to get us to. I hope I have made the arguments adequately to the task.

By the way, if anybody is thinking that there are votes in this, you got it right. There are votes in this for the Labor Party to get up to speed on this. I speak here of the federal Labor Party, not the state Labor Party. If we can get the federal level to enjoin this policy, or even do better than 80 per cent, go for it.

I want to continue to make the point that the Bass Highway is, for me, one of the best examples of why we need to see a real and genuine and enduring partnership between our levels of government. I was extremely proud and pleased that in the federal Budget 2021-22, we got that $80 million for the Bass Highway. We got it. By the way, at that point in time, we had not finished but we were doing the Bass Highway corridor study - Launceston through Devonport. I commend that document to members, by the way. It has a well-researched and publicly consulted plan for decades to come about what the immediate, short-term, medium-term and then long-term objectives are for that important asset.

It has been said by many that the Bass Highway is the backbone for freight in Tasmania. The Midland Highway serves an incredible role. All of the highways do - that is why they are highways. However, the Bass Highway critically links two major ports with the rest of the state. It is an important asset in terms of freight reliability, to say little about the importance of the road for the people who live in our communities in the north-west and north of Tasmania, and also the tourism industry and people who just want to get about and move around our beautiful state.

The Bass Highway funding was withdrawn. Today, I am still not sure how it happened. It was actually a matter of disagreement between our governments. I believe that even for a period, it may be said that the Australian government had not done it deliberately, but it did happen. That funding was withdrawn.

I felt quite tricked on this, because after that federal budget, last year, I welcomed the Australian government's allocation of funding to the Lyell Highway. I thought it was terrific. It really matched up beautifully with the commitments we made in the state election to upgrade the Lyell Highway - a major upgrade. I was horrified. Apparently, it takes a little time for the departments to crunch the numbers and understand what happened. It was explained to me that the funding had been reallocated from the Bass Highway. We had been fooled into thinking it was a new commitment. It would actually just have been money shifted around. We had been told hundreds of millions of dollars come in to Tasmania. I welcomed that, as a responsible state minister should when the Australian government is pouring money into the state. It turned out that in net terms we were only about $20 million better off, and we had lost the money for the Bass Highway. Appalling. Gavin Pearce went berserk over this. It was a terrible outcome for his community. Let us not forget that the Bass Highway runs through my electorate of Bass as well as Lyons. It was a big blow for the North, and I think many people were shocked and disappointed.

This motion really is not about the Bass Highway getting that funding committed by the coalition, but I welcome the fact that that has happened. I dare to say I hope and I am optimistic that the Labor Party will want to match that as well.

This motion today is really about the future of funding arrangements that our small state absolutely depends upon. We absolutely depend upon it. If you want to see a Tamar bridge built, it needs to be under an 80:20 formula. It has to. If you want to see a major upgrade in your electorate, if you want to see an improvement that responds to some growth in a population centre, for it to be effective for our state to drive our dollar as far as it can possibly go, we need to see that co-contribution rate returned.

I actually believe we will get there, by the way, but the opportunity is not after 3 May. The opportunity is before 3 May. That is why I have listed this motion for debate. I want to see everybody vote for it and support it. That is why I have been careful, so nobody could claim this is a wedge motion. I have saved my political narrative for my contribution.

Before I sit down, I will just move that amendment to include rail. I move -

In paragraph (2),

Following 'bridge projects'

Insert 'and to cement this funding ratio for the Tasmanian freight rail network'

I will only speak to that briefly. I have circulated the amendment. I trust it is welcomed by members around the House. I credit Ms Johnston, the member for Clark for bringing that to my notice. It was an oversight and I am appreciative of that. The amended motion, if we agree to that, would now include reference to our Tasmanian freight rail network and the jointly-funded contributions to our rail track and infrastructure.

I want to quickly say that the Australian government, both the Coalition and the current Labor government, have been faithful to their word on rail funding. It actually was 50:50 for the first, I think, two tranches. In the most recent tranche, we were able to get a Coalition commitment of 80:20 for the additional tranche. That is the one that we are working on right now and that Mr Vincent and his team are overseeing. The Australian Labor government have honoured that. I want to see that continue as well. I am sure we all do.

With that, I will pause and I commit the amendment. I certainly commend the amended motion to the House.

[7.25 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I thank Mr Ferguson for the motion. The amendment is sensible. To look at increasing that funding contribution to rail and ultimately get more freight and so forth off the roads would be the best alternative.

This is a really timely debate, partly because some of the crossbench attended a briefing from the Road Safety Advisory Council today. There was discussion around various upgrades and safety as the key component in looking at those upgrades and so forth, for roads and for the safety of all road users. That is one of the key issues for the Greens.

Having funding to contribute and asking for that re-establishment of the 80:20 split is a good thing for Tasmania. While the topic of this debate is about the Bass Highway, it is nice to figuratively travel up to the north-west [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.1_D=24.4_C=0.78]  and consider the Bass Highway as one of the key roads in Tasmania. I did travel at the same time as minister Abetz for that trip to Leith -

Mr Abetz - Leith Tasmania, not Scotland.

Ms BURNET - Not Scotland - the Leith turnoff. Out of that I would hope to think that [Bookmark: Phr3_O=55.5_D=4.0_C=0.88]  some of the concerns about road safety were addressed [Bookmark: Phr4_O=60.1_D=12.1_C=0.85]  by a simple change, not an expensive infrastructure change. It is an inexpensive way of looking at some of those issues such as [Bookmark: Phr5_O=74.3_D=6.7_C=0.84]  concerns about road safety at a turnoff such as Leith. This road safety mechanism was to reduce the speed limit along that highway so that people [Bookmark: Phr7_O=91.2_D=17.2_C=0.79]  turning right and heading east would be less likely to be travelling at a 100 kilometre per hour speed to merge with other traffic travelling in the same direction.
 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=110.3_D=10.4_C=0.82] 
I also value the chance to look at various pieces of road infrastructure as part of the Public Works Committee - together with Ms Butler and Mr Wood, wh [Bookmark: Phr9_O=121.7_D=25.8_C=0.81] o are both on that committee. You can see why there are concerns and why these upgrades are seen as a priority for road safety. One of the most recent trips was to have a look at the Bridport Road and to consider the upgrades [Bookmark: Phr10_O=149.9_D=1.7_C=0.90]  which the department was looking at [Bookmark: Phr11_O=152.1_D=25.9_C=0.82] . On the Tasman Highway, the duplication of the Midway Point Causeway, including McGee's Bridge, will be something that will soon be open for public submissions, and I urge people to have their say in relation to this as it will be before the committee soon.

We are reminded that road upgrades are very important [Bookmark: Phr12_O=178.5_D=6.0_C=0.78] . I might read the concerns about that Leith turnoff on the Bass Highway. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=184.9_D=5.2_C=0.72]  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=192.0_D=18.7_C=0.88]  Sometimes getting a response can be difficult because of fatalities or serious incidents. That is again what the Road Safety Advisory Council was informing of us today [Bookmark: Phr15_O=214.3_D=6.2_C=0.64] . The elevated crash [Bookmark: Phr16_O=222.4_D=4.4_C=0.93]  history is the reason why sometimes these [Bookmark: Phr17_O=229.1_D=16.6_C=0.84]  improvements are considered. 

The number of crashes reduced by 46 per cent on a 1.2 kilometre section near Don after the speed limit was cut from 110 kilometres per hour to 90 kilometres per hour in 2006 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=245.9_D=23.0_C=0.79] . The crash rate has almost halved since the limit was cut from 110 to 90 kilometres along a 2.3 kilometre stretch west of the Heybridge roundabout in 2021. These are all important things to consider. It is not necessarily about spending the big bucks. It is looking at those other solutions as well.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=270.3_D=5.0_C=0.80] To the amendment, the Greens support the amendment. We have also had similar conversations amongst ourselves about trying to improve the rail network and getting that funding into a small budget [Bookmark: Phr21_O=295.2_D=9.2_C=0.81] , small GDP state such as Tasmania. It is important that we get that value for money which makes those investments and the upgrades that are required much more possible. We have the Tasman Bridge, for which I believe it might have been a 20:80 split -

Mr Ferguson - It was 50:50.

Ms BURNET - Those things are still not altered. They still have not been delivered by the government, and it is a really important and critical piece of infrastructure that needs that upgrade for the safety of all road users.

I will finish on that point, but the Greens will support this.

[7.32 p.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Deputy Speaker, we will not be supporting the motion that is before the House this afternoon. We will not be supporting the amendment because we see it as a political stunt during a federal election campaign. Quite frankly, I am amazed that the former failed Infrastructure minister would bring this forward today and have the audacity to start talking about infrastructure investment across the state when his track record speaks for itself. This is from a former minister who forgot to build a berth for our new billion-dollar ships, and his only solution was to instruct the then chairs of the state's GBEs to play nicely in the sandpit. As a former Infrastructure minister, he presided over project delay and overrun, over and over again. 

We have gone through the list of those infrastructure projects in this place before, but I am happy to add a couple more to the record: the underground bus mall, which we have never seen, and the Bass Highway between Burnie and Marrawah. We are still waiting for those upgrades on the road to Marrawah. They have been pushed out for years. It is unsafe for the community. The local council have made representation to this government. The money has been allocated to the state government but the work has not been done.

We all know the stories of the delays in getting contracts out by this government, as well as project overruns and poor Liberal government management of projects at a state and federal level, which, from what I understand, led to an independent review of the National Partnership Agreement on land transport infrastructure projects, which has brought us to this debate today.

The previous federal Liberal government left $33 billion in infrastructure cost blowouts, while our state government record speaks for itself. I do not need a motion from the former infrastructure minister to tell me about the importance of the Bass Highway corridor. I drive it every day. I live in the north-west, which is the engine room of the economy. The freight task that comes out of where I live, from our primary producers, from our rich resources and minerals, is a huge freight task. That corridor of road has been left for far too many years. 

It should have been upgraded years ago and this government has not done it. You only have to look at the maintenance of the surface on those roads. You have to look at the potholes that arise in each wet weather event - it is the worst part of the road for potholes. This government is responsible for that maintenance, for those contracts and they have not done the work. It is Tasmanians who suffer from that, and from the fact that they need to travel. A lot of people from the north-west also need to travel to access medical services because this government has downgraded medical services in the regions. 

It is pretty rich coming from this former Infrastructure minister to come in here and lecture us about infrastructure. My understanding is that federal Labor has been investing more than $330 million in projects along the Bass Highway, and any claims that this former minister makes about funding being cut for that vital passenger and freight route are simply untrue. I go on further to add that the majority of transport infrastructure projects across the state are already funded on an 80:20 basis, to my knowledge.

I believe that Peter Dutton, Michael Ferguson and the Coalition actually know that, but they are deliberately misleading Tasmanians. Of course, when we talk about duplication of highways, dual lanes in this state, one's mind draws back to the Midland Highway and that billboard years ago of Will Hodgman and Tony Abbott saying that we would have a four-lane Midland Highway. Well, what have we got? We do not have one.  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=7.8_D=10.4_C=0.83] Yet another project that was drawn out, that there were delays in, and a final product that was promised by a Coalition Liberal government that just was not delivered.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=20.0_D=4.8_C=0.84] I think that Tasmanians know better than to trust Peter Dutton and the Liberals. When it comes to that project, the funding that has been provided by the federal [Bookmark: Phr4_O=26.9_D=18.0_C=0.87]  Liberal Coalition is pretty undercooked. It is an unplanned project from a party who left the federal Labor government with $33 billion in infrastructure cost blowouts.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=46.2_D=24.9_C=0.82] As I have said, the Coalition were reckless with taxpayer dollars. If they are elected again, they will certainly be reckless again. I have no doubts about that. The 50:50 approach that has been taken by the federal government was actually recommended by an independent review. It means that projects must be properly planned and managed to avoid cost blowouts. 

Before I move on, I want to spend some time just looking at point (2) of the motion [Bookmark: Phr7_O=76.1_D=29.4_C=0.85] . My understanding, and I think that the failed Infrastructure minister understands this too, is that under the 50:50 ratio, that is a starting point. It is negotiated on a project by project basis. The amount of funding provided by the Commonwealth remains the same. There is not a red cent different. The federal government has committed $2 billion over 10 years to Tasmania for an infrastructure pipeline. The state would put the same amount of money in too. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=106.8_D=2.9_C=0.91]  The federal and state contributions are fixed.  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=110.9_D=29.6_C=0.84] Having a 50:50 contribution as a starting point of negotiations, that point has been very well made by the federal government. I refer to an article from the ABC where the honourable Catherine King was asked a question about this and she said that:

What we are asking is that we have reasonable sharing with states and territories about the roads that we are funding together.

Now, obviously, in some of the smaller jurisdictions, like the Northern Territory and Tasmania, that is a little more challenging and obviously we have indicated to both of those jurisdictions some flexibility around that.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=147.1_D=8.3_C=0.84] There is a willingness from the federal government to work with the smaller jurisdictions around this ratio and commitment.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=158.2_D=14.9_C=0.87] I was pleased to hear Mr Ferguson state that not all infrastructure projects are funded by the federal government: some are purely funded by the state government. It was good for him to reaffirm that, because I do not think his motion actually made that very clear before the House.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=174.2_D=29.6_C=0.84] A 50:50 split, in my understanding, enables the federal government to fund more projects across Tasmania. That is a very good thing. It holds state governments to account in the procurement process by them having more skin in the game in the delivery of on-time and on-budget projects. It came from an independent review. I really do not think Catherine King needs to take lessons as a federal Infrastructure minister from this failed state Infrastructure minister.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=204.9_D=28.3_C=0.80] We have all heard the stories of state infrastructure projects drying up. Our civil construction workers need more work and they need certainty on upcoming jobs. When I speak with the CCF, that is what they are telling me. The current contractual delays in the Department of State Growth are putting pressure on civil construction businesses and the industry overall.

In the instance of our roads they are often leading to poor outcomes,  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=233.3_D=30.0_C=0.79] because work is not being done within the right timeframes around weather, and the materials they have been using are not contingent to Tasmanian conditions. All the while Tasmania is suffering because their road conditions are deteriorating. That is not the fault of our civil construction industry or our road workers across the state. They do an absolutely amazing job, but they are being held up by an ineffective government that cannot get projects out the door and work for them to do -  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=263.5_D=17.1_C=0.69] work that they rely on, work that their workers and their families rely on to put food on their tables. That is no more real than across regional Tasmania. I want to put on the record my thanks to the civil construction industry across the state.
 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=283.4_D=8.0_C=0.82] 
In concluding, there was an interchange in the Senate back in May of last year, I believe, between, I have not got it in front on me,  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=293.7_D=8.6_C=0.80] Senator Bridget McKenzie, and I think throughout that exchange it became quite clear that - I know that the honourable  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=303.1_D=1.7_C=0.81] former minister has said that he raised his concerns with her to raise in a Senate Committee. I think the interaction that she had with government officials made it quite clear that this would enable and should enable more projects to be done across states, and it would mean that more regional projects could be done. Here it is, Tuesday 28 May 2024, and it is quite a long exchange there, but I think if the minister read it for himself he would come to the same conclusion that Senator McKenzie did. He would draw some of those conclusions, which I have put on the record today as well, about the fact that there is no lesser funding, that that 50:50 split is a negotiating position to start from, and that the actual intent is for there to be more projects done in partnerships with state governments across the country, rather than less.

I want to finish finally by saying that it is my understanding that this is all about managing overruns and holding governments to account across the country. If this same sort of accountability extended over your Spirits debacle, perhaps you would have been a little bit swifter to actually get the berth built and deliver what you promised to Tasmanians.

I want to finally say that my understanding, as I said at the beginning of my contribution, that many of the projects in Tasmania at the moment are under an 80:20 agreement, and that will not change. In summing up, the state Liberals have shown today that they do not understand their own budget, they do not understand their own energy policy, and they do not understand how federal infrastructure partnerships work.

[7.43 p.m.]
Mr FAIRS (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I thank Ms Dow for her contribution and the others to this. I do have a question, because from what I heard is it seems that state Labor has just affirmed that they will stand with their federal friends more than the Tasmanian people.

Mr Abetz - Shame.

Mr FAIRS - My question to Ms Dow and the state opposition is very simple: why walk away? Do you not want more funding for Tasmania for future projects?

Ms Dow - It is same amount of funding. It does not change. The contributions are fixed.

The SPEAKER - Ms Dow.

Mr FAIRS - I do not understand why you are against that. Anyway, I rise as a member for Bass in support of the member for Bass, my fellow colleague, and pass on my thanks for the work that Michael Ferguson did as a minister to help force the backdown from the Albanese government on a draft agreement with our state that would have seen Australian governments reduce their share of funding from the long accepted 80:20 ratio to 50:50.

If that had transpired, we could kiss goodbye to the future projects such as the duplication of the Bass Highway between Launceston and Deloraine, which we know would be supported by 80 per cent funding from a federal Coalition government. I call on members of the state opposition to speak to their federal counterparts and confirm their commitment to the established 80:20 road infrastructure funding ratio. Tasmania's future depends on it.

The Bass Highway is the key freight link for our ports, and it is playing a vital role in the agriculture, forestry and mining industries. It is also the chief means of connection for family and friends in the communities of the north-west coast right through to Launceston. Our long-term strategy recognises this, improving safety and increasing productivity by providing a more efficient road corridor.

We went to the last year's election with an exciting plan to continue this investment in the Bass Highway, including $20 million towards a consistent four-lane link between Launceston and Deloraine; $40 billion for the highway west of Wynyard, and $10 million towards upgrades between Deloraine and Devonport.
We welcome the commitment of the federal Leader of the opposition, Peter Dutton, that a federal Coalition government would support the Tasmanian Government's policy to duplicate  the Bass Highway between Launceston and Deloraine. We committed $20 million to that section of highway in our election policy last year and the federal Liberals will back that with $80 million of Australian Government funding. This policy to duplicate the highway is backed by the Bass Highway Launceston to Devonport corridor strategy. We already have the easements and road reserves in place and ready for much of this work.

Our budget also contains a number of projects that have been committed to by our government contingent upon Australian government contributions on the long-established 80:20 proportional basis. These include $136 million for a new Tamar bridge, which has now seen $20 million in federal funding committed for planning. The recent federal budget also included matching funds for things like the Devonport-to-Cradle Mountain corridor, with $2.5 million for planning. These commitments were welcomed by the Tasmanian government, but ad hoc funding commitments without any firm vow to re-establish the 80:20 funding split gives us as a government and the men and women of our civil contracting industry little confidence to plan and invest for the future.

As a member for Bass, I will make some comments on the government's investment in state roads in my electorate and in the north. The Tasmanian and Australian governments have committed $80 million to upgrading the Illawarra Main Road, the Australian Government contributing $64 million and the Tasmanian government contributing $16 million. The Illawarra Main Road is a key link in our state road network and provides access to the freight hubs between Hobart and the north and north-west regions of Tasmania.

Our government has allocated $136 million towards the construction of the second Tamar River crossing between the West Tamar Highway and the East Tamar Highway north of University Way in Newnham. This commitment was matched by the Australian government's commitment of $20 million towards planning for the bridge in March. Public consultation began on the bridge in late March and will continue until mid-April. The public feedback has been great to see. I picked up The Examiner the other day and could see the northern Tasmanian community is very much engaged on this bridge already. They have already voted in favour of their favourite bridge, albeit the most expensive one. I urge the community to keep the feedback flowing as we embark on building more infrastructure for Tasmanians to utilise for generations to come.

Our government's commitment to a new Tamar River bridge is in stark contrast to the Labor Party, which has never committed to a second river crossing for the people of Launceston, including through the 2021 and 2024 election campaigns. Our state commitment is included in our budget papers and is based on the long-accepted 80:20 proportional funding that was agreed by the former federal Coalition government for the Bridgewater bridge and the Midland Highway 10-Year Action Plan.

The government's engineering consultants have finalised their work, including an extra alignment option, and the business case was submitted to Infrastructure Australia in late February 2024. This is the type of infrastructure our growing state needs, and a Tasmanian Liberal government will back it to the hilt.

Amendment agreed to.

[7.50 p.m.]
Mr FERGUSON (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I appreciate the debate we have just had. I did not quite expect it to go like that. That was one of the nastiest, most bitter contributions from Ms Dow. I was disappointed. I am aware of the basis for your personal attack, but that speech does you no credit at all. That is something you may or may not be proud of in years to come. However, I appreciate the comments made by Ms Burnet, member for Clark, and my colleague member for Bass, Mr Fairs.

To respond briefly, this is about standing up for Tasmania. I do not regret bringing forward a motion that did not have the politics in the wording of the motion. I wanted to get everyone to vote for this. I am surprised and disappointed, and believe other members are too, that the Labor Party would form a negative position on this. Earlier in the day, the government supported a motion that was pressing the point on some other important projects to our state that was intended as a political wedge. 

I still commend this motion to the House and am grateful for the debate. What we are looking for here is the sort of unity in the House with people from different political persuasions [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.2_D=4.2_C=0.56]  that we witnessed last year around ministerial council tables [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.8_D=5.5_C=0.88]  between ministers for infrastructure and treasurers of different political backgrounds. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=38.4_D=22.7_C=0.83]  That is what we can do and that is what I want to see. 

I will address one point that makes the argument as to why the states and territories have stood firm on this. We saw it as a threat. It continues to be the case. It is a federal policy position [Bookmark: Phr5_O=61.6_D=6.4_C=0.80]  that projects can be negotiated on a case-for-case basis. However, are you going to pin your hopes on that [Bookmark: Phr6_O=69.1_D=1.1_C=0.31] ? Are Labor Party members going to leave it to chance? [Bookmark: Phr8_O=78.3_D=0.3_C=0.62]  I am not [Bookmark: Phr9_O=79.8_D=29.8_C=0.81] , when there is a policy position that projects ought to be 50:50 unless otherwise negotiated on a case-for-case basis. 

The government is proud of incredible infrastructure investments that have been successfully delivered and are currently in the pipeline. We have changed the shape of Tasmania through the infrastructure build that has, on the one hand, dealt with legacy under-investment and, on the other [Bookmark: Phr10_O=110.4_D=19.8_C=0.81]  hand, responded to economic, social and population growth that we have enjoyed in Tasmania. I look in particular at the Midland Highway. I am thrilled to think how much safer that highway is compared to years before. It has been a journey for many people. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=131.7_D=8.4_C=0.81]  I do not mind the criticism on the four-lane Midland Highway billboard because it is easily explained to a Labor Party that know [Bookmark: Phr12_O=140.6_D=10.4_C=0.73] s that was a commitment made in an election that we did not win. I do not know why you bring it up.

At the election that we did win, when [Bookmark: Phr13_O=152.7_D=25.0_C=0.82]  Tasmanians elected a Liberal majority government, the commitment was very different. The commitment was that we were going to do a 10-year Midland Highway safety action plan to bring the entire highway up to Australian Road Assessment Program (AusRAP) three-star rating. It disappoints me, Ms Dow, as the shadow infrastructure spokesperson, that you did not have either the knowledge or the grace to say that [Bookmark: Phr14_O=178.6_D=6.6_C=0.69]  at the election that we did win. That has been a successful partnership between the Hodgman and Abbott governments [Bookmark: Phr15_O=185.9_D=28.9_C=0.68] , then the Gutwein and Rockliff and Morrison and Albanese governments. It has been a successful partnership through those changes of leaders and through those different colours in Canberra.

Catherine King, to her credit, continues to support the action plan that a previous government had signed up to with the Hodgman government under then minister Rene Hidding. These are the things we should at least put aside some of our differences [Bookmark: Phr16_O=216.6_D=24.7_C=0.68]  on and have the grace to agree that there are people alive today because of that work. We have virtually eliminated the chance of head-on collisions on that highway. Do you not remember what it was like growing up in this state? I nearly lost an uncle and a cousin on that highway. It is a miracle they survived it [Bookmark: Phr17_O=242.3_D=19.4_C=0.55] . I know others - and I am sure others here do too - who have not survived that highway. There is no guarantee, but we have virtually eliminated the chance of a head-on collision because instead of taking a three- or four-lane approach, it has been an AusRAP three-star safety rating approach. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=262.4_D=6.0_C=0.78]  We ought to be able to agree on that. We ought to be proud together of those achievements. I am.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=270.2_D=20.4_C=0.83] I thank the House for its time and consideration of this important motion. I believe that between now and 3 May, with the right pressure, we can get a bipartisan position to restore the longstanding and successful 80:20 formula, not just for Tasmania's benefit but for the people right around our beautiful country.

Swift Parrot Breeding Habitat Deforestation

[8.02 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to provide the House with a very important research paper from researchers at the Australian National University, published in the journal Nature, Quantifying forest degradation, deforestation and land use change in vital swift parrot breeding habitat. This paper quantifies the extent to which swift parrot habitat has been destroyed in recent decades and discusses the drivers of habitat loss.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=63.8_D=29.8_C=0.86] The findings of the paper are sobering. More than 37 per cent of the swift parrots breeding range was permanently deforested prior to 2000. Since then, a quarter of the swift parrots' breeding range has been disturbed, degraded or permanently deforested. Production forestry has been the main driver of forest loss, and rates of forest loss doubled after the Hodgman Liberal government introduced the Forestry (Rebuilding the Forest Industry) Act 2014.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=93.7_D=29.6_C=0.82] The report makes clear the effects of forest degradation versus deforestation on the extinction risk of the swift parrot. We all understand what impact deforestation has on swift parrot habitat. Clear-felling and land conversion removes habitat entirely from the ecosystem. Degradation refers to instances where total forest area may remain constant, but the quality of the forest in terms of its:

… structure, function, composition and capacity to provide ecosystem services.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=130.9_D=27.0_C=0.74] is reduced. Swift parrots need spatially diverse, unbroken stretches of forest with large, structurally complex old growth trees with nesting hollows and other features that provide them with protection. Forestry practices in Tasmania either clear-fell and log swift parrot habitat entirely or fragmented, leaving isolated islands of:

… retained habitat that are functionally useless to Swift parrots.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=158.6_D=26.3_C=0.82] People in this place love to remind the Greens that forests regrow. Forests do regrow, but a 25-year-old regrowth forest is incredibly different to a 300-year-old growth forest. It is in the latter forests that swift parrots find habitat, not in the former 25-year-old types of forests. I quote this important research:

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=186.0_D=12.7_C=0.80] Land use and change analysis shows that production forestry is the dominant anthropogenic driver of forest loss, followed by forestry in areas previously or subsequently managed for conservation, and conversion of native forest to plantations.

Forestry is driving the extinction of the swift parrot: not bushfires, not invasive species, but Forestry Tasmania operations in all their insidious forms. This is in contrast to the mainland, where bushfires and climate change are the main drivers of habitat loss. The threats to the swift parrot and all species on Earth are obviously exacerbated by climate change, but we do not need to help climate change along by removing 75 per cent of the swift parrots' habitat ourselves by logging.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=229.3_D=29.7_C=0.85] The paper shows that forest loss in swift parrot breeding areas dramatically increased after the implementation of the Liberal government's destructive Forestry (Rebuilding the Forest Industry) Act 2014. Between 2001 and 2013, the authors found the rate of forest loss in swift parrot habitat was decreasing by 139 hectares a year, and after 2014, the rate more than doubled to  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=259.4_D=29.9_C=0.76] 329 hectares lost per year. To quote the paper, the 2014 policy change led to a notable and sustained rise in annual anthropogenic forest loss within important swift parrot breeding areas. This paper modelled a counterfactual scenario that showed that if the Liberals' Forestry (Rebuilding the Forest Industry) Act 2014 had never been implemented, the rate of forest loss in swift parrot habitat would have declined to zero by the year 2023, two years ago.  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=289.9_D=2.1_C=0.74] I want to dwell on that point for a moment.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=292.9_D=12.0_C=0.82] The Greens, environmental organisations, community members and independent scientists have worked for many years to demonstrate the scientific rationale for the Tasmanian Forest Agreement and the incredible importance of Tasmania's forests for the conservation of species like the swift parrot. Hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars were spent on paying out forestry contractors and beginning the just transition away from native forest logging in this state. It was all undone overnight by the Hodgman Liberal government when they came to power in 2014. This paper and these researchers have rigorously and unarguably demonstrated the extinction of the swift parrot is overwhelmingly being driven by the Liberals' abandonment of the Tasmania Forest Agreement. 

I want to table this paper, which I have circulated to members beforehand - 

Time expired.

The SPEAKER - The member's time has expired. I will seek advice from Clerk on whether you can table something after the time has expired.

The question is that leave be granted.

Mr Winter - No.

Leave granted.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Issues with Dr Gruen's Report

[8.07 p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight on the Adjournment to raise a number of serious questions relating to the Gruen Report, particularly in its establishment that, in my view, cast a shadow over its findings and recommendations, particularly following the publishing of the ABC report today. 

In January of this year, when the Gruen report was released, I penned an opinion piece for the Mercury newspaper outlining a number of serious concerns I had with Dr Gruen's findings, the methodology used, and the assumptions he had made. It was not a personal attack on Doctor Gruen, but rather a critique on his work. A critique of work, regardless of topic, is something I know most economists welcome. In the following weeks, I was subjected to a deeply personal, offensive online attack by the organisation Our Place. It accused me of not having read the report, of bias, of distortion and of attacking Dr Gruen personally, amongst other slurs. I know that the group Our Place and I do not agree on the issue of the Macquarie Stadium, but I thought that rant - for want of the better way to describe it - was beneath them. I was always confused about why they went so hard on me in defence of the Gruen report, as I have made many comments about the stadium over the journey and I had not been subjected to such a vitriolic and personal attack. 

That was until I was forwarded a piece written by Roland Browne, a key figure in Our Place, on their website, describing an exchange he had had with local ABC journalist Chris Robottom. At the outset, let me say that the attack on Mr Robottom in this online piece is disgraceful and, in my view, one of the most appalling personal attacks on a journalist I have seen in my time in public life. Mr Robottom is a well regarded and respected journalist known for his investigative pieces.

To the substance of the issue. In the first week of January, the Gruen report was made public after some six months of meetings, consultation and work. It was presented to the government at some stage prior to that and outlined his findings, whom he met with and how he conducted his work. That was a public document and one that was well read and debated.

We now know that Dr Gruen on uploaded a version of the report accessible by a public link that updated the section of consultation meetings to include meetings that he had failed to disclose to the Tasmanian government and the Tasmanian people. May I make the point, we have still not been formally updated. When asked about this, Dr Gruen said it was an administrative error. I also understand that when Dr Gruen fronted Public Accounts Committee a few weeks ago, the report he submitted was the original report, not his updated report with the full disclosure on who he met with.

Looking at the dates: April 16, some three weeks before it was publicly announced that Dr Gruen had been appointed by the government to conduct the report, he, on the recommendation from the JLN, and prior to him being appointed and without knowledge of the government, he met with representatives from Our Place; Roland Browne and Richard Flanagan. It also seems that over 16 and 17 April, representatives from the JLN were negotiating with the state government the terms of reference for the report on the stadium. Dr Gruen was presented to the government to do the report as a take it or leave it demand by the JLN. 

Based on the version of the report he presented to the Tasmanian government, he conducted his first official consultation on 12 June. The Premier confirmed these dates in Question Time today. This begs the question: why were the April meetings with the anti-stadium campaigners not disclosed in his report? What impact have those secret meetings had on the framing of the work of Dr Gruen? What discussions were had between the JLN and Our Place on the terms of reference?

When questions were put to Mr Browne from Our Place about their involvement, he responded by saying, 'Dr Gruen was the first person on behalf of the Tas government to consult with me or any local resident or community group about the proposed stadium.' That may be correct, and, of course, he should consult with Our Place and others, but the issue is he had not even been appointed to the job. If it was as innocent as Mr Browne claims, why was it not disclosed? When Mr Browne was asked why this meeting was not disclosed, he responded by saying, 'I never examined that part of his report.' Mr Browne was very quick to accuse me of not reading the report and so for him to say he had not read the section that outlines whom Dr Gruen met with simply does not pass the pub test. This raises significant concerns in my mind about the ability of the report to be used as any form of reference.

In my view, this report now needs to be set aside as this failure to disclose means that it cannot be considered genuinely independent.

Let me pose this question. If you remove stadium in Our Place and insert, say, gaming and industry lobbyists or salmon industry players, then there would be an explosion in here and across the community. 

Have these meetings led to a predetermined outcome to sink the stadium? It seems they have. I will not go as far as those Jacqui Lambie members and say, 'Stick it up your bum', but the process around this report definitely stinks, because they have stuck it somewhere and it stinks.


Salmon Mass Mortality Crisis - Comments made by Members of the Greens

[8.12 p.m.]
Dr BROAD (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I rise on Adjournment to reflect on some of the comments that were made during the MPI debate earlier today. I have seen some pretty strange things in this place, and I think that the way that the Greens are behaving lately is straying a long way from what is in the public interest.

I am talking in particular about the salmon industry. We know that the disease that has impacted the salmon industry has been a terrible incident and has had wide-scale impact, not only on the industry but on the beaches of Tasmania and so on. We hear that the disease is bad, but of course the Greens are also thinking that the treatment for disease is also bad. What they are actually doing is being either deliberately ignorant or spreading misinformation.

I will give some examples of that. I believe today in question time, and indeed in previous question times, we have actually had well-reasoned answers from minister Jaensch in explaining that the disease that is impacting the salmon industry in Tasmania at the moment is not dangerous to humans. It is safe for human consumption and yet we hear in this place today wild allegations about food safety. Indeed, the member for Braddon, Mr Garland, also commented on an unsubstantiated allegation that diseased salmon is causing human health issues at the moment.

If that is the case, then please put forward a real example of that. We know that most of the issues with food safety are to do with preparation and storage, not an outbreak of a fish disease in fish. I have seen the Greens do this a number of times when they deliberately do not listen when a rational explanation is given - once again I will repeat it: this disease is not dangerous to humans. Then we see the other misinformation and deliberate ignorant comments when the Greens deliberately are uninformed about how the salmon industry is regulated.

Just for the record, the administration of antibacterial compounds in feed is not regulated by the Environment Protection Authority (EPA). Food safety is not regulated by the EPA. The same regulations that apply to salmon apply to every single agricultural product. If you wanted to administer antibiotics to a cow, then there are things like limits on slaughter. There are residue limits if that animal is taken to slaughter, and there are also withholding periods for things like animal products. 

For example, if you inject a cow with antibiotics, if it is a milking cow, there are withholding periods. You cannot send that milk to the factory. If it is an animal for slaughter, you cannot send that animal to slaughter, because residue limits are set by FSANZ - Food Safety Australia and New Zealand - which regulates the application. They regulate the residue limits and the withholding periods. These chemicals - whatever it is, in whatever industry - have to be regulated. They are also regulated by the AVPMA, and that is to do with any pesticide or any chemical or any medicine that animals use. It is not regulated by the EPA, and yet we hear this thing where they try and conflate the issues. 'Oh, we need an EPA with teeth.' The EPA's job is not to regulate the amount of antibiotic that is given to fish in fish feed. That is not their job. Like every other product, it is regulated exactly the same and we see this.

Do you honestly believe that if there was a food safety issue with salmon that the industry would not be shut down? Of course it would be shut down. We have seen it before. A classic example is the paralytic shellfish disease outbreak, where entire industries across the east coast of Tasmania were shut down for months. That was lobsters, mussels and abalone - all shut down. It was all shut down because it was dangerous to human health. These are the same regulators that are telling the Greens, through the minister, that this salmon is still safe to eat, and yet, we have them come in and try to spread what is misinformation or deliberate ignorance.

They try to spread fear in our community that if they go to the supermarket and eat salmon, they are putting themselves in danger. The only way they are putting themselves in danger with respect to food safety is if they do not store it appropriately or if they do not prepare it appropriately. They are the real dangers for food safety, yet we hear the Greens trying to conflate massive issues and deliberately misinform and scare the public. That is not their role. They need to be honest.

24 Carrot Gardens

[8.17 p.m.]
Mr FAIRS (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about a wonderful community educational food program called 24 Carrot Gardens. It teaches young people how to grow, harvest, prepare and share fresh seasonal food. 24 Carrot Gardens was founded in 2014 by MONA curator and artist Kirsha Kaechele, and I congratulate Kirsha on her vision and dedication.

One huge thing I love about this program is that it not only mentors youngsters, but builds relationships and gives them real life skills that they can use for the rest of their lives. On Monday I had the pleasure of visiting Reuben and Amelia at 24 Carrots' botanical garden site at Bridgewater. It was a wonderful experience. Walking into the place, I felt very relaxed. I had a firsthand look at their facilities including their greenhouses, which, I hate to admit, are growing much bigger and better fruit and veggies than I ever can. It still upsets me.

I also had a look at their new kitchen, which was made possible thanks to the Tasmanian Community Fund. This is another way that 24 Carrot Gardens teaches youngsters how to prepare and cook the veggies that they grow, enhancing the skill sets that they are going to use, obviously, for the rest of their lives.

24 Carrot Gardens currently works with students' sustainable practice to enrich food education for young people. A sister campus is the Material Institute New Orleans, which also runs a 24 Carrot Garden program, providing youth and community programming in New Orleans' ninth ward.

The passionate team currently works with 24 schools across Tassie to create positive change in communities where there is limited access to locally grown nutritious food. Some of the schools involved at present are Risdon Vale Primary and Montrose High down here in the south, East Tamar and Ravenswood Heights Primary in the north, and on the north-west coast, East Devonport, Montello and Romaine Park primary schools.

I recently had the honour of representing Education minister Jo Palmer at Ravenswood Heights Primary School in my electorate of Bass, and officially opened its school garden. It was wonderful to see the students so passionate and dedicated, showing so much pride in the garden and the produce they had grown and reminding me of how bad a gardener I was. I have to admit they are not wrong; I am terrible.

24 Carrot Gardens runs programs every Tuesday for students, not only about gardening but also arts, making things with clay, and as I mentioned before, cooking. I have to say that the thing I love most about 24 Carrot Gardens is that it involves youngsters and gets them outdoors, learning true and crucial life skills and opportunities. Most importantly, this program gets our kids outdoors - not inside, not on their phones, tablets and iPads - and I reckon that is a great thing.

Well done to the awesome team: Reuben, Amelia and the rest of the gang. Finally, I send a message to all the kids to keep up the great work and keep growing.


Automotive Industry in Tasmania

[8.20 p.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, the automotive industry in this state needs certainty. Between local structural changes and global market shifts, it deserves aspirational and futuristic planning. We all drive cars, so we are all reliant on mechanics being fully trained to keep our cars running and to ensure road and vehicle safety for all. The recent flooding at TasTAFE's Campbell Street campus has been the impetus for training changes in Tasmania. However, thorough future-proofing and long-term planning should have been underway long ago.

The Campbell Street facility - where I did most of my training - has been subpar for a while, and that has been expressed by teachers and students. In August 2024, a serious complaint was made regarding fumes and carbon monoxide in the building. This led to an investigation in late October, so what occurred with the poisoning incident in November was devastating and avoidable. 

A week later the flooding occurred. This was at the end of the teaching year, so there was an entire summer to prepare for the 2025 training year, time to ensure clean communication with employers and with students [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.6_D=5.9_C=0.87]  but what employers and trainees have heard so far about future training [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.9_D=27.8_C=0.83]  has been inconsistent and totally uncommitted. We are still hearing from employers who are confused about when and where apprentices are required to go and what exactly for. 

TAFE said on 3 February that its insurance assessor advised that the ground floor and basement of the Campbell Street building would not be operational until sometime in 2026. Today we have heard from the minister that that insurance assessment process is actually still underway. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=60.1_D=28.9_C=0.78]  On 27 February, the TAFE Consultation and Communication Plan stated that a building in Rokeby has been identified. In 2026, are we looking at Campbell Street, Rokeby, or both? 
On the trade training centres as an interim alternative, as I have outlined in a previous adjournment, they are not sufficiently equipped for the type of hands-on training that is most needed. Now, we hear that the Department for Education, Children and Young People is, understandably, requiring apprentices to hold a Working with Vulnerable People card if they are in those centres. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=89.2_D=25.2_C=0.83]  For a myriad of reasons, folks training might not be able to acquire that card and it is not a mandatory part of the mechanical training or, indeed, mandatory for a mechanical career. What is the government doing to assist these learners? Are there reimbursements for these checks and cards? Will apprentices who are not going to be able to use the trade training centres because they do not have a card have to join the others having to go to Launceston for their hands-on training?

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=115.1_D=26.0_C=0.86] These are all structural changes, but we are also seeing a huge industry and consumer change in the global car market. There is a need to adapt to the rapid change to ensure training in the required skills is available in Tasmania so that we can service the increasing number of EVs and ensure that all internal combustion engine vehicles on our roads are maintained at the appropriate emissions standard.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=141.9_D=29.9_C=0.81] The decision to force staff out of their jobs was totally unacceptable. The minister oversaw these job losses despite the absence of a plan for this critical training program moving forward. Some of the people who have left TasTAFE were revered mechanics not only in Australia but in global motorsport. The networks, the expertise and the skills they chose to bring to TasTAFE and our state's automotive sector are unparalleled. This government should be embarrassed for [Bookmark: Phr8_O=172.0_D=30.0_C=0.80]  treating these legends in the way that they have.

With the southern workforce halved, I am hearing industry concern that the government is looking to deliver cheap, smaller and, ultimately, inadequate automotive training programs. The training will be reduced to classroom-based, book-based learning, with the hands-on delivery just in the north. This learning plan is completely inadequate. It is the integration of theory with practice that is the tried-and-true best [Bookmark: Phr9_O=202.2_D=29.9_C=0.78]  method for learning, especially for trades. The minister himself knows this. 

The minister's evasive nature upon questioning this morning proves that he needs a good idea for the future of automotive in Tasmania, so here it is: build an automotive Centre of Excellence. Invest in the industry's future. This is a huge opportunity. Let us have a state-of-the-art workshop and learning facilities in Tasmania, ensure courses for EV tech across all learning levels -

Mr Jaensch - You hate cars.

Ms BADGER - Mr Jaensch, it is not a joke. This is a serious thing we should be having. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=232.3_D=20.3_C=0.83]  TAFE plays a crucial role in supporting Tasmanian jobs and ensuring our industries keep up with rapid technological change. We need more trade training investment and an ambitious vision for the future, not job cuts. An automotive centre of excellence will give our state a huge boost and the minister needs to get on board and make it a reality.


Bike Lanes and Safety

[8.25 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) -  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=254.4_D=1.4_C=0.39]  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=264.2_D=26.7_C=0.88] Honourable Speaker, from one mode of transport to another: much has been said on bike lanes in the past few weeks, whether it be about safety, use of the urban commons, benefits to the environment, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, or general fitness and health and wellbeing improvements. At the public meeting on Tuesday 25 March, even though there was a strong argument and vote that evening in favour of installing bike lanes, there is another push for an elector poll against the Collins Street bike lanes.
 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=301.6_D=3.4_C=0.75] 
This evening I will focus on safety. Whether we support bike lanes or not, safety is something we can all agree on. In the decade from 2014 to 2024, there were 718 crashes between vehicle and active transport users in Hobart, which is a phenomenal amount. Of those incidents, 207 involved bikes, and that is probably a lower calculation than it should be.

Road safety is a huge issue. The Road Safety Advisory Council spoke to members of the crossbench today at a briefing and told us that the year-to-date fatalities on Tasmanian roads is 13, compared to seven deaths this time last year. That is too many lives lost and, overall, there are too many injuries. The Greens acknowledge these tragedies and the hole this leaves for affected families, friends and communities. I also acknowledge one of the champions of road safety, Peter Fraser. 

Peter Fraser, the president of the Safer Australian Roads and Highways group, SARAH, was in Hobart on Tuesday to promote the council's two-year Transforming Collins Street trial, which is expected to officially begin next month. Mr Fraser, whose 23-year-old daughter, Sarah, was killed in a roadside crash on the Hume Highway in New South Wales in 2012, said vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists should be able to be safe on every street He told the Mercury:

Having experienced the loss of our beautiful daughter, Sarah Fraser, which took me into this space 13 years ago, you realise that the grief that people suffer either from being seriously injured themselves or from losing someone is a lifetime thing.

We need to recognise that all of us have to actively look after each other on our roads and highways. What is going on in Hobart on Collins Street is the start of saying, 'We are changing the behaviour of people. We are going to make certain that people are safe on the street.' Peter Fraser said:
The work that is happening right here in Collins Street is going to not only save injuries and potentially lives but will also improve the amenity of the city.

Let us invest in the infrastructure and make biking safer for everyone. 

Bike riding is a bit like elections and swing voters. Just like the major parties, votes are declining. We need to get people out of cars and on a functioning bus system, onto bikes or walking. For bike riders, that percentage will only increase once people are confident to ride. You need to target the people who would cycle but are not confident enough to ride. Adding separate bike lanes would benefit these people and attract many of the 60 per cent of people who are interested in riding but who have concerns about safety. They are your swinging voters in the comparison. 

Cyclists bring enormous benefits to our community. They reduce the carbon footprint, congestion and invest in local businesses. I put a challenge to local businesses: many of your employees, your customers, your clients, your family and friends and even perhaps you are bike riders. Why not present the problem of the Collins Street bike lanes as a huge opportunity for better patronage and for a healthier and safer city? 


Ugadi Festival Hobart

[8.30 p.m.]
Ms OGILVIE (Clark - Minister for the Arts and Heritage) - Honourable Speaker, I was delighted to join our important and much-loved Indian and Hindu communities recently on behalf of the minister, Roger Jaensch, and the Tasmanian government to celebrate one of their most important days of the year. It was the festival that is hosted by the Indian Festivals Association of Tasmania. It is a group of people who work tirelessly and diligently and who organised what was the biggest one of these events that I have seen in the new venue at City Hall. It was beautifully decorated. There were small businesses, lots of different food from different regions in India and, as always, wonderful music, dancing and performances: just a great celebration.

It is always a delight to join in one of the culturally interesting and fun events. 

This one is an important highlight on the Hindu calendar. It is the Lunar New Year festival and it is called Ugadi - get that pronunciation right. The skills and efforts of volunteers and supporters with these community groups just cannot be  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.7_D=1.2_C=0.81] underscored enough [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.3_D=25.7_C=0.72] : the performers who do the beautiful dances and the musicians, particularly with the drums. I noticed our drummer this year had his son on stage, he had his drum and it was obviously being handed down the generations. It was just a beautiful thing to see: a vibrant, fun event, obviously very popular with people streaming in later in the evening. 

We know that New Year is an important waypoint [Bookmark: Phr4_O=57.6_D=5.3_C=0.69]  on what the Hindus see as their ongoing passage of renewal and growth [Bookmark: Phr5_O=63.3_D=30.0_C=0.84] . That is something I think that speaks to us and resonates with all of us. It gives us the opportunity to reflect on our accomplishments over the past year and have some pride and optimism for the future.

The Hindu community has a strong, vibrant and thriving presence right across Tasmania and the Indian diaspora plays an integral role in shaping our diverse and inclusive society. They have very rich cultural, religious, linguistic and culinary traditions. Every time I am with them I remind the Indian community that my grandparents migrated to Tasmania from India themselves, and so we feel that we have a personal and very warm historic connection.

Celebrations like Ugadi give Tasmanians, give all of us, the chance to embrace diversity and to learn from each other [Bookmark: Phr7_O=119.8_D=3.3_C=0.92] . The important contribution that the Hindu community makes  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=123.5_D=3.4_C=0.72] to building our strong and vibrant community is recognised.  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=128.6_D=24.2_C=0.74] I have mentioned that a number of times. It was just beautiful to see over many years I have been going to these things, some of the kids who have grown up. They are now doing the traditional ballets and dances, and I just saw how strong that whole scene is.
We, as Tasmanians - I know in this Chamber in particular - really value our multicultural festivals and communities [Bookmark: Phr10_O=153.9_D=26.1_C=0.85] . Coming together to embrace unique identities and ancestries in the way that we do, in a very warm and inclusive way, even though it was a chilly night, is a wonderful thing that we do in Tasmania. These sorts of gatherings exemplify how we can continue to build a harmonious and inclusive society.

I know Mr Jaensch would like me to mention a few of the great things that he has been doing  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=180.8_D=1.7_C=0.83] in government [Bookmark: Phr12_O=183.1_D=29.6_C=0.81] . Tasmania's Indian community has helped shape 'Embracing Diversity, Fostering Belonging: Tasmania's Multicultural Action Plan 2025 to 2029', which was launched on 28 March this year. Great work. It sets the vision for that balanced, inclusive and respectful multicultural island that I know we all want, because it is a wonderful place to belong. We as the government, of course, appreciate the commitment of the Indian community, not just to [Bookmark: Phr13_O=213.1_D=25.6_C=0.82]  our cultural life, but also to our state's economy and our quality of life. We have attempted, I think well, to capture that in the plans and our engagement as a government. I think I speak on behalf of everybody in this Chamber when I again wish everybody prosperity, peace and happiness, particularly to the Hindu community of Tasmania throughout 2025.


Parliamentary Budget Office - Proposal

[8.35 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=239.6_D=1.8_C=0.22]  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=245.5_D=25.5_C=0.76] Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to continue my talk on the support of the establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Office, which I was cut short on earlier today. I think the best explanation for the need for and importance of the PBO comes from the Treasurer himself. I want to continue reading from his second reading speech to the Commonwealth Parliament in 2010 when he introduced the Parliamentary Budget Office Bill.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=273.0_D=16.8_C=0.85] On Thursday 24 June 2010, senator Barnett rose to speak on the introduction into Parliament of a bill for an act to establish a parliamentary budget office and for related purposes:

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=291.9_D=13.0_C=0.77] The need for the PBO arises from the reckless and wasteful spending we have seen and continue to see from the Rudd Labor Government.  Labor’s debt and deficits, questionable budget accounting assumptions, and billions of dollars in Government financial waste demonstrate the need for independent scrutiny. Labor has wasted billions of dollars under the Building the Education Revolution (BER) and Home Insulation Programs alone, to the shock and dismay of many hard working Australians. 
For this reason the Coalition is introducing a package of two initiatives, including this Bill to establish the PBO and also a bill to strengthen the requirement for value for money to be achieved in the spending of Government funds.

…

The object of the Parliamentary Budget Office Act 2010 (the 'Act') is to establish an independent statutory office of Parliamentary Budget Officer to enhance transparency and accountability by providing objective and impartial advice and analysis on the Commonwealth budget and budget cycle, including the financial and economic impact of major policy announcements.

The establishment of a PBO will improve the quality of government spending. Greater scrutiny and transparency of Commonwealth Budgets will deliver better fiscal outcomes and will be an impediment to future Labor governments engaging in further reckless spending.

…

The Parliamentary Budget Officer is accountable to the Parliament, not the Executive, and will put the legislature on a more equal footing with the Executive with regard to budget information and analysis. A Parliamentary Budget Office will serve both the majority and the minority and may, by resolution of the Parliament, be asked to report to a nominated parliamentary committee or committees.  It is envisaged that the PBO may be asked to appear before one committee of the Senate and one committee of the house.

…

As an independent officer of the parliament, properly resourced and with appropriate flexibility, the Parliamentary Budget Officer will contribute greatly to a better-informed debate about fiscal policy and the consequences of government decision making, and will therefore help to deliver better outcomes. It is the Coalition’s belief that this initiative will, over time, improve the quality of Government spending regardless of who holds the reins of power, thus ensuring that all Australians get better value for money and restoring public confidence in the budget and budget process.

No future government will be able to spend taxpayers’ money without greater fiscal and legal scrutiny. Governments will not always like additional scrutiny and accountability, but given the reckless, wasteful and irresponsible spending of the Rudd Labor Government over the past two and a half years, the Coalition believes this initiative is timely and urgently needed.

I commend the Bill to the Senate.

I think we desperately need the same thing here. Honourable Speaker, thank you.

Housing Crisis

[8.39 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Chair, a home is not just a basic need, it is a fundamental human right that is our responsibility as legislators to meet, and the Liberals' obligation as a government to support.

In the dual cost-of-living and housing crises, finding an affordable home is getting harder, and for some people it is impossible. As the crisis has worsened, the Liberals have sat on their hands for years now, pretending to care, feigning action, but doing precious little to do anything meaningful about it.

New data released just this week from SGS Economics & Planning and National Shelter shows that rents already at record highs, are continuing to rise. In Nipaluna/Hobart, 39 per cent are out of reach for the average income for rental households. The average income is not JobSeeker or the pension. For Hobart, the average income is $91,000. That is more than some of our own staff are earning. Thirty nine per cent of rentals are out of reach and that is on the up. It has risen from 8 per cent just four years ago. Rent has also risen in most of the major suburbs, with rents becoming unaffordable in Brighton, Taroona, Huonville, Kingston, Old Beach, Bellerive, and Midway Point. In the region, 17 per cent of rentals are unaffordable, compared to 0 per cent four years ago.

As promised when they went to the election, the Liberals should be building more new social and affordable homes. To quote from the so-called Strong Plan, 'Quick facts: 10,000 new social and affordable homes by 2032'. We know in reality they are fudging the numbers. Instead of new homes, they are counting crisis accommodation, vacant blocks, rental assistance and affordable purchases towards targets. In a housing supply crisis, we need new homes, as promised.

We need to stop the bleeding. Whole home rentals are being converted to short-stay hotels and this needs to be reined in. Instead, together with Labor, the Liberals refuse to act. They have not even imposed the 5 per cent levy that was promised at the last election. Meanwhile, the CBOS data shows a 4.6 per cent increase in the number of whole homes listed as short-stay Airbnb in the most recent reporting period. There are 7630 short-stays in Tasmania, almost 50 per cent of which are whole homes that could be in the long-term rental market.

We have some of the weakest rental protection laws in the country, but yet again the Liberals have failed to take any significant action. Renters can be evicted unfairly, rents can be jacked up unreasonably and minimum standards are missing, impacting on quality of life and the size of power bills. 

On pets in rentals, it was great to see some progress recently with the rights of renters to have a pet in their home finally passing this House. Pets are part of the family, and renters should not have to choose between a roof over their head and their family pet. Let us not forget that this would never have happened without pressure from community advocates and the Greens. On behalf of the Greens [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=7.6_C=0.68] , I pass on my thanks and congratulations to the Tenants Union, Shelter Tas, the RSPCA, the Dogs' Home, Ten Lives Cat Centre and others. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=38.2_D=26.6_C=0.85]  Collectively, we finally forced the Liberals to commit to a policy before the last election to give renters the right to have a pet and thankfully that has come to pass. 
What was disappointing was the major parties once again teaming up to deny renters the right to make minor modifications to their homes. The pets bill had a section introducing a provision allowing tenants to fix toppling furniture, making homes safer. This opened the opportunity for broader amendments to improve tenants' lives. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=65.6_D=13.1_C=0.72]  Our amendments would have empowered tenants to make potentially life-changing modifications, including disability access, safety, security or telecommunications modifications like hand rails in showers, security cameras and safety screens. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=79.7_D=29.6_C=0.75]  Labor again sided with the Liberals to vote these down. 

Unlike them, we will not stop fighting to give renters real rights. That is why we have tabled a bill to end unfair no-cause evictions. Renters should not have to give up their homes without a fair, legitimate reason, but currently Tasmanians can be kicked out of their rentals for no other reason than their lease ending, so that rents can be jacked up or maintenance avoided. Often renters are too scared to ask for their mouldy carpet to be replaced or their dodgy heater to be serviced [Bookmark: Phr6_O=109.5_D=29.7_C=0.79]  in case their landlord kicks them out.

Our changes would bring this state into line with the Australian Capital Territory, South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria, which have all ended unfair no-cause evictions. Both the Tasmanian Liberals and federal Labor committed to ending no-cause evictions in the Better Deal for Renters, a policy state Labor echoed during the last election. We hope the major parties live up to their promises this time and support our move to give renters real rights by ending no-cause evictions.

The SPEAKER - I remind the member he was in breach of two Standing Orders during that speech. I hate having to have been grumpy  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=139.6_D=29.0_C=0.69] all day, but you were both reflecting on a vote of this House and anticipating an order of the day. I allowed it because it is the adjournment and flexibility is given, but please, can we just all read the Standing Orders to make my life a little easier? 

The House adjourned at 8.44 p.m.

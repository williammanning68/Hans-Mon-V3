STATEMENT BY SPEAKER

Microphone Etiquette

The SPEAKER - Before calling on Question Time today, I advise members that I reviewed the tape from last week's sitting and you were all very unruly. I caution members that if you sit too close to your microphones, Hansard cannot record the contribution of the actual speaker as well. It becomes very difficult for people to hear. If people continue to do that, we will have no option but to change the system and turn people's microphones off, other than the person who has the call. I would rather not do that because, in some cases, there is a bit of to-and-fro across the parliament that is quite acceptable. 

However, I caution members to be aware of that for the future because the tapes were pretty bad when we listened to them. It is becoming much more difficult for people who watch the broadcast to hear the speaker who has the call. 

With that lovely word of wisdom for the morning, I will call on Question Time.


QUESTIONS

Energy Assets - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.02 a.m.]
Last week, you finally admitted that your budget is in ruins, debt is out of control and you believe the only option is to sell Tasmania's future through asset sales. You have been premier for almost three full financial years, and they coincide with the three largest fiscal deficits in Tasmania's history by far. They are taking net debt from about $1 billion when you took over to $10 billion over the forward Estimates. The financial damage you have inflicted on Tasmania is staggering. Tasmanians will be paying it back for decades to come.

Your fire sale includes renewable energy assets Tasmania has invested in for 100 years, gone forever because you wrecked the budget. Can you provide one example of where privatisation of energy assets has worked anywhere in Australia?

Members interjecting. 

The SPEAKER - Order. The only person who has the call is the Premier.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. We have clearly said that when it comes to renewable energy assets, Hydro will always remain in government hands, first and foremost. 

Regarding other government assets, why would you not you have a sensible and measured approach to see what asset is best in government hands and what assets are best delivering for the Tasmanian community in private hands? I point, as the member mentioned, to the example of the Hobart airport, which the Labor government sold off in about 2007 or 2008. No one would question the benefit private ownership for the Hobart airport has delivered for Tasmanians.

Ms Brown - Are you saying you are selling off Tasmania's future knowing it will not work?

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Franklin, Ms Brown.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Upgrading the terminal, upgrading the runway in terms of length and pavement, which is positive, supported through government intervention, of course, but in private hands that airport has grown and is delivering for Tasmania and Tasmanians in an international airport that it is. In that context, why would you not have a sensible and measured conversation?

The issue for the member where he mentioned debt and some of the challenges that all state governments are going through, the difference is that we have a plan. We have a plan to reduce red tape and regulation - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - the right-sized State Service and reforming our GBEs. Your only plan is to rip profits to ensure that you maximise profits for the GBEs, but you can only mention - two things could happen as a result of that - 

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Sacking workers - 

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left. The Premier will address his comments - 

Mr WINTER - Point of order, honourable Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The question was: can the Premier name an example of where selling energy assets has worked anywhere in Australia? I wonder if you could bring him back to the question.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Mr Willie, interjecting on your leader as he makes his point of order is not particularly helpful. Members on my right will also be quiet. 
Premier, the question was specifically about renewable energy assets. The preamble was lengthy and, therefore, does get some commentary, but I will draw the Premier to the question for the last 20 seconds.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The principle I have outlined is the Hobart airport as a great example. I care about Tasmania and not what is happening in other states. I care about Tasmania and Tasmanians, and setting Tasmania up for a positive future, where we have halved the unemployment rate -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.  Interjections will cease. 

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Mr WINTER - Just to ask the question that was not answered: can the Premier provide one example of where privatisation of energy assets has worked anywhere in Australia? 

The SPEAKER - I will draw the Premier to the original question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - What I am focused on is Tasmania and looking across our GBEs where we can maximise the benefit for Tasmania and Tasmanians so we can continue growing our economy and continue to cut red tape and regulation for businesses, have the right-sized public service, but also maximise the opportunities through reforming our GBEs. That is a government with a plan, as opposed to maximising GBEs profits - 

Ms Dow - You wrecked the GBEs.

The SPEAKER - Order, Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Labor will hike up fees and charges, and you offer no solution. 

The SPEAKER - Premier, I will draw you to the question or you can feel free to resume your seat.

Mr ROCKLIFF - All scare, no solution. All venom, no vision, as well, which is the Labor Party playbook -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the supplementary question has expired. 

The Standing Orders Committee will be reviewing a number of the Sessional Orders, including supplementary questions. If they are not going to be treated respectfully, then the Standing Orders Committee can make its own decisions about the future of them. 


Energy Assets - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF 

[10.08 a.m.]
Last week, I asked you to name one example of where privatisation of energy assets had worked and you could not. Today I asked you the same question and you still could not answer the question. 

In Victoria, privatisation saw power prices increase by 170 per cent and more than 10,000 workers lost their jobs. In South Australia, prices also soared and blackouts increased by more than 30 per cent. Is the reason you cannot provide a single example of where privatising energy assets has been successful because, in fact, it has not worked anywhere?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. I am interested in the correlation, particularly when you mentioned 10,000 workers - if my memory serves me correctly, that was the number of workers who lost their jobs under the Labor-Greens government, in fact.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left, do not bite when he distracts you.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You are the mob that put up Aurora for sale.

Mr Ferguson - That is right. You could not even sell it.

The SPEAKER - Order, Mr Ferguson, member for Bass.

Mr ROCKLIFF - As has been backed in by the TCCI (Tasmanian Chamber of Industry and Commerce), I have had a very measured and sensible conversation of how best to utilise our government assets, whether that be delivering services when it comes to government ownership or service delivery out of government ownership and those funds then in a future fund for Tasmania's future. That is absolutely crucial.

What we are about is ensuring that we are growing the economy, supporting small, medium and large businesses. With your performance over recent months, I wonder what you have got against business. 

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - What have you got against business, creating an environment where they can grow?
Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I will tell you a good example where we work through real challenges and find solutions to grow the economy. There is no better example than the King Island Dairy. 

Government members - Hear, hear.

Mr ROCKLIFF - When we were out there looking for a buyer, you were out there calling for a boycott on their products.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Shame on you.

Members interjecting.

Ms DOW - A point of order, honourable Speaker. The Premier is not being truthful in this place, and I ask him to withdraw that comment.

Mr Ellis - That is true. Josh Willie on Hansard.

The SPEAKER - Order. I do not need minister Ellis to make a ruling for me. Get elected to the Chair and you can do all the ruling you would like.

I remind members that the Standing Orders do require them to, at all times, be truthful in this House, and if they inadvertently mislead, to correct as soon as possible. It is arguable that this is a debating point about what was said, but I will hear the Premier's answer from now. I note the point of order from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I ask all members to behave honestly and truthfully in this place. I also ask you all to obey the Standing Orders. With that, Premier, I ask you to direct your response through the Chair.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, honourable Speaker. I was of a mind to purchase some cheese for the Labor Party yesterday when I went to the King Island Dairy shop, but we had Labor members over there calling for a boycott of the cheese, so I thought against that.

Mr WINTER - Honourable Speaker, Standing Order 2. The Premier must be accurate. He has just said that we were over there calling for a boycott of King Island Dairy. That is not true. He knows it is not true. He should withdraw it straight away.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my right will cease trying to be helpful, as will Mr Willie.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I am sorry, Premier, you do not have the call. Your time has expired. I am not going to have this to-and-fro across the Chamber. This is a place where people are expecting us to behave appropriately; asking questions, receiving answers. There is a note for both of you in that.


Salmon Industry - Fish Deaths and Pollution

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.12 a.m.]
We are in the largest ever mass salmon mortality, which is in no way over. Over the baking long weekend, locals flocked to southern Huon and Channel beaches to swim, but the sparkling water was murky and filled with salmon fat and oil. No one was swimming and no kids were building sandcastles. This is the reality of the salmon industry: stinking, lifeless waters, diseased, rotting fish, animal cruelty and thousands of tonnes of dead fish being dumped, some of it illegally.

Last week in parliament, you claimed big salmon was on notice. Tough talk. It is the government's job to regulate the salmon industry, so it is you, Premier, who is on notice. What are you going to do to clean up the salmon mess? Are you still backing the big salmon corporates who are trashing our beaches and waterways?

The SPEAKER - Before calling the Premier, can everybody just take this time to check that your phones are on silent or off please?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. I also thank the member for Braddon, Mr Garland, for raising this issue ahead of the Greens last week, in a very sensible way. We acknowledge the community concerns about this matter. The community is concerned. We also acknowledge the very challenging situation that the companies themselves face. I want to personalise that by the many hundreds of workers who are feeling the effects of this and the distress of the mortality and the endemic Piscirickettsia of which is the cause, as I understand it, or largely due to the salmon mortality event.

We have an independent regulatory authority and implied in your question, we want to ensure that the regulators have everything and all the information at their disposal to ensure that they can do their job and regulate the industry. That is why we set up that independent EPA (Environment Protection Authority) to govern the regulations of the salmon industry, which was a very sensible thing to do. The opportunity presented itself between 2010 and 2014 to set up a robust regulatory regime of the salmon industry and unfortunately, the Greens did not manage to do that. It took a Liberal government to really bring the independence of the EPA to the fore in these critical issues.

From an environmental perspective, the critical issue is the timely collection and management of fish residue in an approved manner, which you referred to in your question, Dr Woodruff. These incidents, I am advised, are typically elevated during the warmer summer months, as you would appreciate, when warmer waters and other factors affecting salmon health are more likely to occur. Reports over recent months suggest widespread availability of nutrients along the east and south-east coast of Tasmania brought in by the east Australian current. I outlined some of these matters last week. Some algae, jellyfish and other marine organisms are a known irritant of salmon gills and may lead to increased mortality as well, I am advised.

The marine heat wave conditions have occurred in waters immediately east of Tasmania over the past few months and contribute to an inter-annual variability of Storm Bay in particular. We are proudly a supporter of the industry for the product that is in -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - The Premier did not identify a single new action that he was going to take to clean up this disaster. His response made it sound as though he thinks this is a normal summer event. Can you, Premier, tell us and the communities, what actions you will take to change the way salmon industries are being regulated in Tasmania and this mess is being fixed up?

The SPEAKER - The Premier seems to be happy to answer that question, but I was going to suggest that it probably is a new question. Your question originally was 'What will you do to clean up the mess?' and the Premier has identified that the EPA has that role. I will take a further question from you on this matter if you would like, but I do not think the supplementary applies.

Dr WOODRUFF - Thank you, Speaker. It was about what he was going to do to clean up the mess. The EPA has been there for 10 years -

The SPEAKER - I wrote the question down, Leader of the Greens, as you asked it. I am in a difficult position in the way that supplementary questions are run in this Chamber, in that I have to make determinations on whether I think the question was answered. I do believe that the question was answered, maybe not the way you wanted it to be, but I am sure that you do have an opportunity for three more questions today.


Housing Connect Reform Project - Online Portal

Mr O'BYRNE question to MINISTER for HOUSING and PLANNING, Mr ELLIS

[10.17 a.m.]
When your government first announced the Housing Connect reform project in 2019, you made a commitment to vulnerable Tasmanians that the accessibility and approachability of housing services would be improved. There were major concerns within the sector about these reforms, leading to highly respected organisation Colony 47, now Home Base, feeling like they had no choice but to walk away from providing these services.

A fundamental component of Housing Connect 2.0 was the online portal, initially promised for implementation in 2023 before being delayed until July 2024. It is now March 2025 and there is no sign of the online portal. Not only is this negatively impacting Tasmanians accessing housing support, but it is also having a detrimental impact on housing service providers. How can you justify endless delays to this important housing reform? When will it be delivered?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. It is important that we are delivering good customer service for Tasmanians doing it tough and that is what our Housing Connect reforms have been about. It is an exciting new phase of the journey. Housing Connect 2.0 officially commenced on 1 July 2024 following a significant reform project to improve services for Tasmanians seeking housing assistance.

That included rolling out that model statewide so that wherever you live, you can get the best possible service from those looking to provide housing. Key changes to the housing service model was the introduction of that statewide front door with connection coaches, who provide integrated support to people with low and moderate support needs. The new Housing Connect service model provides personalised support tailored to people's individual circumstances and life stages, because we know that not everyone's needs are the same, with specialist intensive support for young people, single people, couples, families and older people depending on their age and stage.

Homes Tasmania is continuing to deliver improvements to Housing Connect, including a new website that will provide access to information and services. It will support self-direction, which is a key part of what we have been hearing from people - that where they have the capability, they would love to be able to take the lead on that service for themselves and to enable Tasmanians to apply for housing assistance online. 

The new Housing Connect client information platform has been co-designed with our workers and is on track for delivery, I can inform the House, on 31 March of this year with the new website. That is in a couple of weeks' time. We are really looking forward to rolling that service out. I think that was at the nub of your question. The platform will be integrated with the Housing Connect website and provide a more efficient system for workers and improved data collection and reporting.

Supplementary Question

Mr O'BYRNE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr O'BYRNE - This is a really important reform that your government announced. Colony 47 and Home Base walked away because of their concerns, and now people in the sector are saying a key component of the reform - an online portal, not the website; an online portal which manages cases as they come in - is not being delivered. It has been delayed by over 12 months. When is it going to be implemented? 

The SPEAKER - I will accept the supplementary as it was the original question. 

Mr ELLIS - Thank you, Speaker. Unless there has been something lost in translation, as I said, it is on track for commencement on 31 March, so in a couple of weeks' time. 


Salmon Industry - Stocking Density

Mr BAYLEY question to MINISTER for the ENVIRONMENT, Ms OGILVIE 

[10.21 a.m.]
It has been a catastrophic summer for our south-east waters, with over 1 million salmon perishing in industrial fish farms and parts of them washing up on local beaches. The public are rightly appalled. Salmon mortality events are not unprecedented, as claimed by an industry in damage control. After the Liberals took office in 2014, fish stock density in Macquarie Harbour was massively increased, and in 2018, warming waters and an endemic virus wreaked havoc, with the death of 1.35 million fish.

Can you confirm that a stocking density increase was approved for the Huon Aquaculture lease south of Zuidpool Rock leading into the current summer? If so, by how much? More broadly, did any other leases have stocking density increases and if so, which were they and by how much were they increased?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. It is good to have a question on this very important issue. As the Environment minister, obviously I am responsible, broadly speaking, for the EPA. The EPA is conducting an investigation as we speak. It would be important, in my view, for us all to take care until we see the results of that investigation. As Environment minister, I want to be, hope to be and try to be driven by science, data and facts. That is what we are seeking to get with the investigation.

I acknowledge the deep concern about this issue, not just in our community but also for the workforce. I know it has been really difficult for people working in the sector - good people who really care about their jobs and care about animal welfare. Our hearts go out to those down the Huon. I acknowledge that this has been a hugely challenging situation that salmon companies have been dealing with. The high number of fish losses has been quite difficult for everybody to cope with, and it has been occurring within a very short period of time.

I will say that fish deaths are a known aspect of salmon farming worldwide. The current salmon mortality event is largely due to an endemic bacterium which we know does not grow in humans and does not present an animal or animal health or food safety risk.

Mr Bayley - Minister, the question was about the leases and the stocking.

The SPEAKER - You may take a point of order if you wish, Deputy Leader, but do not interject.

Ms OGILVIE - I have not finished answering. I will get to it. In relation to the question of fish densities, that sits with the leases and the legislation that sits under minister Abetz. I am sure he can provide you with some more information. My understanding is that our fish densities, which are set, are lower than some globally. I think minister Abetz would be able to facilitate some more responses in relation to that.

I would also like to say that what has been happening is that the elevated incidents we have seen this summer relate to warmer waters and other factors. We are really aware of that, and salmon health issues are connected to that as well. Marine heat wave conditions which have occurred in waters immediately east of Tasmania over the past two summers, and contribute to inter-annual variability in Storm Bay in particular, have been of concern.

As we have all been saying, and we will continue to say, we are very strong supporters of the salmon industry, particularly the workforce, as we should be. We will continue to support it and expect openness and transparency. As the Minister for the Environment with an EPA investigation underway, I am very much looking forward to hearing the results of that report.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr BAYLEY - I think the minister confirmed that the stocking densities are not set by the EPA, but are set by the department, if I heard her correctly. The question is whether she can work with minister Abetz to update the House on notice on these specific questions about whether an increase in stocking density south of Zuidpool Rock was made in the lead-up to summer, and if there were any other stocking densities increased. Are you happy to take that on notice, minister? 

Ms Ogilvie - Sure, I will.

Mr BAYLEY - Thank you.

The SPEAKER - I am happy that the minister has said that she will take it on notice and I note that, but your question should have been a new question to the minister responsible for that area. The minister has said she is happy to make sure that happens and that is the case. Minister, you could have also referred to that question to the appropriate minister during the time of the question, and that is something I would encourage members to do rather than using their time.


Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation - Dividends

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.26 a.m.]
Over the last 10 years, our government businesses have returned more than $4 billion in dividends and other payments to help fund our schools, hospitals and emergency services. Over the next three years they are set to provide another $1.4 billion. How will you fund our schools, hospitals and emergency services if you sell the businesses that help to fund them? Is not your plan to sell Tasmania's future just going to make our budget situation worse?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I stand to be corrected, but I believe it will be largely Hydro contained in those figures. Is that right?

Mr Winter - It is a mixture of all the GBEs.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Largely Hydro.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Stop misleading the community by what you are doing.

The SPEAKER - The Premier cannot ask a question to the opposition, nor should they respond.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Stop misleading to mask your lack of plan for Tasmania. When I think back at all the Labor heroes who did have a privatisation agenda -

Mr Winter - They built Hydro.

Mr ROCKLIFF - For example, Bob Hawke, Paul Keating, Jim Bacon - all Labor heroes.

Mr Winter - You think they were great because they sold things?

The SPEAKER - Order, Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ROCKLIFF - All Labor heroes. Michael Aird -

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Even the Labor Party are laughing at their former adviser being a great Labor hero. However, it did strike me when I was presented the 2007-08 Budget speech, Delivering our Plan and Shaping the Future, where there was quite a reference to asset sales, Mr Winter - 

Mr Winter - It is 2025, Premier.

Mr ROCKLIFF - particularly the Hobart airport, got a mention as well. 'Reinvesting in our future' was the headline. I know you are embarrassed about -

Mr WINTER - Honourable Speaker, point of order, Standing Order 45, relevance -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. First of all, the member is allowed to take a point of order, so we will not have that chorus response again. I will hear the point of order.

Mr WINTER - Sorry to disrupt the Premier from going through his papers, but the question was about 2025 and the future. Can the Premier outline how the budget is going to be improved by selling assets when he is so reliant on the dividends coming from the businesses he is trying to sell?

Mr Ellis - All your questions have been about the past and other places. 

The SPEAKER - Order, minister Ellis, you can stop helping now. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Well -

Ms Dow - He wants your job.

The SPEAKER - Order, Deputy Leader of the Opposition. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - The original question referenced a figure which largely contained that of Hydro dividends, if my information is correct. Stop trying to mislead Tasmanians and this parliament with your scare campaign.

In Mr Aird's speech back then, Reinvesting in our Future, he says:

The government has made decisions to sell three non-core government-owned businesses, one of those, the Hobart International Airport. 

He goes on:

We have considered this advice and believe it is vital that we give these businesses every opportunity to achieve a sustainable future in the private sector.

Back then, there was a measured approach to these circumstances by the Labor Party -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time to answer the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - Can the Premier explain how Tasmania's budget situation will be improved by selling the assets which are contributing revenue that helps pay for schools and hospitals?

The SPEAKER - I will call the Premier, but I believe the answer he is giving is that Hydro pays for them all by themselves almost. Premier, I will call you to the question if you can add to it, but I believe that is the answer you gave.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It is a large part of my answer because my information is that is correct. You are scaring Tasmanians - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members for Clark on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - and refusing to engage in a sensible debate when it comes to delivering services for Tasmania - 

Mr Winter - Are you saying MAIB does not deliver dividends?

Mr ROCKLIFF - either GBEs in government hands or GBEs in the private sector, of which a great example is the Hobart International Airport, which went from government hands to private hands, and look at the growth of the international airport.

Mr Aird goes on to say:

It is now an appropriate time for the government to sell the Hobart airport to enable reinvestment of those resources into new infrastructure.

We are reinvesting into a future fund -

Members interjecting. 

The SPEAKER - Order, Leader of Opposition Business and member for Bass.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Some of it has not aged all that well.

Ms Haddad - You are using it to block up a black hole of debt.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Clark.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Some of the commitments have not aged all that well -

Dr Broad - It was not to pay the credit card.

The SPEAKER - Order, Leader of Opposition Business, I just called you.

Mr ROCKLIFF - 

The new infrastructure projects will include the development of Macquarie Point as a site for the new Royal Hobart Hospital. 

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Mr ROCKLIFF - That did not age so well.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. You will resume your seat.


Budget - Eslake Report Transparency Recommendations

Ms JOHNSTON question to TREASURER, Mr BARNETT

[10.32 a.m.]
You have cherrypicked from Saul Eslake's report and ignored his important recommendations for transparency and greater budget responsibility. Within 30 days of the Budget or revised Estimates report, will you detail to parliament the actions you will take to fix things when they show your government is not going to meet its fiscal targets? Will you detail what actions you will take in the following 12 months to meet the targets to get things back on track over the forward Estimates period? Will you commit to urgently establishing a parliamentary budget office to allow proper parliamentary scrutiny of your government's budget performance?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. The Budget will be delivered on 29 May. I am looking forward to delivering the Budget because it will be entirely consistent with the government's plan to grow the economy, back industry and business, and create more jobs. It will include the important reforms the Premier has announced in the recent week or so in terms of reducing red tape and regulation. Mr Abetz has more to say about that today. 

We have an agenda. We want to right-size our public service. We believe it is important to get to the right size. You have made mention of Saul Eslake and the fiscal strategy. Of course, getting that right size is part of our fiscal strategy. Reference was made to it in the budget last year. I acknowledge the former treasurer for that budget and the importance of including those in the figures. The revised Estimates report also included reference to the right size for our public service.

A key reform in recent weeks, recent months, has been the reform of our government business enterprises. We have put our shoulder to the wheel, working side by-side with business and industry, getting their thoughts and feedback, as well as getting the thoughts and feedback of community groups, unions and others. There were 48 submissions on the discussion paper released at the end of last year by the Premier and me. We appreciate the engagement, working with them. 

I appreciate the endorsement of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI) for our reforms, specifically for the Premier's announcement on Friday about a one-stop shop for small business to get the job done, being a start-up capital for Australia. The TCCI CEO said it was a world first, as far as he was aware. That is good news. How about saying, 'Well done, good news there'?

Likewise, with respect to King Island, why is the opposition not saying, 'Congratulations, well done to the Premier, with King Island Dairy back in Australian hands'?

With respect to the end of your question, you asked about a parliamentary budget office. We have to get the balance right in terms of priorities. That is not expected to be in the Budget, but I will have more to say at Budget time and in the days and weeks following the Budget. I appreciate your question and your interest in this important matter.

Supplementary Question

Ms JOHNSTON - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms JOHNSTON - At the end of the question, the Treasurer indicated he needs to get the priorities right. Is the Treasurer suggesting that parliamentary scrutiny of his budget performance is not a right priority that this parliament and this government should be focused on?

The SPEAKER - It does arise out of the answer the Treasurer gave. I did think you were going to go to the first two parts of the question, but as you did not, I will only call you to the supplementary question.

Mr BARNETT - Thank you for the question in terms of the priorities for our government. They are very clear. We have a plan. We are backing industry and business, creating jobs. Of course, the other side have nothing but relentless negativity.

Ms JOHNSTON - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. Is the priority budget scrutiny and parliamentary scrutiny? It is a simple yes or no.

The SPEAKER - The supplementary question was exactly on that. I will call the Treasurer to it. You have 32 seconds left.

Mr BARNETT - Of course, government scrutiny is a priority. This is what we are on about in terms of openness and transparency. This is a key priority of our government. It will remain so. We hope all members of this parliament will scrutinise the budget and acknowledge the fact that we have a plan. If you want to apologise for not having a plan, state Labor being all sooking and no substance, that is a matter for you.

Motor Accidents Insurance Board - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.37 a.m.]
Over the last 10 years, MAIB (Motor Accidents and Insurance Board) has provided nearly $1 billion in dividends and other returns that have helped fund our schools, hospitals and emergency services. On top of that, they fund the Road Safety Advisory Council, the Injury Prevention and Management Foundation and the SES road rescue services in the regions. They also sponsor brain and spinal injury charities, road trauma support services and other educational programs. Where will you find the money for all of these critical programs, not to mention our schools and hospitals, if you sell MAIB?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. When we look at all the opportunity of government ownership in GBEs or not, what is at the forefront of our minds is the importance of maximising the service delivery for Tasmanians. We are having a very sensible look across our GBEs. We may well, as I said last week, only sell and put into a future fund two or three.

Mr Winter - Only two or three?

Mr ROCKLIFF - That is what I said last week. Why would we have a look at all of those opportunities? Should we sell and put the investments into a future fund, organisations such as MAIB, of course, there would be built in consumer protection to ensure that the insurance does its job for Tasmanians in terms of charges and fees and other matters as well.

What we are very certain about is that when you squeeze all that money out of MAIB in terms of maximising their profits, you will either have to increase fees and charges or sack people. I suspect what you are going to do, as Labor always does, is turn up the wick to ensure maximum pain on Tasmanians. The difference between this side of the House and that side of the House is that we have a plan and you do not have a plan. You are having a scare campaign that is all scare, no substance, all venom and no vision, as is the Labor Party playbook in recent years. At least, back in the Michael Aird treasurer days, there was some substance and good reason to offload public assets such as the Hobart airport, for example. You are going around running a huge scare campaign.

You mentioned a figure before in your previous answer, and I hope and I expect you will be scrutinised on this when you head out on parliament lawns today. Regarding the dividends, if you take out the Mersey Community Hospital dividend from the Tasmanian Public Finance Corporation (TASCORP), take out the Hydro dividend, take out the Hydro tax and take out the Hydro rate, it leaves you in the 2023-24 Budget with $131.7 million, in the prelim $121.5 million; $127.8 million in 2024-25; and $146.9 million in 2025-26; as an example.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - Coming from the answer the Premier just provided with hundreds of millions of dollars of dividends going back to the Tasmanian budget, can he explain where the money will come from after he has sold those assets that are delivering the dividends back to our budget?

The SPEAKER - Premier, I will draw you to the question as it arises from the answer which was the original question.
Mr ROCKLIFF - In my previous answer, I was clearly pointing out that you are trying to pull the wool over Tasmanian's eyes and it is irresponsible. If you want to be the leader of a government, you have to start demonstrating that you have a plan because in the absence of a plan, you cannot be taken seriously.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You have been found out already this morning by scaring people.

The SPEAKER - Premier, I draw you to the supplementary question, please.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We have a plan. Those opposite wanted to spend three times as much as we committed to at the last election.

Mr Winter - That is absolute garbage.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You complain about debt - it is there in black and white.

Members interjecting.

Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.43 a.m.]
Over the last 10 years, TasNetworks has provided nearly half a billion dollars in dividends and hundreds of millions of dollars more in other returns and provided critical equity support to Hydro, TasRail and Sustainable Timber Tasmania (STT). These have helped fund our schools, hospitals and emergency services and kept other key areas of our economy afloat. On top of that, TasNetworks is critical in connecting Marinus with North West Transmission Network and proposed new developments. Is all this funding for schools and hospitals or the broader economic support and all the infrastructure investment not at risk under your plan to privatise and sell the poles and wires that Tasmanians built?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. Your plan is to inflict pain in a cost-of-living crisis on Tasmanians, and that is what you will do. You will rack up fees and charges of GBEs to maximise profits, jacking up charges and fees, which is taking dollars straight out of the pockets of Tasmanians in a cost-of-living crisis; a nationwide, if not global cost-of-living crisis. We are the ones with a sensible plan to grow the economy, to cut red tape and regulations to right size our state service and reform our GBEs.

We have a plan to grow the economy because we have seen the benefits of a growing economy, and the benefits of a growing economy are, in actual fact, some of the issues that you have mentioned - better schools, better hospitals, more teachers, more nurses and more police on the beat. Therefore a range of frontline services have been improved under this government, which no one can deny. 

When we came to government we inherited very poor budget circumstances -

Members interjecting.

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 2. The Premier cannot stand up and make things up. This Premier inherited $200 million in net cash and investments from the previous government. He has blown the budget to $10 billion worth of debt. He should not say that.

The SPEAKER - It is not a time on a point of order to make an argument. It is now on the record and you have said that. I remind all members that they need to be honest and truthful in their approaches and if they discover that they have inadvertently misled, I expect them to come back to the Chamber and immediately correct it. 

I also remind members that when I am speaking, even more so than the times when you should not interject, that is even worse, Mr Willie. 

The Premier has the call. You have one minute to come to the question, please, and I will ask you to direct it through me. It does make it a little less confrontational and might keep the House a bit calmer.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you for your wise counsel, honourable Speaker. I take it in the previous point of order that the member is proud of the fact that when Labor were last in power with the Greens, 10 000 jobs were lost. Unemployment was 8.6 per cent. You talk about power prices. They went up 65 per cent under you lot and what we have now is the lowest regulated power prices in the nation.

The SPEAKER - To the question, Premier.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We are still reaching in with renewable energy dividends, which would not be part of your plan, clearly, as the member indicated the other day, to support Tasmania with crediting their power bills.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - A not unexpected supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - The question was: is all this funding for schools and hospitals, all the broader economic support and all the infrastructure investment not at risk under your plan to privatise our renewable energy assets? 

The SPEAKER - I will draw the Premier to the original question.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - No, there was a point of order. Trust me, it is a lot for me to keep track of as well, Premier, but you do have the call for the supplementary question, and I will ask you to address the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - A couple of things to correct the Leader of the Opposition on there. The Tasmanian economy will always be better served under a Liberal government.

Ms Brown - Rubbish, $10 billion of net debt.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Franklin.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We did not inherit no debt. The 2013-2014 budget paper makes it clear. It is estimated that net debt -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Franklin, I just called you, you are warned.

Mr ROCKLIFF - will be $226.1 million on 30 June 2014 - 

Mr Winter - What was net debt on 30 June 2014?

Mr ROCKLIFF - and increase in 2015. When it comes to our fiscal strategy, of which -

Mr Winter - You are in breach of pretty much the entire thing. 

The SPEAKER - Order, Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You breached not only your own Hydro policy, because you changed it within 24 hours, but Dr Broad was sitting at all these media advisories having to correct the record of his own fiscal strategy.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering that question has expired. 


Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF 

[10.48 a.m.]
You have destroyed Tasmania's budget. Tasmanian government businesses are strategic assets that underpin the state's economy and government revenues more generally. For over 100 years Tasmania has invested in our renewable energy assets to create safe, secure and well-paid jobs in industry like the Zinc Works in Hobart, the paper mill at Boyer, and TEMCO and Bell Bay Aluminium up at Bell Bay. 

Public ownership of TT-Line kickstarted two decades of growth in our tourism industry and across our primary producers. Public ownership of Tasmanian Irrigation got schemes started across the state and made our state the food bowl of the nation. Manufacturing, tourism and agriculture are all key industries in Tasmania and they are underpinned by investment by publicly owned businesses. 

Does not your privatisation plan put all of that at risk?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. All you want to do is jack up fees and charges for Tasmanians and squeeze that out of GBEs. What we want with our plan is economic growth so we can keep employing many thousands of Tasmanians - encourage the private sector to employ many thousands of Tasmanians by slashing red tape and regulations to make it easier to do business in Tasmania -

Dr Woodruff - Ugh.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You can go to sleep in another ten minutes if you like; Question Time will be finished.

Dr Woodruff - The trickle-down effect does not work. I cannot believe we are still hearing this.

The SPEAKER - Premier, I will call you to the question. Those interjections will cease.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It sounded like you were not engaged. 

Dr Woodruff - I am not engaged with your narrative, no.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, the Premier has the call and will address the question. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - You do not have a plan. You have a scare campaign and a scare plan for Tasmanians and for a lack of substance. All scare, full of venom and no vision. You come in here talking about unsustainable budgets and debt when you advocated in your election commitment to spend three times as much as us. 

When we supported Tasmanians through COVID and the pandemic you largely supported that investment, although often you probably wanted more investment, which would have us in an even more unsustainable position with what you are talking about now. We have had to reach in and support Tasmanians through that difficult time. Now is the time to have a sensible look at right-sizing our public service, and have a sensible and measured look about which government businesses we should be owning and which we can divest and put into a future fund. It is all about better service delivery for Tasmanians, and ensuring that GBEs are delivering good services for Tasmanians at the lowest possible cost. 

What you are about is racking up fees and charges and inflicting pain on Tasmanians who are already suffering under a cost-of-living crisis. If that is not your plan, then say so, because we all know across the state and across this country how challenging it is for state governments in particular, and many of them Labor governments, to find a post-pandemic budget surplus. However, we have a plan for that and you do not. The Tasmanian people rightly expect you to offer a plan and a solution for -

Salmon Industry - Mass Mortality Crisis - Storm Bay Leases

Ms BADGER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF 

[10.53 a.m.]
Our beaches across southern Tasmania are presently unusable and the EPA is deliberately ill-equipped to rein in the salmon farming industry or hold them adequately accountable, yet expansion is still planned for Storm Bay. This is rightfully concerning for the community and I acknowledge those community members who are here with us today. 

Last week you claimed the salmon industry is 'on notice'. It is time to put your money where your mouth is. Given the massive industry failures, the loss of amenity, harm to the marine environment and gross animal cruelty, will you scrap the planned Storm Bay leases?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. I acknowledge the community concern, acknowledging that some members of the community, and particularly the Greens, have never liked the salmon industry and have always wanted to shut it down, along with it sending many thousands of people to the dole queues, which we will not have.

I take issue with the member's question, which, if I paraphrase it from memory, criticised the independent EPA for deliberately not doing their job effectively.

Members interjecting.

Dr Woodruff - You wrote the legislation.

The SPEAKER - Order, Leader of the Greens.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I take issue with that because I have a lot of confidence in the EPA to do their job. We set up the EPA to do their job independently from government.

As I have said a few times in the Chamber, the reforms we made over the last decade have put greater accountability and greater transparency on the salmon industry in terms of monitoring, in terms of marine debris compliance and in terms of separation of the EPA from the Department of Primary Industries and Water. If I can paint that picture, it is now NRE Tas (Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania), the government responsible and the department responsible who, in your regime of the Labor-Greens government, we had the Department of Primary Industries both supporting the growth of the sector but also regulating and monitoring as well.

Ms BADGER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. We are talking about the expansion and Storm Bay leases. The question is not about the EPA.

The SPEAKER - The preamble to your question certainly referenced the EPA and your issues and concerns there, but the actual question was specifically about Storm Bay. With less than a minute to go, I will draw the Premier to that part of it.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The salmon industry has plans for expansion, as we know, back into deeper waters off the coast. The inland waters have been some challenge.

Dr Woodruff interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You are laughing again. Okay.

Dr Woodruff - Well, it is not where they are going.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We support measured growth in the industry. There is enormous rigour around that growth and enormous community consultation as well.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.


Bridgewater Bridge - Employment of Interstate Workers

Mr JENNER question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE, Mr VINCENT, answered by PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.57 a.m.]
The Bridgewater bridge has been one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects undertaken by this government. We know that the project directly and indirectly employed many people. How many of those who were directly employed came from interstate?

The SPEAKER - I believe in the absence of the Minister for Infrastructure the Premier will take those questions. I remind you that the members who sit behind you leave on upper House sitting days at five to the hour. If you wish to direct a question directly to the minister, it would be worth being conscious of that time on those weeks. Otherwise, the Premier answers questions on behalf of the Minister for Infrastructure.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. It is a huge project approaching some $800 million of investment - the bridge and also the associated infrastructure at either end of the bridge as well, which is very exciting.

I am very proud of that project. I am proud on behalf of our government that got the project up and running. I am thankful for federal government support of both political persuasions. It has been a very good team project. It was fantastic to see the other day that last segment go in and I look forward to cars crossing that bridge. That is a project that really symbolises this government getting things done. I mentioned Michael Aird's speech in 2007 and 2008 where he referenced the new Royal Hobart Hospital on Macquarie Point. That was in 2007 and 2008.

Mr Willie - How many plans have you had for Macquarie Point? Eleven years and it is still a wasteland.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order. Mr Willie, you cannot scream across the Chamber particularly when I am attempting to hear the member for Lyons. You are warned, Mr Willie. Mr Jenner, you have a point of order?

Mr JENNER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. I asked how many were directly employed from interstate? That was the only question. I made it short so it would not get too much leeway.

The SPEAKER - I will just hold the clock for a second. The member quite rightly points out that his question was quite specific. It did not contain a large preamble and as such, I draw the Premier to the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - There is some detail in that question. I will need to make a reasonable attempt at providing that on notice to you, Mr Jenner. 

Notwithstanding that, yes, there would be some interstate employees, which we welcome to Tasmania. They get to experience Tasmanian life, they fall in love with Tasmania and hopefully they move to Tasmania. We have other infrastructure projects coming online as well. They also live here and spend money here and that helps local retail and growth in our economy. It is why our retail figures are probably as good as they are and it is probably why our economy is leading the nation when it comes to that growth as well.

I understand the reason behind your question. I will provide some detail for you at a later time.

The SPEAKER - I note that that question has been taken on notice. 


Hawthorn Football Club Relationship

Mrs PENTLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

11.00 a.m.
Tasmania's partnership with Hawthorn Football Club has been an undeniable success. It is estimated the return on investment has been five to one, with the northern economy benefiting significantly during the winter months. While Hawthorn is interested in extending the deal beyond 2027, the Devil's CEO has made it clear he would prefer the agreement ends.
Premier, given we are spending $130 million upgrading the UTAS Stadium, do you agree that we should be striving for more than four AFL matches at that ground each year?

Are you supportive of an ongoing relationship with the Hawks?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank Mrs Pentland for the question. We really value the relationship with Hawthorn. It has been over two decades strong and I have often said in various forums what good corporate citizens the Hawthorn Football Club are, and I appreciate that. That is why I texted Andrew Gowers after the game the other day. I tipped the Hawks and it was a very successful opening round for the Hawks. I also texted Ashley Klein, the CEO, as well. I liked the away jersey; I thought it was fantastic. There was a bit of controversy, but I did say to them that I thought the away jersey was very good, as is their contribution to Tasmania.

I would like to see Hawthorn engaged in games in Tasmania beyond the timeframe as you outlined and that will require further discussion. I know the Hawks love playing here - the players do - and that is a good thing. It is a huge economic boost to Launceston and you can walk through the streets of Launceston on a footy day and know that the footy is on which is fantastic, which is why the partnership has been so beneficial and enduring.

We will get the same feel right throughout Tasmania when it comes to the Tasmanian Devils as well, when they play in Launceston. I reckon that the Tassie Devils and the Hawks will be an absolute blockbuster at York Park, given that there are 10,000 Tasmanian Hawthorn members - if my memory serves me correctly - which is fantastic.

The point of your question is a very good one regarding the economic benefit of maximising the number of games in northern Tasmania. Of course, in that 2028 year, I am hoping that there are a lot of games in northern Tasmania in the absence of the stadium being completed. I speak of the Tassie Devils as well.

It has been a great relationship. They are good corporate citizens. They are in our schools. The Premier's Reading Challenge has been going over successive premiers for some time, which is fantastic as a former minister for education, and anything we can do to continue maximising that we will do.

Securing more games for Hawthorn beyond the contractual arrangements, despite what the CEO might prefer, will be welcome as well. Thank you for raising it with me.


Salmon Industry - Huon Aquaculture - Animal Cruelty Charges

Dr WOODRUFF question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Ms HOWLETT

[11.04 a.m.]
You are overseeing the biggest biosecurity and animal welfare catastrophe in the state's modern history. Not only are the Premier, your department and the EPA continuing to hide facts about this mass mortality event, you have also personally failed to respond to the grotesque animal cruelty that people worldwide saw last week: live salmon flipping desperately, being dumped into tubs full of other dead fish and being suffocated and entombed. The footage Bob Brown Foundation captured of a worker doing this on behalf of the company led to the RSPCA suspending its certification of Huon. We hope the suspension becomes permanent. It was a clear breach of the cruelty provisions in the Animal Welfare Act. 

Minister, do you have the courage to take this industry on? Can you confirm cruelty charges will be laid under the act? If not, why not?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. The Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania (NRE Tas) is aware of the footage. Biosecurity Tasmania is investigating the matter in accordance with existing process for handling animal welfare complaints. It is important to let that investigation take its course and will be guided by the report's findings. I understand that the company is also conducting its own investigation into this matter.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - Thank you, minister. Investigation is underway. When do you anticipate it will be completed? Will you expect to be keeping the public fully informed about the process? 

The SPEAKER - Minister, the question does arise from the answer that you gave about there being an investigation.

Ms HOWLETT - As I mentioned, the investigation is under process. It is being undertaken by the Department of NRE Tas. I will let the department look at that investigation. I am not going to pre-empt when that investigation will be finalised. Of course, when the investigation is finalised, it will be made public.


Mother-Baby Unit - Southern Tasmania

Ms HADDAD question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF, referred to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

[11.07 a.m.]
When St Helens Private Hospital closed the mother-baby unit in Hobart, you promised to provide a state-based alternative. As you know, the mother-baby units around the country assist families in their greatest hour of need, providing a vital support to the mental health of mothers adjusting to motherhood. They provided a residential 24-hour, seven-day-a-week support model of care and there are countless testimonials from mothers who say that their stay at the mother-baby unit saved their life.

The two beds at the Royal Hobart Hospital, while a welcome stopgap, are not able to meet demand or provide a true mother-baby unit model of care. Is it true that the recently announced new beds to be provided at St John's Park will now be scrapped and will in fact only operate Monday to Friday, 9.00 a.m. to 5.00 p.m. and provide support only with settling and sleeping? If so, will you recognise that this is not a mother-baby unit model of care and is in fact a massive broken promise by you?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the very good question. I will refer that to the Minister for Health.

Mr Winter - It was your promise.

The SPEAKER - The Premier is within his rights to refer the question to the appropriate minister. In fact, I wish that would happen more often.

Mr Rockliff - So do I.

The SPEAKER - It is in your hands, Premier.

Mrs PETRUSMA - Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. I assure the House that through all of this situation, with the withdrawal of maternity services from the Hobart Private Hospital, our government's number one priority has been to ensure that mothers and babies have the support and services they need during their birthing journeys, both now and into the future.

The removal of the three beds at the Royal Hobart Hospital will happen. At the moment we have 29 beds. We can flex up to 31 at present, but this will allow us to go to 34 beds in case there are any mothers and bubs who want to come to the public hospital, the Royal Hobart Hospital. However, Calvary Hospital has told us it has over 300 bookings that were going to Hobart Private now going to Calvary. 

The intention of the federal government's $6 million commitment was to ensure that not only could we increase our capacity, but that Calvary could increase its capacity because parents who have paid private insurance want that.

Ms HADDAD - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. That is welcome information. However, the question was about the mother-baby unit at St Johns Park being reduced to a nine-to-five service, Monday to Friday, which is not a mother baby unit.

The SPEAKER - I will draw the minister to that question. 

Mrs PETRUSMA - I wanted to give some background to it. The intention of the federal government's funding is so that we can build a new mother and baby unit at St Johns Park. This will be an overnight service. It will not just be a day service. It will be a specialist intensive parenting support service, for mums and their bubs who have feeding or settling issues, or mum might have some anxiety. If that tips over to being postpartum psychosis, that will be still under the Minister for Mental Health and Wellbeing, Mr Jaensch, but in my area, it will be services where mums and their bubs will be able to go overnight to be looked after for a number of days so that they can get the intensive parenting support services they require.

No, it is not just a day service. Some parents might need a day service, but this is intended to be an intensive parenting support service so mums and their bubs can stay overnight for as many days as they require, so that they can go home with bub and go on their journey. 

As I indicated at my press conference a couple of weeks ago, we will have more to say. We have been working hard to get all these in place. We are working on the designs and concept plans now. As soon as it all comes together, I would welcome another question so I can show the plans and talk more about the service.

Supplementary Question

Ms HADDAD - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Ms HADDAD - Can the minister confirm whether that new service at St Johns Park will be staffed by mother-baby unit-trained nurses or by Child Health and Parenting Service (ChaPS) nursing staff?

The SPEAKER - Minister, it probably does go to the answer that you gave, if I can draw you to that.

Mrs PETRUSMA - Yes, it will be staffed by CHaPS nurses. Our CHaPS nurses are the experts at intensive parenting support services. It will be a different model. Mums who have intense mental health issues will be under minister Jaensch. The service that will be offered will be more of an intensive parenting support service run by CHaPS. They will be working overnight with the mothers and that will be a live-in sort of service. I will be able to update the House once the model is complete, but it will be an overnight service, I can assure that much, run by CHaPS.


Red Tape Reduction Coordinator - Role

Mrs BESWICK question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.12 a.m.]
You recently announced a crackdown on red tape, promising to reduce the burden for Tasmanian businesses. You have had a red tape reduction coordinator for the past 11 years. Can you point to an example of red tape reduction achieved during this term or is this recent announcement a concession that very little progress has been made?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. Thank you, also, for acknowledging the good announcements we have been making recently when it comes to the Small Business Start-up Permit, which has been welcomed. It was fantastic to be at X-Golf in Launceston the other day, being on the ground listening to some of the challenges small business faces - and in that case faced, when it comes to the start-up of its business and the rigmarole they had to go through, which meant they missed the Christmas rush. The business started in January a couple of years ago, or in early 2024, from memory.

There is a need to continue slashing red tape and regulations so businesses can go about their job safely, of course, but also create an environment where they can employ more people and grow their businesses. That is what I mean by governments getting out of the way and ensuring that red tape is minimised for the benefit of small businesses.

A report issued last November, the Tasmanian Red Tape Audit Report 2024, goes through a number of areas: removed requirement for farmers to complete an annual statutory declaration to continue to receive a vehicle registration rebate; introduced no permit required assessments; the introduction of online passes for National Park. There is a huge array of the these. 

I remember this one: simplifying the dam works approval process, including abolishing the Assessment Committee for Dam Construction (ACDC). That was Labor's committee, which was getting in the way of farmers building water storage for the benefit of the growth of their businesses. As Primary Industries minister, from memory, I took abolishing the ACDC through the parliament for the benefit of that red tape strangling farmers, getting out of the way to ensure farmers could sensibly, with environmental concerns always in mind, go about building water storage to ensure they have more opportunity in terms of livestock, crops and other matters.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.


Salmon Industry - Bacteria Information and Potential Antibiotic Resistance

Mr GARLAND question to MINISTER for ENVIRONMENT, Ms OGILVIE

[11.16 a.m.]
On Friday evening, Salmon Tasmania CEO Luke Martin posted a letter on Facebook stating that the mass salmon mortality event was the result of factors beyond anyone's control, citing summer conditions and a new strain of microbe. On Thursday last week, the government's Chief Veterinary Officer said this event was largely due to an endemic bacterium which has been around in Tasmania since at least 2021. The public is confused and concerned about the handling of the incident and unsure what to believe.

Who is the public to believe - the government's chief vet or the salmon industry - as to the cause of this mass die-off? Also, is this strain of bacterium killing thousands of tonnes of salmon resistant to vaccination and antibiotics being used by the industry?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. The specifics of the question probably sit with the Minister for Primary Industries and Water, Ms Howlett. However, I have some information I can provide you and will start with that. If we need to provide more, we can do that.

We are all deeply concerned about this event. It has touched everybody and I know the public wants more information. We are undertaking an EPA investigation, which is important. That happens at arm's length from government. I think it is important that it is independent. It is science and data-driven. I do not, as the minister, have the power to direct, nor would I ever seek to direct, the EPA.

In relation to the mortalities, as I have said, fish deaths are a known aspect of salmon farming, and we have seen these incidents being typically elevated during the summer months when warmer waters and other factors affecting salmon health are more likely to occur. Reports over recent months suggest widespread availability of nutrients along the east and south-east coast of Tasmania, brought in by the East Australian Current. Some algae, jellyfish and other marine organisms are a known irritant of salmon gills as well and may lead to increased mortalities. Marine heatwave conditions have occurred in waters immediately east of Tasmania over the past two summers and contribute to inter-annual variability of Storm Bay in particular.

As I have said, we are strong supporters of the salmon industry. It is a very heartbreaking situation for so many people to see this happening, but the EPA remains the agency responsible for managing the fish mortality event and associated deposits of fatty substances in the D'Entrecasteaux Channel.

Public Health is providing advice to the EPA and testing undertaken by the EPA has demonstrated that fatty substances are derived from fish and/or fish oil. Also, I am advised that the bacterium involved does not cause human disease and Public Health has issued some statements in relation to this but, of course, be sensible. Do not handle the things that you might come across. Wash your hands; take practical precautions. Do not make contact with the material. Wash it off with soap and water. Beaches remain open for use. We have a public health hotline for anybody who is deeply concerned.

In relation to the work of the testing being undertaken, that is one for the chief veterinary officer to answer, and I refer that question to the minister if you require further information on that.

The SPEAKER - With the 11 seconds left, are you forwarding the question to the other minister? You only have moments left.

Ms OGILVIE - Yes, I am forwarding it.

Supplementary Question

The SPEAKER - I am assuming I am getting a supplementary question?

Mr GARLAND - Yes, Speaker. We would like to know the strain of bacterium and if it is resistant to vaccinations and antibiotics?

The SPEAKER - I will call the minister for the supplementary. I am not sure whether we have a ruling on whether she can then forward it to the other minister, but if the minister could take the call, that would be great. Thank you.

Ms OGILVIE - I can answer it. I have just been provided with some information so I will do my best.
The microbe has been determined as the P. (Piscirickettsia) salmonis organism. It is a bacterium that only impacts salmonids and as a result of genetic testing conducted in 2024, more recently confirmed on 20 February 2025, the P. salmonis bacteria has been confirmed to be the same strain known to exist in eastern Tasmanian marine waters since 2021 and south-eastern Tasmanian marine waters since 2023.

Mr Garland - Antibiotics?

The SPEAKER - I am sorry, Mr Garland, you do not get a second supplementary. I note that you may find another way to ask the question. 


CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Moonah - Netball Facilities Upgrades and Investment

Ms BURNET question to MINISTER for SPORT and EVENTS, Mr ELLIS

[11.22 a.m.]
My question is from Jordan, my constituent in Moonah. I play netball and there are not enough courts available to accommodate the number of games and teams. The other issue is wear and tear. Outdoor courts such as at Bayswater Road require a more even surface to play safely. The Creek Road facility should be upgraded to host national games and to be a worthy home of netball in southern Tasmania. When is the government going to recognise the needs of women in sport, invest in netball in particular and help fund and upgrade netball facilities?


King Island - Government Role in Sale of King Island Dairy

Mr SHELTON question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

Many in our community are excited to hear of the recent announcement of the sale of the iconic King Island Dairy facility and brand - the on-site cheese store and the local farms that provide a guaranteed milk supply. Please outline what role the government had in saving King Island Dairy and providing future employment on the island?

The SPEAKER - I will note that Constituency Questions are supposed to be from your own constituency. Is there a link to your constituency that you might like - 

Members interjecting.

Mr Abetz - Yes, all Tasmanians - 

The SPEAKER - I do not need your help. I need Mr Shelton to explain how it is linked.

Mr SHELTON - There are many dairy farmers in Lyons - and many people excited about the outcome -

The SPEAKER - that feed into King Island. That makes it a local question. Thank you, Mr Shelton. See? I am paying attention to constituency questions.
West Coast District Hospital - Driving Subcontractors

Ms DOW question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

My question is from my constituent, Gavin, who lives in Queenstown. Gavin wants to know: if the government is serious about fixing the budget, will they review the use of driving subcontractors for maintenance of the West Coast District Hospital?


JackJumpers Games in the North

Mr FAIRS question to MINISTER for SPORT and EVENTS, Mr DUIGAN

I have been approached by several members in my electorate of Bass who are very keen basketball fans. While they have enjoyed being able to watch JackJumpers' games in the north on occasion, they are keen to know whether there will be opportunities in the future, particularly as the venue is always sold out and tickets are hard to get.


Rehabilitation Providers - Requirement for Tertiary Qualifications

Ms FINLAY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

Cherie of Launceston runs a workplace rehabilitation business which has been impacted by your new rules that require her and her staff to obtain tertiary qualifications at a minimum cost of $40,000 per person to continue the work the business has been doing for 25 years. According to Cherie, the purpose of the change is to implement a new framework for Tasmanian providers and no longer recognise the existing nationally consistent approval framework. She has a caseload of over 450 clients and they are one of the few remaining Tasmanian workplace rehabilitation providers.

Cherie has asked: if the government is so focused on removing red tape to help her business, why has it repeatedly refused requests for meetings and requests for assistance since 2023? Why has this change been necessary given the impact on her business and the fact that there is already a national framework in place?


PETITION

Salmon Industry - Petuna - Farming Leases

[11.26 a.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I have the honour to be the bearer of a petition signed by approximately 1367 petitioners. The petition conforms with the relevant Standing Orders and Rules of the House.

To the honourable Speaker and members of the House of Assembly, 

We, the undersigned residents of the electorate of Lyons, draw to the House's attention that Petuna is engaged in the planning process for salmon farming leases off Yellow Bluff, Storm Bay. Storm Bay, together with Frederick Henry Bay and Norfolk Bay are treasured by our community. There is a high risk that finfish farming in this area could impact on the health and wellbeing of our bays and its residents.

In addition, inland hatcheries pollute our waters and threaten some of our most iconic natural environments. Your petitioners therefore request the House to call on the government to stop further expansion and permanently withdraw all leases for finfish farming in Storm Bay, Frederick Henry Bay, and Norfolk Bay.

This is to:

Ensure ocean beaches and rivers are free of fish farm induced ecological harm;

Protect the habitat for critically endangered red handfish;

Ensure continuation of recreational fish stocks in both marine and fresh water environments; and 

Protect us and our waterways from finfish operations and debris.

Signed by approximately 1367 petitioners.

Petition received.

MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Impact of Privatisation on Tasmanian Tourism Industry

[11.31 a.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House take note of the following matter: Impact of privatisation on Tasmanian tourism industry

I rise today to talk about the TT-Line and its importance to Tasmanian tourism and industry. Not 'the tourism industry', but tourism and industry. Today, I want to restate the conversations that I am having across the state about the way that this government is handling our TT-Line. When I say our TT-Line, I mean our TT-Line. It is a company that Tasmanians have built and Tasmanians have owned and a company that Tasmanians are proud of. I think this government has made a huge underestimation of Tasmanian's love for this company when they put this on the chopping block along with the Motor Accidents Insurance Board (MAIB), TasNetworks and other government entities which are now well and truly for sale. 

Tasmania is an island state and it is an island state meaning that we need to make sure we have a strategic and important stake in shipping in and out of this state. We have made those decisions for 40 years: in fact, longer than that. Through the acquisition of ships to replace the private sector which was failing in the 80s, Tasmania has made a conscious decision that we want to have some control over shipping into this state: shipping for freight for our primary producers so they can get their produce off island, but also for our tourism industry that also relies on having a shipping service that works to allow people to get on and off the island. That is now at risk and it is at risk from two key things.

The first is that this government cannot manage its government businesses and over those 40 years we have never seen anything like the last 12 months in particular, but 24 months and three years before that of this government's complete ineptitude when it comes to running TT-Line. This is a government that spent almost a billion dollars buying new ships and when they were almost ready to arrive, realised that they had not built the berth that actually allowed them to operate.

It sounds ridiculous and if you came from another planet you would not believe it is true, but yet it is. The next step they have taken, after having admitted that they have completely stuffed this up, they are costing the Tasmanian economy half a billion dollars every year, was to try and lease those ships, to try and lease them for Ukrainian refugees to be on for - we do not really know - up to 18 months potentially, negotiating with what they thought was a foreign entity that turned out to be just a broker. They said they were negotiating on behalf of Tasmanians looking to do the right thing, when in fact what they did was the complete wrong thing. They have already wasted almost $2 million trying to lease that ship in Scotland and it will be closer to $4 million if they keep the current timeline, which is to leave them there until the middle of the year. It is disgraceful. What has happened is complete ineptitude.

The next step, having not been able to lease the ship, is to effectively put them up for sale. Only some period afterwards, now deciding that our new ships that we spent almost a billion dollars on, that we could not lease for Ukrainian refugees, now they want to put them up for sale. Deputy Speaker, you could not make this stuff up. It is complete ineptitude and I am hearing concerns around the tourism industry. I note that the Tourism minister has chosen not to be here today and perhaps he could go out and have a chat to some of the businesses I spoke to last Wednesday when I was at the Tourism Industry Council Tasmania (TICT) function and over the weekend speaking to operators about the risks that there are with the privatisation of our TT-Line.

TT-Line is in public hands because that is where it belongs, because it is strategically important for us to be able to get freight on and off island quickly. It is important for us to be able to bring more tourists to this state. Tasmanians know what happened in 2002 when we bought our new Spirits to this state. It increased the number of tourists exponentially, for years. The number of tourism businesses in this state today is more than double what it was in 2002. The number of tourists has doubled since those days where Tasmanians made a big investment decision.

It was criticised by some in the Liberal Party, but it was the right decision then and the wrong decision now in this state to sell those assets. Those assets should be front of mind. They should be acknowledged for what they are, which is a critical piece of Tasmania's tourism infrastructure and freight infrastructure. The idea from this government that they can sell them, particularly during a period of time in which they have totally stuffed it up, in which it is laden with debt to the point where we still have not had an update about the debt-servicing issues with TT-Line that threatened to sink the company, is wrong.

Tasmanians will not stand for this sale and they will not stand for the sales this government is putting forward.

Time expired.

[11.36 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, about one in eight Tasmanians are employed in the tourism sector. The tourism sector is largely driven by the private sector: mums and dads who have invested. Another fun fact is that about 90 per cent plus of the tourists who come to this state, come here via the airports.

Mr Winter - Oh, so it is not important.

Mr ABETZ - This is something that makes the Labor Party very quiet because they know they sold the airport, Hobart Airport. Has that in any way negatively impacted on the tourism sector? No. Indeed, we are gracious enough on this side to acknowledge that that was a good idea. Like federally, we were willing to acknowledge that privatisation under that great Labor hero, Bob Hawke, and Paul Keating, was also a good idea. Think Qantas, another major carrier of tourists to Tasmania. We have got the double whammy under Labor, an airline and an airport being sold by Labor in no way negatively impacting the tourism sector in this state.

Therefore, the question has to be asked: why is this current Labor regime - in opposition, thankfully - so hell-bent on not asking the fundamental question: how can we best serve the people of Tasmania with the various entities that are currently in government ownership? We are not saying that we will sell any entity. What we are saying is we are scoping to ascertain what is the best way of delivering the various services the government business enterprises deliver for the benefit of the people of Tasmania. Those who had the misfortune of hearing the Leader of the Opposition's speech would be reminded of the fact that it was a full five minutes of negativity. Not a single solution - 

Members interjecting.

Mr ABETZ - That was a delayed yawn from the member for Braddon, undoubtedly in response to the Leader of the Opposition's speech. I cannot blame him for that yawn, for that affected yawn.

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order, members on my left.

Mr ABETZ - We, as a government, are willing to ask the tough questions, see what is within the best interest of Tasmania and Tasmanians, and we will await what the answers might be. I might add that any privatisation, should it be recommended, should it be adopted by government, would need to be ratified by this parliament. Therefore, the scare campaign currently being run by the Leader of the Opposition and his cohort is disingenuous at best, misleading and mischievous in the current state.

It seems Labor privatisation considerations, good; Liberal privatisation considerations, by definition, must be bad. That simplistic, stupid approach to public policy is exactly what the people of Tasmania dislike in this discourse.

In relation to the TT-Line, let us be very clear: there have been genuine mistakes made, to which the Premier, the government and the TT-Line interim chair have acknowledged and opened up to. The question the people of Tasmania now face is, given the current circumstance: do you trust Premier Rockliff and current Minister for Transport, Eric Abetz, to fix the problem -

Mr Winter - No.

Mr ABETZ - or do you think the Leader of the Opposition and shadow transport spokesman are better qualified and better suited to fix the problem?

Opposition members - Hear, hear.

Mr ABETZ - I know what I hear around the community: dissatisfaction with what has occurred, but confidence that we are on the way to fixing it under leadership of the new chair of the TT-Line, a new project manager of TT-Line and a soon-to-be-announced new CEO of TT-Line, with a comprehensive government business enterprise reform package being led by the Premier and Deputy Premier. Solutions, not scares. That is what we are delivering, and that is why the people have confidence in what we are undertaking.

Time expired.

[11.41 a.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak on this matter of public importance. Reflecting on the leader of government business's contribution, talking about Liberal privatisation, it is history repeating itself. We had a minority Liberal government in the 1990s drowning in debt, and what was their solution? They wanted to sell the Hydro. We now have Premier Rockliff who, through his government's decisions, is now drowning in debt. They have put the Liberal Party's short-term political fortunes ahead of Tasmania every time. Now they are drowning in debt, and what is their solution? They want to sell everything else. However, there is a big difference here. Back in the 1990s, that government had the conviction to take it to the people. This government has no mandate. They did not talk about it in the election campaign because they know it stinks. 

We are an island wholly reliant on the shipping industry for tourism, primary producers and freight movements. However, this government is not very good at procuring ships, even though we are so reliant on it. The biggest infrastructure stuff-up has been an international embarrassment. What is their solution? They are going to sell. Everything is on the table at the moment, including TT-Line. We just had a contribution from the leader of government business justifying selling TT-Line, which has been an enormous success for this state. I have lost count of how many Liberal ministers turned up to Estimates and different forums, singing the praises of TT-Line and how wonderful it is going for Tasmania. Now, they want to sell it. 

It would be a huge mistake. It would be catastrophic in terms of competition. We are an island. We need to maintain some control over our own destiny. If you sell off a connection to the mainland like that, how do we do things like increase capacity by 40 per cent? We make those decisions because the public own it. What would happen if it was in private ownership? Probably what happened to TasRail. It would be stripped of assets, underinvestment and then, at some stage, the shipping company would come back to the government and say, 'We need a bailout now, otherwise we are going to reduce services further. We need a bailout to replace the ships because they are at end of life'. What would end up happening is the government would have to buy it back. We are still fixing up the infrastructure from that Liberal privatisation agenda in the 1990s for rail. The tourism industry is a very important industry in our economy. We need to make sure it is supported and that we maintain public ownership over our destiny. 

We need to make sure there is accountability. We have seen accountability through this whole saga that would not happen if it was in the private sector. We have seen the biggest infrastructure stuff-up in our state's history in failing to develop the port at Devonport, even though the government spent $1 billion on two new ships. We have had accountability. That is how our Westminster system works. We have had the minister fall on his sword because he no longer had the support of parliament. We have had the government respond with some GBE reforms - GBE reforms they copied from this side of the House. They criticised it to start with, but there are key governance issues that need to be fixed. Accountability. This would not happen if it was the private sector.

Just last week, we had the Health minister give a very good example of privatised services that do not work in the interest of the community. She was lamenting about a board that has no connection to Tasmania making commercial decisions to reduce services to the community which was not in the best interest of the community here. That was a great example from the Health minister and I thank her for that contribution last week.

If it comes to the TT-Line, we will fight the privatisation agenda of this government at every twist and turn. The TT-Line is something Tasmanians are incredibly proud of. I think many Tasmanians are attached to the TT-Line the way they are to the Hydro. It is part of our history, part of our success. We are an island. We should maintain a shipping company in public ownership. If the government tries to bring legislation to parliament to sell the TT-Line, we will strongly oppose it because it is not in the interest of this state.

Time expired.

[11.46 a.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Deputy Speaker, let us circle back to the original privatisation idea from this government, this Liberal government that brought forward the expressions of interest (EOI) process to privatise our parks, our public lands, our Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, which is protected with the intent that it is there for future generations. The scheme to privatise it through the EOI has resulted in nine projects coming through in 10 years. That is not enhancing our tourism industry at all. In fact, it has been an enormous detriment to it, not only nationally but internationally.

The first project through the EOI process that showed how terrible this was, was the Lake Malbena heli-tourism proposal. It has recently come out that the proponent has not even been paying his invoices. He was in arrears to Parks. This scam of a scheme has not even been making us any money. It has copped criticism from the World Heritage Committee multiple times, back from when we adjusted the boundaries to facilitate it. This has to be causing serious concern within the Tasmanian community because how that has been handled in the past is a blueprint of concern for how the privatisation of GBEs and other public assets is going to be held moving forward. 

The Lake Malbena lease is coming up for another extension on 31 March, just a few weeks away. Is this government going to continue down this path and renew it again, despite the fact that the proponent was asked by the federal government more than 12 months ago to provide the documents they needed to progress the EPBC (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999) referral? It is still not there. Has all the money to Parks been paid up? Is all of that up to date at the present time? 

It is seriously concerning to Tasmanians and it has really set out what will be. Through that EOI process, nine projects in 10 years have gone through. However, there have been multiple projects that have been withdrawn from that process. Is that because the process is terrible? Is it because there is no confidence in it? It is certainly not building confidence for those within our tourism industry who are going through the proper processes, proper public consultation, who are being very transparent with all Tasmanians and operating on their public land, because they do not know what is going on behind the scenes. Everything is hidden in secrecy behind this shield, this lack of transparency, under the alias of commercial-in-confidence.  It is public land and the public have every right to understand what is actually happening and what businesses are currently proposing.

Look at what has happened as our waterways have been privatised off to the salmon industry. If we are going to privatise things, there has to be proper regulation put in place. That is completely at odds with the same government proposal put on the same day talking about privatising GBEs - that we have too many laws, too many regulations or too many words in Tasmania. We are going to need more if this proposal is to ever be put forward sensibly so that Tasmanians still have a say in what is actually happening, so that anything that is privatised can actually be properly governed. That is not what we are currently seeing happen and there is absolutely no confidence that it can go forward. The two ideas do not sensibly coexist and they cannot.

If this government cannot handle its own policy in the EOI process, how on earth can Tasmanians have confidence that they could privatise anything else with any kind of responsibility? That is why it is tremendous that the Labor Party and the crossbench are opposing this ridiculous idea.

[11.49 a.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Deputy Speaker, one of the fun facts we have learned throughout this whole debate about privatisation - which the Premier announced only last week as part of his latest iteration of his reset for his government - is that the only explanation that the government has provided for sweeping privatisation across Tasmanian public assets is because this government forgot to build a berth in Devonport - berth 3. That is the only explanation that the Premier has provided. This further highlights the government's pure and sheer incompetence managing large projects across this state, but not only that, managing our budget. As my colleague the shadow treasurer said, time and time again this government has put the Liberal Party before Tasmanians and the best interests of Tasmanians, and that continues to be their priority. That is why we are in the mess that we are in in Tasmania right now. There is nothing more certain than that fun fact.

As everyone knows, I am from the beautiful north-west. You are obviously not talking to the right people, minister Abetz, because people I speak to on the street have completely lost confidence in this Premier, his minority government, and their ability to get anything done in this state. The Spirit of Tasmania fiasco is the headline to all that lack of confidence and trust in this government moving forward, and whether it actually has the best interests of Tasmanians at heart. I do not think it does, and the people I speak to do not think it does. 

The people I speak to are those small to medium enterprises across the north-west region - those involved in tourism, retail, small business, cafe operators - who were waiting with so much anticipation for these new Spirits so that they could have more customers coming into their stores, growing their businesses. They are so disheartened. This government had one job: to build a berth to enable those new vessels to berth. They did not do it. They let those businesses down, and they continue to let those businesses down.

If we privatise the Spirit of Tasmania vessels, which this government, I might add, has not ruled out - from the contribution from minister Abetz earlier this morning, it is pretty clear that he is quite excited about the prospect of privatising the Spirit of Tasmania vessels.

Tasmanians care deeply about their Spirits, and as my colleague, the shadow treasurer, said, I reckon that they care as much about the Hydro as they do their Spirits, especially where I live in the north-west, which I might add is the Premier's electorate. They will not forgive this government or this Premier if they sell their Spirits. I am putting you on notice that you need to rule it out.

There is no way of controlling the operating environment of the Spirits if you privatise them, or enforcing their mandate around servicing the north-west and making sure that tourists turn right. The whole point of the Spirit vessels was to increase outreach tourism and economic development right across the state into the regions. They also perform an important freight task for local producers in my region, who have been let down by the fact that they have not had additional capacity over this summer and with other services being off the run.

Deputy Speaker, it is important that the Spirit of Tasmania vessels remain in Tasmanians' hands. Tasmanians will not stand for it. There will be no way of trying to increase winter demand. You will have no control over that as a government. This government business was set up to service and grow the Tasmanian tourism industry. It has done that very well over a number of decades; it has been very successful. It is only really the last mishap that has been overseen by this government which has disrupted that.

It is absolutely essential that the Spirit of Tasmania vessels remain in Tasmanians' hands. They care deeply about them. They would be distressed, I think, to hear minister Abetz's contribution this morning - the tone, the excitement in his voice when he talks about selling their Spirits and the benefits that he claims that will bring to Tasmanians.

We do not support it. We will fight it every inch of the way. There is no way that the people of Braddon will stand by and let this government privatise the Spirit of Tasmania.

[11.55 a.m.]
Mr FAIRS (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, an important part of our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future is to continue to build on Tasmania's reputation as a world-leading tourism destination. We need to highlight Tasmania's unique experiences and ensure that the visitor economy continues to have a positive impact on Tasmania's environment, economy and way of life. Tourism supports 42,900, or one in eight, Tasmanian jobs. If you know eight Tasmanians, odds are one of them is thanking tourists for their pay cheque.

Visitors directly spend around $3.5 billion annually in Tasmania. This substantial expenditure fuels various industries, including hospitality, retail, transportation and cultural experiences, reinforcing tourism as a key pillar of Tasmania's economic growth and sustainability. Tasmania has a reputation as a world-leading tourism destination. That is where our government has taken tourism over the past decade. We are an appealing travel destination. However, there is no doubt we are operating in a competitive market and a challenging environment with cost-of-living pressures impacting on travel everywhere.

Tourism Tasmania undertakes a range of marketing activities to generate demand for travel to Tasmania and to support this important Tasmanian industry. Tourism Tasmania's aim is to continuously drive demand and bookings for travel to the state and to continue building demand for the future. Tourism Tasmania targets audiences that are willing to spend more and disperse further across the state for greater benefit to all Tasmanians.

Destination marketing plays a critical role in creating awareness and overcoming the barriers to travel to Tasmania. Our state depends on a thriving tourism sector in all regions. If we do not continue to focus on building future demand for travel, we will not achieve our long-term visitation growth targets for the state.

The domestic Come Down for Air campaign has been in the market since October 2024, aiming to increase brand awareness and drive consideration of Tasmania as a year-round holiday destination. As part of the Tasmanian government's Spirits Tourism and Hospitality Support package, Tourism Tasmania launched an intrastate marketing campaign to encourage Tasmanians to spend their money in the local tourism and hospitality industry over the spring and summer months. The agency has worked closely with operators to create more than 300 unique experiences and events for the 2025 off-season campaign, which we promoted across Australia. The off-season campaign positions Tasmania as a must-do winter experience, smoothing out seasonality and supporting businesses by driving visitation over the traditionally quieter, cooler months.

On privatisation, the Premier has said that we are open-minded about the possibility of divestment of government businesses and other assets. We said that we will work through this in a sensible, methodical way to make the best decisions possible. Importantly, we are only looking at divestment if it is in the best interests of Tasmanians.

Saul Eslake has spoken about the reasonableness of the government, asking whether there is a continuing rationale to maintain state ownership of GBEs. Saul is working with us and will provide advice to the government to ensure our review of government businesses achieves the outcomes we need.

The Premier has stated that we will be keeping everyone informed and should the sale proceed, then we will invest that into a future fund.

Back to the tourism industry, at the 2024 election the government committed a total of $51.67 million to support and develop Tasmania's tourism and hospitality industries. Thanks to our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future following passage of the 2024-25 Budget, our commitments are well underway, including $12 million to implement the 2030 Visitor Economic Strategy over three years, more than $8 million over three years for the Tasmanian Hospitality Association to continue its industry development and support programs, a funding agreement that is in place with the Tasmanian Hospitality Association, and $6.5 million to deliver $50 million Regional Tourism Development Loan Scheme to stimulate regional tourism. The scheme has been launched and is accepting applications. Finally, $5 million over four years for a dedicated aviation fund to increase air access to Tasmania. The funding program was launched in January this year and is currently accepting applications. 

Our aspiration is to achieve 1.6 million interstate visitors and 400,000 international visitors by 2030, growing visitation sustainably. This will represent an additional 750,000 visitors to Tasmania by 2030, an estimated growth of $5.6 billion.

[12.00 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I thank the Labor Party for bringing this important matter of public interest for debate. We have talked about the debacle of the TT-Line and TasPorts' delay of those ferries, and it has hit tourism very hard. The impact on the north west businesses, in particular - and Ms Dow spoke about those and I have spoken about that before - is incredibly damaging. It is so damaging and so much so that this has cost the government $500,000 for a Regional Hospitality Revival Fund which was announced in 2024, so, a bailout of a damaged tourism sector.

The billion-dollar infrastructure and transport nightmare which is the TT-Line ferries - TT-Line and TasPorts debacle has caused enormous brand damage to Tasmania. We have seen that worldwide. We have unfortunately seen Tasmania become a laughingstock because these ferries have not been able to be delivered and so, what we saw with some of the fallout of TT-Lines and TasPorts is a governance review. 

It is all very well having a governance review of our state-owned companies and GBEs, partly as a result of that, and partly because it had not been investigated for quite some time nor reviewed. Before this governance review is complete, there was a suggestion by the government to merge TT-Line, TasPorts and TasRail. That looks like it is set for sale to the highest bidder and we know that there is clear folly, as Mr Willie has spoken about, in relation to selling off TasRail before and having to buy it back again.

There are huge risks to the government, not only in the brand for Tasmania and the brand damage that we have already seen, but specifically those small tourism operators, particularly in the north-west, affecting the whole of Tasmania. This has a huge impact on the tourism sector and I think the government forgets that with privatisation and this talk of privatisation that there is real concern about the impact on individuals and individual security. It is all very well the Premier blaming Labor for a scare campaign, but I would be very scared if I were a public sector employee with the government's move to privatise GBEs and various institutions. It is not good enough.

My colleague, Ms Badger, talked about the impact of a private industry and privatisation of our waters with the salmon industry and it is such a bad look for Tasmania and for the government not to take heed of this is of great concern.

[12.03 p.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I stand this morning, pleased to be able to back in this matter of public importance raised by our leader this morning around tourism and the impacts of privatisation, particularly with the Spirits as a centrepiece.

Tasmania is known globally for the incredible tourism assets that we have here and Australians and Tasmanians and visitors internationally have, for many years, enjoyed travelling to Tasmania on the Spirits. It is unbelievable that the government, at this point, where they are trying to launch off distraction and provide a cover-up for their incompetence, where we have the Spirit of Tasmania on the other side of the world being featured on international news and part of a parody on the script of tourism, hop-on, hop-off buses when they can see a Spirit of Tasmania in Scotland, we do not even have the ships fully completed yet. They are not in Tasmania and the government is already seeking to sell the ships to cover up their extraordinary incompetence to not be able to deliver them on time or in budget, or to deliver the wharf infrastructure.

This morning I rise to make sure that Tasmanians are aware that, while this government has absolutely destroyed this budget and the economic opportunities not only for all Tasmanians across most sectors, but importantly, our tourism operators across the north-west coast of Tasmania -

APPROPRIATION (SUPPLEMENTARY APPROPRIATION FOR 2024-25) BILL 2025 (No. 1)

Second Reading

[12.05 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Treasurer) - Deputy Speaker, the Appropriation (Supplementary Appropriation for 2024-25) Bill 2025 seeks a supplementary appropriation of $467.5 million out of the public account for the operating services of government for this financial year. The supplementary appropriation is required to meet above budget expenditure for operating and demand cost pressures for existing government services and programs since the finalisation of the 2024-25 Budget.

Tasmania has not been immune to cost pressures in our health system and we will always prioritise providing the best quality healthcare to our patients. We also know that the federal Labor government's failure to meet their obligation of 45 per cent of the cost of servicing our hospitals has also contributed to cost pressures in our health system. An appropriation of $345 million is sought for the Department of Health across the health and mental health and wellbeing portfolios. This includes $340 million to address health services demand growth, together with increases in the cost of health service delivery, particularly in relation to hospital-admitted and non-admitted services; and $4.97 million to address continuing demand pressures on the delivery of mental health services in Tasmania, including an increase in registered statewide mental health services, consumers and emergency department presentations.

Additional appropriation of $42.9 million is required for the Department of Justice across the justice, corrections, and rehabilitation portfolios. This includes $25 million to meet cost pressures for the Tasmanian Prison Service, including overtime due to continuing difficulty attracting and maintaining sufficient levels of correctional staff, growth in the prison population, increases in workers compensation premiums and general prison expenses such as food and clothing; and $17.9 million to meet the anticipated above budget payments for redress and civil claims compensation payments.

The bill provides an additional operating services appropriation of $21.2 million for the Department of Education, Children and Young People, which includes: $14.1 million to support an increase in the number of children accessing special care packages and an increase in the cost of these packages; $2.95 million for additional staff resourcing to meet increased calls to the advice and referral line; and $4.14 million for staff resourcing at the Ashley Youth Detention Centre.

For the Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management, $14.5 million is required to meet anticipated above-budget expenditure for the rising cost of workers compensation premiums, which is driven by an increase in case complexity and number.

Additionally, for the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania, $8 million is required to meet above-budget operational costs in Tasmanian national parks and reserves, including additional programs and associated expenditure to meet land management and legislative obligations, increased maintenance and other costs associated with increased visitation, new visitor facilities and fly out waste from remote toilets.

In addition to operating and demand cost pressures for existing government services and programs, the bill seeks $35.9 million for expenditure related to decisions of the government since the finalisation of the 2024-25 budget. Of this amount:

$11 million is sought to meet the cost of the government's response to the severe weather events across Tasmania in August and September 2024. The government response provided grants for the purpose of emergency food relief, flood assistance, and recovery and restoration programs following the storms.

$10.5 million to support the reopening of the Dolphin Tungsten Mine.

$4.5 million for a tourism and hospitality support package to assist operators impacted by cost-of-living pressures and the delays to the new Spirit of Tasmania vessels becoming operational.

$8 million to increase the state's contribution to TasRail to improve the ongoing reliability, efficiency and safety of its services.

$1.2 million for Homes Tasmania to implement the government's commitment to a Women in Crisis accommodation initiative supporting women and their children at the former Bethlehem House site in Hobart.

$500,000 for a grant to Wine Tasmania to support the wine industry with export market development activities and domestic market promotion.

$180,000 to fulfil final payments under the Tasmanian Home Builder Grant program.

Deputy Speaker, I commend the bill to the House.

[12.12 a.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak on the Appropriation (Supplementary Appropriation for 2024-25) Bill 2025. I am thinking that members on that side of the House must be really questioning Premier Rockliff, the current Treasurer and the former treasurer's approach. If they are not questioning it, they probably should start thinking about it. Up until this point we have had the Treasurer and the Premier saying that our debt position is manageable, that there is some mythical pathway to a surplus. They had no evidence to back that claim. If there was some attempt to claw back wasteful spending and new spending, it might have been a credible position for them to maintain. We saw no evidence of that.

They went from that position to, out of the blue, the Premier coming to this parliament last week and basically telling Tasmanians he had bankrupted the state and that there is a fire sale. Not just one or two GBEs are for sale; it is the whole lot, apart from Hydro. That is the messaging on that side of the House: 'We have bankrupted the state after maintaining that the debt position was manageable, that there is some mythical pathway to surplus' - to Armageddon.

Mr Rockliff did not come to this House with two or three formed-up proposals and try to sell the benefits of them, even though that would be against all evidence because privatisation is a failed experiment. He came to the parliament with a thought bubble and very poor messaging. 

Thinking members on that side of the House must be starting to question their position and their prospects because this is a proposal that did not go to the Tasmanian people and we know that Tasmanians do not like privatisation. It is history repeating itself. I will get to the bill in a moment, but I am talking about a number of matters that surround this supplementary appropriation bill. It is history repeating. We had a Liberal minority government in the 1990s, drowning in debt, taking a proposal to the Tasmanian people to sell the Hydro because they had not been able to manage the money. It was resoundingly rejected by the Tasmanian people. This government does not have the courage of its convictions. It did not take those sorts of proposals to the people last year because they know it stinks.

We have this supplementary appropriation bill for $467.512 million of additional money and it follows the Revised Estimates Report. The budget only received royal assent on 1 November last year, so this government cannot even maintain a budget for six months. That is how bad things have become. Since the budget received royal assent in November last year, they have been spending nearly $4 million a day that was not in the budget. It is a government that has lost all fiscal discipline, that has completely lost control and is sending Tasmania over the fiscal cliff with a thought bubble as their fix. Quite a lot of these budget blowouts were entirely foreseeable. I raised this point in Estimates with the former treasurer, and I will get to that in a moment.

We have seen in the Revised Estimates Report that revenues were revised up by $49.7 million just this year and by $723.6 million across the Budget and forward Estimates. However, expenses have been revised up by $553.1 million this year and by $1.07 billion across the Budget and forward Estimates. That means that for every additional dollar of new revenue this year, the government has spent $10. This additional spending has not improved outcomes by any note. We have some of the worst health and education outcomes in the country and we have too many Tasmanians who cannot put a roof over their head. It largely reflects cost blowouts in key agencies: $345 million for health demand, $80 million in prison costs, $42 million in police workers compensation premiums, and $32 million for Parks operations.

There is no pathway to surplus - a mythical pathway to surplus. With this privatisation agenda, they are not going to be able to demonstrate a pathway to surplus in the upcoming budget because they are not going to be able to indicate to markets what they think some of these businesses are worth to offset the debt. The forecast for smaller deficits in the out years cannot be relied upon. You have been dodgy accountants most of the time you have been here. The Revised Estimates Report, for example, shows $345 million in additional health expenditure just for this year, not accounted for in the other three years. It is a billion-dollar black hole right there. We also know that there are plenty of programs in the forward Estimates that end. The government has every intention of continuing them, but they are not funded. 

In Estimates with the former treasurer, I said, 'It is almost certain that you are going to blow the budget'. He took umbrage at that, became very unhappy, and said that I was criticising Treasury's forecasting and a whole range of other things. Guess what? It has come to fruition, because there were very unrealistic assumptions in the budget.

For example, on Health expenditure, they were predicting $600 million less on Health across the forward Estimates and now we have a massive blowout in Health. This was entirely foreseeable. It is because they are dodgy accountants; they do not actually account for things properly.

The Revised Estimates Report now anticipates cash deficits totalling $4.6 billion over the four years to 2027-28. That is $801 million more than forecast in the 2024-25 Budget. It is the cash balance that drives changes in net debt, not the net operating balance that the Treasurer talks about or the Premier talks about. It is the cash position that drives net debt. These larger cash deficits mean that net debt is forecast to rise by a staggering $6.3 billion over the four years to 30 June 2028 to $9.64 billion - $1.05 billion more than what has been forecast in the Budget. We have this significantly deteriorating position. We have a government that is not being honest about the projections in the budget, and we have these big blowouts.

I went through some of the expenditure scenarios or history with the former treasurer in Estimates and he rubbished it. That period that they like to talk about on that side of the House where there were budgets where hard decisions were being made - in 2011-2012, government expenditure grew by 1.8 per cent; in 2012-2013 it grew by 3.2 per cent; and in 2013-14 it grew by 0.8 per cent. Through the COVID years we had the budget grow in 2020-21 by 7.3 per cent; in 2021-22 it grew by 12 per cent. In 2022-23, arguably when we were on the way out of COVID, government expenditure grew by 8.5 per cent, and by 2023-24, last year, there was a record deficit and 14.7 per cent in expenditure growth.

Guess what? In their budget that they passed last year, what were their projections? In 2024-25 they were going to decrease government expenditure by 3.5 per cent. Next year, they were projecting that they were going to decrease government expenditure by 2.7 per cent. They do have some growth in 2026-27 - 1.5 per cent; and then again in 2027-28, negative 1.2 per cent. No wonder we are back here less than six months after the budget was passed, with the Liberal credit card out, saying to the parliament, can we please have some more money?

It is because you have dodgy assumptions in your budget. You have been trying to hide the truth from Tasmanians for far too long, maintaining a position that the debt is manageable, that there is some mythical pathway to surplus while showing no evidence of fiscal restraint or trying to claw back new spending or wasteful spending, which was their position. Coming into this parliament last week, the Premier said that the state is bankrupt and we have got to take all of this drastic action regarding privatisation. You can see it reflected in the letters to the editor and in the community over the weekend. People are absolutely shocked. The messaging on that side of the House is all over the shop, and I am sure there are thinking members on that side of the House questioning the leadership. 

What does this all mean? It means that net debt is nearly at $10 billion in the last year of the forward Estimates and that is without the budget black holes. It is actually worse. It means that we have significant interest repayments now baked into the budget - $1.5 billion across the forward Estimates in interest repayments. That is not to pay debt down. The cash position will help us do that. That is just to service the record Liberal debt - $500 million alone in the last year of the forward Estimates.

We have the credit rating agencies breathing down our neck. We had S&P last year issue an outlook downgrade for Tasmania from stable to negative. They put some benchmarks in their assessment for Tasmania on when they will downgrade our credit rating. We had Moody's this year come out with a very similar statement. They were questioning this government's budget discipline. They were questioning weakening governance in Tasmania. They were questioning the fiscal strategy and whether it was worth the paper it was written on, because this government showed no intention at that time of paying any attention to it.

If we move down the pathway we are heading down, we will have significantly higher interest rates on this record Liberal debt. That is going to take an increasing share of the revenue pie, which means there is less money available for schools and hospitals and the things that Tasmanians care about.

In this Supplementary Appropriation we have a whole host of things that are the result of poor planning, poor workforce management, poor workforce development, and things that could be avoided with better governance and better leadership.

If I move to the first area, which is the Department of Education, Children and Young People, we have money there for the advice and referral line. I will actually acknowledge that there is an increase in those services in terms of the demand because of the commission of inquiry and people's awareness. That is fair enough. Out-of-home care: the amount of $14.1 million is provided to support an increase in the number of children accessing specialist care packages and an increase in the cost of these packages. Additional funding for out-of-home care was provided in the 2024-25 Budget as part of this government's response to the commission of inquiry recommendations. That all sounds fine.

If you talk to people within the sector, a lot of these specialist care packages are often a last resort because lots of things have gone wrong for these children along the way. They need wrap-around supports, which are expensive. Many of these children have had red flags all the way along and a lack of intervention when they could have had better outcomes - re-engaging with education, perhaps employment, and not needing a specialist care package down the track. We are seeing these significant increases in support required because it is an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. We are not seeing that it is pre-emptive intervention that is required to support these children and it is becoming very costly. We are not seeing it. You can shake your head, minister, but -

Mr Jaensch - We can unpack your understanding of special care packages another time, Mr Willie.

Mr WILLIE - I am repeating things that I hear in the sector. Then we have Ashley, which this government has acknowledged is not fit for purpose, and the outcomes for those children are shocking: recidivism; a life of institutionalisation. We have had horrific abuse within that institution and we have had significant concerns about the staffing of that institution. We have had an amount of $4.14 million to provide funding for additional staffing costs at Ashley Youth Detention Centre. Additional overtime costs have been incurred as a result of staff who are on long-term sick leave and require backfilling, and there is the cost of providing short-term operational staffing to cover sick leave. What sort of action have we seen when the government has acknowledged that this facility is not fit for purpose? The outcomes are shocking. We have seen the goal posts shift.

The government made a commitment to close it within three years, which it did not do. We have had endless words and statements from members of the government saying that they are trying to do something about it. We have a site out at Pontville. I have seen a sign erected out there when I have been heading north. What action have we had? Very little when it comes to that facility and the costs that are associated with it.

Health, if we move to that. An amount of $340 million is provided to address health services, demand, growth, together with increase in cost of health service delivery, particularly in relation to hospital admitted and non-admitted services, increase in expenditure primarily relates to employee-related costs and supplies and consumables. The increase in demand relates to additional emergency department presentations, additional overnight hospital admissions and additional attendance at outpatient specialist clinics. 

Again, you did not account for the health expenditure properly in the budget and now you are asking for more money. It was always going to happen. We have seen when it comes to health, an overreliance on things like locums, hundreds of millions of dollars on locums because of poor workforce planning, and lots of overtime. It is very costly because you have not led the health system in the way that is required to be efficient, to give Tasmanians the health care they deserve at their time of need. You have not accounted for it properly in your latest budget update either. I will be watching with interest when we have a budget this year whether you are actually accounting for Health expenditure properly or whether you are trying to fudge the figures like you do to end up with some mythical pathway to surplus that you never, ever get close to achieving because it is all built on dodgy assumptions.

Then we have a blowout in cost for the prison service. Maintaining sufficient levels of correctional staff has led to additional overtime requirements. Other cost pressures include the growth in the prison population, increases in workers compensation premiums and general prison expenses such as food and clothing. We know that there have been staff shortages, which often contributes to the overtime. Very poor workforce planning there. Some of these cost blowouts are entirely preventable, if we had a government that was leading these departments, preparing for the future, investing in the workforce to make sure that we do not have these stopgap measures all the time.

We know that too many workers are getting injured and we have significant costs there for injured workers in the Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management. I take my hat off to police officers and emergency service workers who often go to work, put their own safety at risk to keep the community safe and they need to be supported. If they are not supported, injuries unfortunately happen. Last time I spoke to people within police, I think one in 10 workers were on workers compensation, which is an extraordinary number of the workforce not being supported, being put into situations that may be avoidable, and then we are seeing this sort of support required. We are seeing a number of spends that are down to poor workforce planning, down to poor leadership when it comes to preparing the workforce and supporting them.

We are seeing the significant deterioration in the budget position. What is the response from this government after maintaining the facade that everything was okay for so long? I actually thought you were going to try and maintain that facade for a bit longer. They have had an efficiency dividend and we know from people like Saul Eslake that that leads to inefficiencies in the public service, a hiring freeze to help achieve some of that, I think, a review of the public service, and instead of making strategic decisions about the public service for service delivery to make it efficient and high quality, you have taken the lazy option. You have outsourced these decisions to unelected bureaucrats, and I feel sorry for the position that you have put them in. You have outsourced the problem. You cannot even tell us what an 'essential worker' is because you have left that to unelected bureaucrats to make those decisions. A hiring freeze is inefficient, it is lazy, and it will lead to poor decision making and poor service delivery.

You are not owning the problem. You have caused the problem, but you are not owning it. You are giving it to other people to deal with.

The other response that we see is a fire sale on that side of the House. They did not come to parliament with some formed-up proposals and try and sell the benefits. We have had the Premier repeatedly asked for examples where there have been benefits in the energy sector, for example, and he has not been able to back that in. We have seen a fire sale and it is history repeating, as I said from the outset.

This happened back in the 1990s and back in the 1990s, interest rates were much higher. It is going to be up to the Premier to try to explain to Tasmanians how selling assets that return significant dividends to the Tasmanian community to pay for schools and hospitals, how selling off those assets and selling off the future is going to be beneficial to have a debt offset account because, as Saul Eslake said in his first finances report, long-term interest rates are relatively low. The environment is a lot different back to the 90s and the early 2000s when the Liberal government was considering them at the time.

Significant contributions from some of these businesses, MAIB, for example, nearly $1 billion in returns in the past 10 years which funded very important public services. Things like the Road Safety Advisory Council, the State Emergency Services SES road rescue services, and over the last 10 years, we have seen $4 billion invested into services that Tasmanians care about because we have these great assets that Tasmanians have built over decades - hundreds of years, in some examples. Once they are gone, they are gone forever. We cannot get them back and if we do try to get them back, it is often at great expense.

I gave the example about the Liberals' privatisation of the rail service in Tasmania. We had a private company that bought and stripped the assets, under-invest in the infrastructure and then come back to the government years later and say, 'We want a $100 million to continue some of these services'. I think it was about a $100 million subsidy at the time. The government ended up having to buy it back and having to invest in all the infrastructure to fix up the infrastructure. We are still doing that because of that sale at the time. It was an essential service that Tasmanians relied upon in terms of freight movement.

It is a mistake. Once they are gone, they are gone, and these private companies move from a government business that has the public welfare at its heart, at its core, delivering a service for the economy, trying to grow the economy, trying to give services to Tasmanians at a reasonable rate to being driven purely by profit. The bottom line rules everything when it comes to privatisation. It means that services often go. It means that there are often question marks about competition and we have seen examples on the mainland where companies have been privatised and then the government ends up having to subsidise the price, or cost of services for consumers because they are over a barrel. There might be a monopoly or very little competition, and the private company can then start extracting a return, which is what they are designed to do, often at the expense of the consumer. Once these companies are privatised, we lose accountability.

I keep thanking the Health minister for her contribution last week where she talked about the Hobart Private Hospital and a board overseas - little connection to Tasmania making commercial decisions to reduce services that impact the community. That was maternity services, which is a huge issue for women, Tasmanian families and babies in Hobart. She was lamenting that a private service was making commercial decisions not in the best interests of the community because it had very little connection.

We have seen here in the last 12 months accountability play out. When you control these government businesses in public ownership, there is accountability. Under our Westminster system, we have elected members in this House who are responsible, and the buck stops with them. We have seen one minister in the last 12 months stand down from their commission because the parliament no longer supported them in that position.

We have also seen a response from the government in terms of reform to try to address some of the governance issues, and to make sure that these sorts of failures that we have seen, in terms of infrastructure delivery, do not occur again.

We would lose all of that under the Premier's fire sale. We would lose control over our own destiny in many of these sorts of services. That is the government's response to record deficits and record debt. The state's finances have never been in worse shape. The Treasurer, for example, lamented the former government's budget position in his speech. The finances are so much worse than they were back then. There was no net debt when the government changed hands. There was cash and investments in the bank. We are now heading to a pathway of $10 billion of record debt.

It will be more by the time we get there because, as I have outlined, they do not account for things properly. They have dodgy assumptions baked into the budget. The position will continue to get worse. The budget that they deliver this year will continue to get worse because they will not be able to account for their privatisation agenda. They will not be able to signal to the market what they think some of these assets are worth, so they will not be able to put it into a debt offset account.

You have the Premier all at sea talking about things that I think he does not know a lot about. He talks about some sort of future fund like it is an investment account. I think he is talking about cash sitting in a debt offset account rather than a future fund, which is an investment fund that aggressively seeks to get returns in the market. It is up to him to explain what he is talking about. I do not think he particularly knows at the moment because there is a very confusing message on that side of the House.

We have seen these sorts of supplementary appropriation bills in recent times because of the government's lack of ability to manage money and their lack of ability to forecast accurately, or their lack of political will to forecast accurately. We will continue to see these sorts of supplementary appropriation bills because this government is all at sea when it comes to managing Tasmania's finances.

[12.42 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I rise today to talk to the Appropriation (Supplementary Appropriation for 2024-25) Bill 2025 and indicate at the outset that the Greens will support it. There are some critically important services and indeed wages contained within this appropriation bill, and as a result, we will be supporting it. That is not without some strong criticisms of elements of how we got to where we are, and that is not without some deep concerns about elements contained within the budget. Before I speak to that, I acknowledge the departmental staff in the Chamber here today and thank them for the briefing on this. I found that incredibly informative in terms of unpacking the specifics that sit behind this supplementary bill.

Of course, we knew this was coming. The Revised Estimates Report came out just a month or so ago and shocked us all collectively with the scale of the changes that needed to be made, or needed to be recognised and incorporated into the bill that we passed through this place. An increased deficit of $500,000 to $1.3 billion; increased debt up by $328 million to $5.7 billion by the end of the financial year. That is going to take $500 million a year simply to service.

The scale of the crisis is really quite perplexing when you think that simply to service the debt that we are going to have racked up by the end of the year it will be $500 million, and indeed, it will be over that by 2028 when debt pops up to $9.6 billion. Saul Eslake has done some estimates about this with regard to forecasting the debt through into the next decade, and it is truly alarming as to what will happen there.

Mr Eslake has done his report into the government's finances, and the review held a number of different recommendations. I completely do not accept the Premier's articulation that some of those recommendations justify and bolster the proposition of selling government businesses, but Mr Eslake highlighted some concerning issues regarding our finances and made some constructive propositions. We need to be increasing revenue. He rejected outright efficiency dividends and vacancy controls as any kind of sensible or effective way to manage the budget. He put some really simple propositions on the table for parliament to consider, things like a parliamentary budget office. This is an office that can put out projections 10 years into the future that the parliament has access to. That has seemingly been rejected outright by the government in its response.

I will read into the Hansard some comments from Mr Eslake's report that speak a little bit to how we got here, because there is a lot of discussion about the impact of the pandemic and the impact of the commission of inquiry. We Greens absolutely acknowledge that they are issues and that they have exacerbated this crisis, but our present situation is not simply as a result of those shocks to our economic system. Mr Eslake has been very clear. Let me read into the Hansard what he wrote:

Tasmania's public sector finances have deteriorated significantly since the latter part of the 2010s - despite a noticeable improvement in Tasmania's economic fortunes, by many metrics, relative to the rest of Australia between about 2016-17 and 2021-22. That deterioration, best evidenced by the shift in all of the principal measures of the government's budget 'bottom line' from balance or surplus in the mid-2010s to persistent and (for the most part), growing deficits since 2018-19, and the government shift from net creditor throughout the 2010s to a net debtor from 2020-21 onwards.

This is the important bit:

These trends were partly attributable to the Covid-19 pandemic, and more recently to the need to provide compensation payments to survivors of child sexual abuse in State institutions. But they began before the onset of the pandemic, and have continued after it.

He is abundantly clear that it is policy decisions of this government that are creating this situation and indeed making it worse when we look at these kinds of responses. He explicitly mentioned raising more revenue. Why is it that in this state we are charging mining companies less than the national average for their rights to mine our resources? Why is it that we cannot raise more money and we are having to take a razor gang to the public service to try to rein in this level of spending?

I have to make the point, as did Mr Eslake, that there is simply no pathway to surplus in the budget. It is a complete and utter mirage. The Revised Estimates Report demonstrated that there is an ongoing deterioration in just about all of the aspects of our financial position, and that the pathway to surplus is completely made up.

Mr Barnett regularly references the net operating balance. That is bolstered, it has to be said, by not having capital expenditure in it. That net operating balance itself is trending pretty poorly. The net operating deficit is going to increase by more than $350 million across those forward Estimates, which is more than what is currently budgeted for. The balance looks better because of an upward revision of capital grants from the Commonwealth, even though it is for an infrastructure spend, not to pay for operational expenditure.

The pathway to surplus is a mirage and yet the backdrop to all of this - I think there are two backdrops to all of this that need to be clearly articulated. We have the worst health, education and housing outcomes of almost any state or territory in the country, depending on which metric you are looking at. It also has to be held up against the expenditure decisions in relation to a billion-dollar stadium at Macquarie Point, a stadium that was never referred to Treasury for their advice. It was never referred to the Premier's own Cabinet for consideration. It was certainly not referred to the Tasmanian people for their input. It is a billion-dollar stadium at a time when we can least afford it. We all want a footy team, of course, and we know the benefits that can bring to us as a state. However, to deepen this budget crisis, to add hundreds of millions of dollars on top of the debt burden already there is, at the end of the day, intergenerational theft. It will condemn our kids and future generations to having to address that for so very long.

The term I took from the Treasurer's speech was 'above budget'. I do not know how many times I heard him talk about 'above budget'. I completely understand that there are always things that will pop up that cost more than you budget for. However, it does beg the question about how the Treasurer is compiling his budgets in the first place when you have some of these issues so consistently arising and this parliament having to consider supplementary bills so regularly. It begs the question as to how this is going to be addressed in the coming budget.

Treasurer, I note that while we are dealing with a bill here for $467.5 million, the Revised Estimates Report actually talks to a $660 million-plus increase in expenditure. What I am taking from that is that the 'above budget' issues are not just the half-a-billion dollars we are dealing with in this bill, but actually $665 million, and some of that is being addressed in other mechanisms that do not need to come to this parliament. 

When it comes to 'above budget', if, in the space of six short months, as Mr Willie articulated, they are coming back to this parliament for another $500 million appropriation to inject into the budget, how on earth can people have any confidence with the stadium spend? How can we trust that this government can do what it says it wants to do for the amount of money it says it can do it with, when we know it is all smoke and mirrors, when there are so many elements that are unfunded? This includes the northern access road and the Collins Street bridge, for example. How are we going to fund these enabling elements of a project that pertain explicitly to the safety and the convenience of patrons? How are we going to get there, apart from GBE sales?

The member who has just resumed his seat spoke at length about GBE sales. The Greens, it seems, are on a similar page with the Labor Party about hostility to flogging public assets to plug the hole in the budget. We cannot have our treasured public institutions and assets being sold simply so that we can build and pay for infrastructure and elements we do not need. 

Let us also remember that it is not completely isolated to government businesses. Treasurer, we are still wrapping our head around this and you might, on summing up, be able to tell us a little bit about this: How is it that we can reach into the public service and pull out a part of it for sale, for example, the Land Titles Office? That is not a government business. It is not a state-owned company. It is an important part of government service that holds an incredible array of important personal information. It has been named as an entity that is going to be looked at for sale. We are interested in an explanation as to how that can be because, to us, it is not a business; it is a service. How on earth are you going to try and monetise that, and how do you take into account the risks that come with that?

To speak to the bill more specifically, there are elements that are completely understandable and elements that seem incompetent or skewed budgeting. To go through some of the line items one by one - and some of my colleagues are going to talk to these in more detail, when it comes to the Department of Education, Children and Young People (DECYP), I completely understand more money for the Advice and Referral Line, and welcome the fact that this is a service being taken up and embraced by the community. It is a shame there is that demand, but if there is the demand, we absolutely have to pay for it. 

Regarding out-of-home care and Ashley, we have been strong critics about the government's approach when it comes to helping our most vulnerable and troubled children and both the cruelty and illogical expense of Ashley Youth Detention Centre. I heard from my briefing - and this is across several of the sectors, Corrections and Police as well, this relates to workplace management, to occupational health and safety.  It relates to increased sick leave, increased insurance and increased workers compensation. I heard from my briefing, and perhaps the Treasurer, on summing up, could confirm this, that there are 16 staff currently suspended from Ashley Youth Detention Centre and that we are paying them while investigations are ongoing. That is understandable. However, can the Treasurer confirm that there are 16 staff currently suspended from Ashley?

When it comes to Health, yes, of course, we need health care. One of the parallel crises, along with the climate and biodiversity crisis, and challenges in our education and housing systems, is the state of the health system. We fully support additional resources going into this sector and this output. However, again it begs the question of how are we going to fix the problem that the government is underestimating, under-budgeting for the spend and demand on health? How are we going to get it right next time so that we do not have to come back to this place and ask for additional appropriation bills? 

We know we are one of the oldest, sickest populations in the country. Our healthcare costs are going to be high. They are going to grow. How do we make sure that the complexity of the cases we have coming forward and the recruitment challenges the health system is experiencing at the moment are properly considered in the next budget? Treasurer, we will be watching your first budget very carefully to make sure that some of these issues are properly addressed going forward, because it is not good enough. We understand sometimes coming back to this place to ask for more money for the out-of-the-box issues, but it seems to be happening more and more often.

When it comes to the Justice department, again this speaks to occupational health and safety - cost pressures impacting the prison service, difficulty attracting and maintaining levels of staff, workers compensation issues, leave issues and so forth.

This begs the question, or at least needs to be put alongside, the Tasmanian government's 'tough on crime' mantra: the question about prisons, and the question about the cost and the expense of prisons versus alternative, more therapeutic, more successful, I might say, opportunities to deal with these kinds of issues within our community.

Yes, we have to deal with crime, but it is really clear and it is clear in these budget papers and the explanation for them that a 'tough on crime' approach is just going to load up pressure on the system. It will load up pressure on its people and ultimately then load up pressure on the Tasmanian budget, because the department blows its own budget when it comes to the various cost pressures.

The Department of Natural Resources and Environment in Tasmania - minister, I would like you to address this. This supplementary appropriation is for $8 million. I appreciate that. It is provided to address an increase in operational costs in the National Parks and Reserve System. I noted from the -

APPROPRIATION (SUPPLEMENTARY APPROPRIATION FOR 2024-25) BILL 2025 (No 1)

Second Reading

Resumed from above.

[2.30 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, before lunch I was talking about the Parks output and highlighting that in this appropriation bill there is an $8 million provision for unfunded operational costs.

I was alarmed, and I know Ms Badger will talk about this more when she has an opportunity to talk to this, but I was alarmed in my briefing to hear that this was considered an ongoing deficiency when it came to the Parks budget and that the Parks budget had not been met consistently and we need top-ups. The supplementary bill has an $8 million figure, but if my memory serves me correctly - I do not have it on paper - the Revised Estimates Report itself has a $32 million figure against the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania (NRE Tas) and parks, which indicates that maybe the unmet operational element of their budget was $32 million as opposed to only the $8 million. Obviously, we are needing to come to the parliament for the $8 million - the $24 million is funded from some other way. Can you confirm that, Treasurer, as to whether it is from the Treasurer's reserve or where is that additional $24 million coming from with regard to Parks? 

We Greens have been making the point that for decades now that Parks are completely underfunded for its land management tasks. The tasks in the park space are getting ever more difficult with climate change with the invasive species, with humans who in ever increasing numbers are loving our parks, and at times loving them into problems. We fully support additional Parks funding. It is another note for the Treasurer to take away if this is an ongoing deficiency that the parks service consistently has to have addressed, then that is the situation you really need to deal with at budget time.

We want to get to a situation where our departments are properly funded in the budget each year and we are not having to come to the parliament for these top-ups, particularly when they are elements that are already in their budget submissions. If these are in their budget submissions and they are saying we need this money now and they are only getting half of it, it is hardly surprising and it is also completely unacceptable for them to have to come back and ask for more. Not only have they scrimped and saved and stressed for that whole period until they have actually got the confirmation of additional money, they are clearly not delivering as good outcomes in the parks themselves.

When it comes to police again, another OH&S type issue is in terms of additional money being needed, not only for workers compensation premiums but also the fact that this has been driven by an increase in the number of workers compensation cases and the increased complexity of those cases. Yes, we know that the working world is getting ever more complicated, difficult with challenges and there is no more difficult workplace than on the beat for a police person, but it does raise the issue about sustainability of that workforce, making sure we fund it adequately as well.

Premier and Cabinet got $11 million for the severe weather event. This is one of those things, Premier, that I will ask you here and now about how are you going to budget for this in the future? We know that climate change is driving more frequent, more extreme, more serious weather events. We have one in the north of the country at the moment and we have still one on the west coast with regard to our fires, but we are having these more frequent and extreme events. They deliver a shock to our economy, not only across the economy but to its people.

How is the government going to provision for these kinds of payments into the future? Will you have a severe weather event contingency fund built into the budget and into the future so that people know that if they are dealt by a bad hand by climate change through fire, flood or some other tempestuous incident - I will not say natural incident because it is human induced, but some other damage - that they know that the government is going to be good and able to help them out?

The rest of State Growth, I will let my colleagues speak to these in more detail with regard to the Dolphin Tungsten Mine, of Wine Tasmania and tourism packages, because that speaks more specifically to them. With regard to homelessness, and my colleagues will talk to this, obviously, strong support for Bethlehem House regarding their capacity to increase the services that they deliver to women in crisis.

With that, I only have a few minutes left. We, Greens, will support this Appropriation Bill. This money is needed to keep aspects of government going, but it really is a case in point and I guess as we approach a couple of months away before we have to sit down and go through the next Budget process with a new treasurer, it really points to some of the deficiencies in the budgeting process, and the ability of the Department of Treasury and Finance to properly consider other departments' budget requests and make sure that they are met.

The central issue here is the way we are managing our finances overall in terms of the debt and deficit challenge that is coming: the impost that we are putting on future generations, our children, their children, and the legacy that we are leaving them. We are not only a planet in crisis and an environment that is ever harder and more expensive to manage and recover from - not only are we leaving them a legacy that is diminished in that regard, but we are obviously leaving them a significant debt issue as well.

As we hit the doors for this federal election - we Greens are already out on the doors knocking with volunteers in support of colleagues - it is the same as this time last year in the Tasmanian context. People are looking at cost of living, the health crisis, the homelessness crisis, education results, and they are looking at budget bills like this and the government coming to the parliament with its hand out again to fund some of these services, and they are asking again and again, 'How can this be in the context of a Macquarie Point stadium? How can it be that we can build a Macquarie Point stadium at the whim of a major national sporting corporation? How is it that we can be dictated to build a stadium like this when we have these significant challenges within our budget and significant structural challenges within the services that Tasmanians need and deserve?'

We will always say we should be investing that money in those services to give Tasmanians everything that they need and deserve to succeed in the twenty-first century. 

[2.39 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to make a contribution on yet another supplementary appropriation bill that I have been here for. It reminds me of the other contributions that I have made throughout my time in this place around what is now a consistent pattern of behaviour from this government. 

I will go straight to budgeting. When the government announced their budget in September last year and we could see that they were planning to spend less on Health this year than they did last year, I knew this day was coming. Everyone knew this day was coming. The fantasy budget that we saw was so unlikely to ever occur that we all knew we would be here today. Even with a budget set down in September - already three months into the financial year - the government claims it had no idea that all of this Health expenditure would happen. This demand for our healthcare system seems to shock them every year, for 11 years in a row. It shocks them every time that there is increased demand for services in our healthcare system. It should not be surprising, and yet here we are.

The budget that gets handed down by the treasurer of the day, even three months into a financial year, is not worth the paper it is written on by the time we get to December and the revised Estimates report, which shows that they have massively overspent in Health because that is what they do every year.

The concern that we have around this is that we, the Tasmanian people, have not been able to see the true state of the budget because of the way that they have been budgeting. As we pointed out at the time last year, and particularly the shadow treasurer, Mr Willie, if you actually took them seriously and if the numbers they put down in that budget were real, then they would be cutting $600 million from healthcare services over the course of a four-year period. It is a massive amount.

They either had to make huge cuts to our healthcare system or they had to do what they have done, which is come back to the parliament and seek more money. They have done the latter, while at the same time also overseeing efficiency dividends which are also baked into the budget. I will come to that in a little while.

The problem with this budget situation, as I said, is that the numbers they provided were never going to happen. Because of that we are in this situation where we are asked to provide more money, and of course we will provide. We will support this as we always will, but what has been uncovered over the last 10 days is that the government has finally admitted that they have a massive financial problem. According to Saul Eslake's report, it is entirely a predicament they put themselves in. The policy decisions of this government are the reason we are in this position. It is entirely the Liberals' fault. It is them who decided to take Tasmania back into debt. In fact, they announced it. I think then premier and treasurer, Peter Gutwein, announced the plan to take Tasmania into debt. He stood in this place and announced it.

Yes, COVID happened, and absolutely, it was appropriate that the government spent more money during that time to keep Tasmanians safe and to keep our economy ticking over, but it is also not true to say that that is the cause for the situation we are in. The last three financial years have been the three largest fiscal deficits in Tasmanian history, and not by a little bit, but by a huge amount. This is post-COVID. These are the decisions they have decided to make themselves. The question that Tasmanians will be asking is: has anything actually improved?

I heard the former treasurer speak at the budget breakfast last year when he proudly proclaimed that we were spending twice as much on Health as we were 10 years earlier. I had not heard that said before and I immediately went to fact-check it. I got my phone out, looked at the budget from the current year and from 10 years earlier, and he was right. It is actually true. They are spending twice as much on Health as they did 10 years ago. The question I would ask about that is: has anything actually improved?

The waiting list is much the same. Ambulance wait times have blown out, and Tasmanians are telling me that they have less access to the health care that they need than they ever have before. If you are in regional Tasmania and you are looking for mental health support, it is really tough out there. I think everyone in this place will have spoken to people who have not been able to get the level of support that they have required. You have a budget which is blowing out. You have massive debt that is growing, and we get to this point where we are asked to support a supplementary appropriation bill, but also Tasmanians are being asked to support the sell-off of our assets to pay for it. 

Governments across the country have looked at asset sales, and interstate there have been two ways to do it. The first has been to talk about asset recycling, making a claim to people in that jurisdiction that by selling that particular asset it would allow the government to invest in something else. That happened in New South Wales in 2015. Mike Baird made that pronouncement. Then we saw what is happening in this particular instance, where the government is saying that we have built up so much debt and that our debt and deficits are now so out of control that the only way we can see to get out of it is to sell our assets - to sell Tasmanians' assets. Tasmanians will not stand for this approach. 

It probably should be put on the record that the so-called 'Strong Plan' appears to have disappeared in the last week. I do not think the Strong Plan was mentioned in the Premier's speech, and has not been mentioned this week in parliament. I think they have torn up the so-called Strong Plan and have a new plan that is about selling off assets to pay for their massive debt. This is not a debt that has been racked up by successive governments or by anyone other than one government: the Tasmanian minority Liberal government, and in particular, by one Premier.

This Premier has been here for three financial years and has overseen the three largest fiscal deficits in Tasmanian history. That is not a point of opinion; that is a point of fact. Tasmanians will be asking themselves: what has actually improved since this Premier took over and started running budgets like this?

Can you imagine what the Liberals would be saying if it was Labor handing down budgets like this? Can you imagine Guy Barnett, the now Deputy Premier, and the member for Franklin, minister Abetz, if Labor was handing down budgets like the ones that the Liberals have handed down for the last three years? Can you imagine the member for Braddon, Mr Ellis, if it was Labor handing down budgets like this? He would be apoplectic. It would be the end. He would be fighting against Labor budgets. What they have done is overseen the biggest deterioration in any state or territory's finances in Australian history. They have taken Tasmania's budget from having the strongest balance sheet when they came to government in 2014 to having the weakest. That is not just me saying that; it is Saul Eslake, who said that we are now on the way to having worse finances than Victoria.

It was only two years ago during budget time that we started raising concerns about the budget. Ms Finlay remembers. They started saying, 'Oh well, Labor is in government in Victoria and how bad would that be?' Guess what? They have made it worse here than in Victoria. That is what they have overseen. You have the worst finances in the country, according to Saul Eslake, who they have now employed. Moody's and S&P have come out and said that the finances are now credit negative, meaning that we are potentially on the way to a downgrade, and that impacts our ability to borrow and the amount of interest that we pay. That ability to borrow and the amount of interest we pay is really critical to services, and it is critical to Tasmanians.

With a trajectory of $10 billion worth of debt, the likelihood is that Tasmanians will be paying $500 million every year just to service the debt. You could double the number of teachers; you could scrap all payroll tax; you could do all sorts of things with that money. This is what happens when you have a government that puts all of its problems on the credit card. That is what they have done for three years. There has been no problem that this Premier has not thought he could buy his way out of.

They have spent Tasmanians' money to the point where we are now looking down the barrel of debt that is not going to be here just for the next year or the year after. I suspect we will still be standing here in 10 years' time - or some of us will be - and there will be members of parliament talking about the budget that was just handed down and the next budget, which we assume will probably be even worse. This is a legacy budget with which we are dealing. It is a legacy of Liberal Party debt which is going to be on the Tasmanian taxpayer now for decades to come. It is relatively easy, and they have shown how easy it is, to rack up $10 billion worth of debt, but it is going to take a lot of hard work to pay it back.

I am inspired by former Labor governments that have taken on this task from former Liberal governments, like in 1998 when we saw the Bacon government, along with David Crean and Paul Lennon, take to the task of repaying Liberal Party debt from 1998 onwards and finally get to the point where they paid off the debt in, I think, six years. Actually, it might have been a little longer than that. They did so by working hard at it, treating it like Tasmanians treat their mortgages. They understood that they needed to be cautious and careful and manage our finances well. That is what good governments do. Unfortunately, bad governments do what this government has done.

We have not just had a credit downgrade in terms of being credit negative. This government also took a AAA credit rating from Labor and already lost that some years ago. Now, we are looking towards being credit negative.

I also want to reflect on one of the comments made by the Deputy Leader of the Greens about the stadium. If the stadium ceased to exist as a proposition, the budget finances would be just as bad as they are now. I think you do the argument about the way that the government has mismanaged this budget a disservice by blaming the stadium on the government. I know that it is politically expedient for you to do that, but this budget is not broken because the government is proposing a stadium. They have not built a stadium yet. It would be in the situation it is in, exactly as it is, irrespective of any proposal to build a stadium.

The current cash deficits are over $1 billion per year, and in the context of the proposed investment in the stadium, to say that that is the problem is completely and obviously wrong. The problem has been their serious financial mismanagement.

Today's supplementary appropriation, though, must be seen through the prism of what we have been dealing with over the course of the last couple of weeks, which is the government's proposed asset sales. Contrary to what the Premier stated in Question Time today, Hydro is not the entirety of Tasmanian government dividends coming into the budget. In fact, the Motor Accidents and Insurance Board (MAIB) has had a very similar inflow to the budget as Hydro has, slightly under. It has been government businesses across the board, from MAIB to Hydro to TasNetworks to Aurora, that have been helping to support Tasmania's budget through additional revenue. It has been used by the Liberals through special dividends, through just standard dividends for years now.

The problem with their proposed asset sales is that they actually make the budget problem worse. When they look to do a 99-year lease on TasNetworks, that may provide a significant cash injection into the budget, but it will take away all of the money that would otherwise have been flowing into Tasmania's budget over the next 99 years. In order to pay down this Premier's debt, he will be taking a relatively small amount of money now but Tasmanians, over the next 99 years, cannot receive the same level of dividends they have been receiving for at least the last decade, since the split of Hydro into the three entities.

Regarding privatising MAIB, when you speak to people in the insurance industry about MAIB, as Mr Willie and I did just before Christmas, they were lauding the outstanding framework that MAIB provides to the Tasmanian public. It is the best model anywhere in Australia for the work that it does. The proposal to scrap it, to tear it up, to take a short-term sugar hit of cash, instead of allowing it to continue to do the great work it does, is a shocking and terrible idea. It is not something we will support. We support having a MAIB that is there when the public needs it. MAIB is providing the level of support to Tasmanians at their worst time, but also providing a level of support that is relatively inexpensive compared with other states and territories. Last week, we outlined the issues regarding the price of car registration in the ACT, Queensland and New South Wales. In the ACT, car registration is twice as much as it is here. These are products of continuing the public ownership of these assets, the public ownership of which has led Tasmania's economy to grow.

Our four major industrials in this state are under a lot of pressure at the moment, and some of them are more public than others. Over the last little bit, GFG Group in South Australia has, unfortunately, had huge financial problems. There are concerns about the flow-on effect of that to other parts of the operation. We have seen the Boyer paper mill being sold off. It is really important to the community in the Derwent Valley, but also across the state, that the operation be able to continue, but with an ownership switch, there is always uncertainty. At the zinc works, we have seen the cancellation of a major capital project, which I think everyone in this place would have loved to see go ahead. There is also always pressure on all the major industrials around power prices and availability.

However, the reason those four major industrials are here today is because of the public ownership of our energy assets, not just the Hydro. It is because of the public ownership of TasNetworks, which has allowed us to keep the transmission costs for those businesses relatively low. Once the government sells, or does a 99-year lease and privatises TasNetworks, it will not be able to make those sorts of strategic decisions that governments in Tasmania have been on board with for decades. Every Tasmanian government until this one - and the one in 1998, I should add, understood why public ownership of these energy assets was critical. They also understood why the concept of Tasmanian prices for Tasmanian power was critical, until this one.

Tasmanians do not believe that privatising Metro is going to let their buses run on time. Just because this government cannot make the buses run on time, does not mean that any competent government could not. We believe that it is appropriate that Metro stays in public hands and we believe that a competent government can manage these assets. Metro has been on temporary service cancellations for two years - 180 services for more than two years.  The government's response to that is to say, 'Well, we are going to sell it'. That is the only way they know how to fix it. 

They could not build a berth at Devonport for our two new Spirits and their response to that is to say, 'Well, it has made us reflect on the nature of public ownership of these assets, so we are just going to sell it'. Labor wants to fix these things; the Liberals want to sell these things. We want to fix it and make sure that Tasmania's tourism sector has a bright future with a TT-Line that is there to back them with day sailings when they need it, with pricing when they need it and allow Tasmanians to see the rest of the country. That is put at risk by the government's plans. The budget is put at risk through the loss of dividends and Tasmanians are put at risk by higher prices for public transport, access to the mainland and power prices.

This government has put Tasmanians at risk through this plan. The Strong Plan was torn up last week and I welcome that. However, the new plan appears to be even worse. Selling off Tasmania's future to pay down Jeremy Rockliff's debt is wrong. We will not allow it to occur.

[2.57 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak to this supplementary appropriation bill. It is the first one I have been able to speak to. I find it extraordinary that only after such a short period of time - I know the budget was delayed, but it was only a handful of months ago, and here we are with a request from the Treasurer to provide more funding. It is not just a small amount to make ends meet, but a significant amount. It is almost half-a-billion dollars. The request is for $467.5 million. This was not reflected in the September budget. I would like to know if these are just attributed to those few months we have had since then. This is a significant hike to the public debt to fund these areas. 

The areas we have before us in this supplementary appropriation bill include funding for DECYP and the Tasmanian Home Builder Grant, which is $180 000. There is Department of Health funding for health demand and service requirements, Mental Health and Wellbeing. We see the response to the commission of inquiry and claims for child sexual abuse in state care, for the prison service and Department of Natural Resources and Environment. We also look at support for injured workers with an amount of $14.5 million, which seems an incredible shortfall. I would like to hear from the Treasurer why this is such a large figure in such a short period of time and why it was not recognised earlier in the budget. Was the budget an underfunding situation or has this only occurred since that time? That is a significant amount for compensation for injured workers. 

Mr Bayley talked extensively about the severe weather event. That $11 million for the severe weather event in August and September was a necessary intervention but, as Mr Bayley has said, these will be happening with greater regularity. How do we get ahead of the curve and recognise that we need to respond a lot more effectively so that this is not a continuous strain on the budget? It is difficult to think that we can just continually hand out money in these times of need which will be coming up more and more frequently.

There is money for the former Bethlehem House, so there is more support for women facing homelessness, which is a good thing. 

I am curious to know, Treasurer, about the $8 million in relation to Tasmanian Railway Pty Ltd, which has been provided 'to meet the government's commitment to increase the below rail infrastructure contribution to TasRail'. I suspect that might be in response to the Australian government's announcement about bringing forward $15.6 million of funding for the Tasmanian Freight Rail Revitalisation Tranche 4, which was announced in March. It would be good to know exactly what that is used for. 

I might add that the federal government has committed to an over $200 million boost to southern Tasmanian roads, and a lot of that is for active transport routes across the south-east of the state. It would be interesting to know what sort of commitment the state government has to building active transport routes and delivering on their promises.

I have some questions about why these were not listed in the budget paper and why the government is not considering walking away from other spending commitments that our state cannot afford. I will mention the stadium, because I think it is important to recognise that the stadium will be an ongoing drain on our state's finances. It will be an incredible drain that will serve as intergenerational debt. I think that is of huge concern, and for Labor to try and push that away as a non-issue shows the blind spot that Labor has in relation to this as much as the government does.

If we compare this supplementary appropriation bill to expenditure in three previous financial years: in 2019-20 there was a supplementary expenditure or appropriation of $405 million. That went up to $442 million in 2021-22, which was mostly because of a stimulus with the COVID response. In 2022-23, we saw $340.5 million as a supplementary expenditure and $163.4 million for Homes Tasmania. These are significant amounts of money in a very short period of time, which is of concern in terms of how well the government is really managing the finances of this state. It is a big question mark. 

It is a bigger question mark when you think about the forward Estimates. I believe that Mr Willie suggested it was $9.64 billion of debt, and that debt will need to be serviced. It will cost more to service that loan, as we know, and we know that the impact is both a greater cost but also a reduction and a downgrading of the state's credit rating. There are huge concerns for the generations to come. The lack of care and lack of prudence of the state government is very telling. It is incredible to think that there is such a lack of concern when it comes to how public money is spent. 

Then we get to last week and how the government might address some of this overspending. The government announced that it would be tightening its belt a notch by selling off our public institutions, trying to privatise those public institutions at the same time as putting fear into the hearts of public servants across the board. All public servants should be aware that their jobs may be on the line. The way that the government is approaching this is of huge concern.

We need a different approach to the one the government is currently providing. The Liberal government is not showing the financial restraint that is required. They are not thinking about the longer term picture, the responses to climate change, the responses to servicing that huge amount of debt that we, as a state, the taxpayers, the community, the people of Tasmania incur with this rather taciturn approach to managing the finances.

Whilst we support this, the Greens do have significant concerns in relation to how this budget is being managed.

[3.08 p.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Deputy Speaker, I rise this afternoon to speak on this supplementary appropriation bill. It is a really great opportunity to highlight again how poorly this government has managed Tasmania's finances, now over 11 years. As others have said before me, it feels like a light bulb moment for them in this last week where we finally see the Premier admitting that he has a problem with the state budget. It is a problem that can be attributed to this Premier and the last three financial years of which he has been the Premier and overseen budget deliberations, formation and delivery, and subsequent management of that budget over that period of time.

It feels, from the Premier's speech last week, that he is almost in like what we call a 'parallel universe', because he is the Premier of the day and he has been in government for 11 years yet he only just appears to have discovered the problems that he has created and that his Liberal minority government have created. He talks about the business environment, that it is too hard to get things done; the regulatory environment that this government has created. He also did not mention that regulatory review and reform has been on this government's agenda pretty much from day one. When we look, first, at planning reform, which the government has failed miserably; the planning scheme is not faster, it is not simpler, it is not cheaper. It is anything but. You can ask your local council or your average Tasmanian on the street who puts a planning application into their council for approval. It has made it more complex.

When you look at regulatory planning, the more you review it, the more complex it becomes. The problem is they have not done the strategic work that aligns that regulatory reform process as well. That in itself has held back housing growth, the rezoning of land, and is responsible for the problem that this government has when it comes to Tasmanians not having a roof over their heads and not having delivered the housing stock that is required across our state or even, in fact, enabled the private housing development that is required across our state. It all links back to this government's mismanagement of reform processes or inability to deliver reform through process and its inability to manage a budget.

With this bill that is before us today, it is absurd to think that ministers would be coming back to the Treasurer, to the government, less than six months into a budget process, asking for more money on arguably things that could have been looked at as part of a budgetary process. Others have talked in this place about that process and how the government, like all things with this government, is about front, PR, and spin. You can see that through the accounting methods that they use in their budget to processes and the fact that you have key things here that are operational expenses. I think it was our leader, Mr Winter, who said when we looked at the budget during the budget briefings, before the budget was handed down, about the fact that the government had underfunded health that it was only going to be a matter of time before the government came back and asked for more money for health. It is extraordinary to think that they would come back less than six months and be asking again.

There are things in here that are just day-to-day operations, like in our prison services. Any responsible minister would know that there are staffing shortages and that there would be the need for additional funding for that. You have to ask the question about what these ministers are doing: what the Expenditure Review Committee of government is doing when it looks at preparing the budget for the Tasmanian people.

A budget might be just a series of numbers on a piece of paper but it actually tells a story. What this set of numbers on this page tells us in this Chamber today is a story of a government that has not managed Tasmania's finances well. It tells the story of a government, and this is backed up by eminent economist, Saul Eslake, that has put party before Tasmanians each and every time. It tells the story of the government whose policy decisions that have been taken and made, have direct economic consequences for Tasmanians, an impact on the Budget and that they are solely responsible for those decisions. That is why Tasmania is in the mess that it is in today.

I want to touch a little bit on a couple of resets that these governments had. Quite often you will hear the government talk about its poor budget position being related to COVID, to the commission of inquiry. I want to put on the record, our support for the additional funding that was provided during those times. You only have to read the report by Saul Eslake, which clearly highlights that we were on the downward slide before that, when it comes to our budget position, through the decisions taken and made by this government.

You only have to look at the reset after COVID. We had PESRAC. We do not hear a lot about that anymore. PESRAC (Premier's Economic and Social Recovery Advisory Council) was outlined. It was the signature policy position outlined in a state of the state by the then premier and treasurer, Mr Gutwein. We did not hear anything more about that. Regulatory reform featured a lot again in PESRAC. We have not heard much about that since until the Premier's state of the state speech last week. Then we had no berth for the Spirit IV to berth at in Devonport, we had the PR exercise of the review of GBEs and that proposal of a merger of GBEs, but we have not heard a lot about that since either. It appears now that the next step before we have even looked at whether we want to merge GBEs in Tasmania, we are now going to sell them off.

It is just from one thing to the next and there is no consistency. Is it any wonder that we see the government come back in less than six months asking for more money, when they cannot even manage their own political processes, one might say, let alone the state's finances?

I wanted to take the opportunity to speak about a number of the initiatives that are included in the supplementary appropriation bill. Obviously, the first one I want to speak about is health. I took some time to go back and have a look again at the wait list across the state. Overwhelmingly, the story that this set of numbers tells you is that Tasmanians are not getting better health services for the money that is being spent. Health outcomes are not improving in Tasmania under this government. You only have to look at their ban on ambulance ramping. Ambulance response times in the state have not reduced under the ambulance banning decried by this government. They are still at about 15 minutes. That service has not improved for Tasmanians.

Then you only have to look at the ever growing list of specialist wait lists across the state. There are 62,000 Tasmanians waiting to see a specialist of some sort, and you know what that means? When people are waiting longer to see a specialist, they get sicker, so they end up in hospital. They end up presenting to our emergency departments. This is an area that we have seen absolutely no deliberative action from this government in reducing specialist waitlists in this state. That is why health expenses go up, because you have more sick people living with chronic disease in the community who are presenting to their GP, who are wanting specialist advice and support in the care that they are providing to their patient, and they cannot get in to see a specialist. Is it any wonder that costs are increasing? 

It would be interesting to know how much we have spent on locums and agency staff as at the beginning of this financial year. I was shocked when we went to the new maternity unit at the North West Private Hospital, which has now been taken back by the state government, to learn that 70 per cent of the midwives there were agency staff.

The root cause of a lot of these problems in this expense comes directly from the inaction of this government. It comes from having had no dedicated reform in education in the state. Education will lift health outcomes and productivity in the state; it will increase participation. Ultimately, these are the levers that need to be pulled and the reforms that need to take place to actually see genuine changes and outcomes for Tasmanians: those things that over time will improve budget position.

It should not really come as any surprise to the Chamber that we are asking for more money for Health. It is the rhetoric of this government time and again that they are spending more on Health, but things are not getting better for Tasmanians. 

I want to put a couple of remarks on the record about ambulance response times, which have not improved through the ban on ambulance ramping. I also want to talk about some of these wait times. If you have a child who needs to see an ear, nose and throat specialist in the south of the state for an urgent appointment, they are waiting 388 days.

Sometimes it has been difficult for people to get in to see a child health nurse as well due to the shortages of child health nurses across the state, but that means that that child will then perhaps go on to have developmental delays or learning difficulties at school. These are all things that should be addressed in those early years before children are attending school, but this is an opportunity that is not being afforded to Tasmanian families and Tasmanian children, and that is a disgrace. That is the human face of the situation that we find ourselves in in Tasmania.

The next thing I want to speak about that is part of this appropriation bill is about mental health services. Others in this place have commented on this, but mental health services across Tasmania are at crisis point. I am not diminishing the important role that child health nurses play in providing services across Tasmania - please do not get me wrong; they are very skilled professionals who provide outstanding care to families across our state and to children - but when you hear that in a proposal for a mother-baby unit there are not going to be staff who have perinatal mental health specialist experience, there is something desperately wrong.

Sitting through the hearings of our maternity services inquiry, I heard how devastating it is when families and parents - new parents in particular - cannot get access to the perinatal mental health services that they need, and the ongoing impact that that can have on children, families and women, including their ongoing participation in the workforce. A whole raft of economic flow-on consequences arise from that. There is not enough short-term mental health inpatient support in this state for Tasmanians, and you can see that it contributes to the homelessness problem that we have in Tasmania, where there are not the services available for people who are sleeping rough who have other issues related to mental health and wellbeing. You see it every day in Tasmania.

When you do not have adequate services in the community, you get people presenting to emergency departments, and that is where this additional money is being spent as well, because we are not providing the services for mental health and wellbeing across our community that support people so that they do not have to present in crisis at an emergency department across our state.

I spoke a little bit about the Department of Justice. What minister worth their salt would not be looking, when they put forward their position for the budget, at the things that they want to see included in the budget from their ministerial responsibilities? You have decreasing staffing levels and you are going to need more funding for staffing. It is crazy that this would come back in three months after that process occurring in government.

Special care packages that support children are also increasing. We hear about some of the issues that are arising in supported accommodation across the community. There needs to be some attention from the government to make sure that those young people are supported within those facilities, but also that the communities around them are supported to enable those young people to be provided with care in those communities.

There is more money for the Advice and Referral Line, which is very important. We would not begrudge that, but surely you would know when you were looking at your Budget Estimates that you would be requiring additional funding for that as a responsible minister? The same can be said for the Ashley Youth Detention Centre. 

It is very important to provide ongoing support for our Police, Fire and Emergency Management staff with increasing workers compensation claims, but that is not a new issue for this government either. We have been coming to this place asking questions about that for years; ever since I have been here. 

With Parks, we have severe weather events, which are becoming more and more common. It is putting more and more pressure on the budget and we are having to see more support provided to the community, which is appropriate and should happen, but perhaps there needs to be some insight into how that is included in a budgetary process so they are not one-off payments all the time, and the government is not having to come back to the parliament seeking approval.

I am also interested to know more about the $10.5 million for the mine on King Island, Treasurer.

There is $4.5 million for a tourism and hospitality support package, which is absolutely critical. We have spoken this morning about the detrimental effect the delays to the Spirit of Tasmania IV have had on regional tourism and small business right across Tasmania, but nowhere more than in the north-west of the state. Whilst this is great, it would be good if we had a berth and had everything in chain to be able to berth the ships when they got here. It would be good if they were not delayed and businesses could benefit from them. Instead, we have a support package included in response to another failing - perhaps the most significant failing of this government to date other than the budget position itself - the Spirit of Tasmania ferry fiasco.

The women in crisis accommodation initiative is really important but, once again, I need to understand why that has come to this place outside a budget process. If the Treasurer could outline that, that would be good.

There is more funding for Wine Tasmania. It seems odd that that would not be included originally in the budget. There are also the HomeBuilder Grant payments. Further explanation around that would be good.

In the time that I have been here, we have seen the state's finances deteriorate significantly. Saul Eslake, in his report on Tasmania's finances, quite clearly says that this government, when it had the opportunity, squandered the good times. When there was an opportunity to perhaps make some more bolder reforms when the state's finances were in a position to do that, the government did not do it. It squandered that opportunity, and hence we find ourselves in the position that we do today. With the privatisation agenda the government is now rolling out, nothing is off the table. We are not going to see those dividends coming in to support education and health, and we know that there is a desperate need for additional funding in those areas. You only have to look at this bill to see that. What is going to happen to the specialists' waitlist if we privatise our GBEs and we have no dividends coming into the state coffers to assist with providing those services? I am worried about what that means for Tasmanians. 

I am also worried about what it means to lose control of those government business enterprises. Arguably, what has transpired with TT-Line, TasPorts and the ferry fiasco is ultimately about ministerial accountability and the role a minister should play in managing their portfolio and ensuring things are delivered as intended; that they diminish those risks and economic risks that monumental failures like the Spirit of Tasmania ferry fiasco cause to this state. As an island state, with TasPorts, for example, we should have absolute control over our ports because if something goes wrong, that is our lifeline. 

It has been my pleasure to provide a few comments on this appropriation bill this afternoon and I hope to glean some more answers from the Treasurer.

Time expired.

[3.28 p.m.]
Dr BROAD (Braddon) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to make comments on the Appropriation (Supplementary Appropriation for 2024-25) Bill 2025. I think this bill is a massive admission from the government that it is incompetent and has lost control of the budget. I will go through and explain those comments during my contribution. 

We see a government having to go back to the well for $467.5 million some four months after the budget was first laid down. This is a massive amount of additional spending that the government has not accounted for. This is after a series of budgets that showed we were on track for the situation we are in now, which is debt and deficits off into the distance. The government's rhetoric has been that the debt is manageable and there is a pathway to surplus. What they have not done until very recently is acknowledge there is a problem when there have been so many instances where it should have been obvious to them that there is a budget problem, and it is a budget problem of their own making.

We saw this government slip into cash deficits in their budget a number of years ago and then pretending there was a surplus. That was based on accounting rules that allow the state government to take money from the federal government for big infrastructure projects and not have to count the spending. That artificially boosted the budget bottom line, but it did not solve the cash deficit problem. We saw the debt slowly building up, then that debt position accelerate. The government finally appears to be realising there is a problem and coming up with desperate measures. 

We should see this appropriation as a desperate measure. This whole supplementary appropriation, when you look through the detail, is an admission of failure. You just have to go through the detail and realise that this government cannot budget and does not solve problems. As a result of the government not solving problems, they have to come up with additional expenditure. 

One of the biggest, which the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Winter, talked about was Health budgeting. What we see year in, year out is the government pretend in their budget that health spending for the following budget year will be less than what they spent in the previous year. All you have to do is go to page 203 of Budget 1 and you see it on the table. You see that the budget for Health in 2023-24 was $2.9 billion, whereas the preliminary outcome, the actual spending in 2023-24 - it was their actual spending because the budget was late, was $3.38 billion. In other words, they overspent the budget by approximately $500 million. Over the space of a year, there was extra spending in health of half-a-billion dollars. They miscalculated their Health budget by half-a-billion dollars. However, the following year they said that they were going to spend less than they spent the year before. They have said that in the year 2025-26 they would be spending less than what they actually spent in 2023-24. It is just not plausible. That is not how the Health budget works. The Health budget just continues to grow, and this government is doing nothing about the inflation in the Health budget.

Many speakers in the budget session pointed out that the government is massively under-budgeting in Health. There were two choices: either the spending was going to blow out or they were going to have to sack people. There were no other choices. We are seeing now that it has come to pass: that the Health budget has blown out by $345 million only since the budget was brought down. How much is it going to be by the time we get to the end of the financial year? They are going to be making record above-budget expenditure in the Department of Health.
We know health demand and service requirements are not going down. They are going up. We will see the same old charade, we will come to the budget next year and the government will pretend once again that, miraculously, in the next year's budget, they are going to spend less than they are spending this year, and we will have to go through this whole process again. That highlights the way this government's budget works. It is a mirage. The debt figure: we are building up to $10 billion over the forward Estimates. We know that is an underestimate. The budget says it is approaching $10 billion, but we know that at the rate at which the Health department, the health sector alone is blowing out of control, that $10 billion of debt is going to blow out even more.

The government is failing to acknowledge there is a budget problem. We have credit rating agencies now saying our outlook has gone from stable to negative, but the government still pretends there is a pathway to surplus. How they can say that with a straight face, I do not know. It is beyond the pale. 

There are other problems this government is not addressing. As well as not addressing demand in the Health department, they are not talking about efficiencies. In fact, the projects in the Health department that may deliver efficiencies, like the IT upgrades; the government is getting so desperate with health budgeting that it is taking that money from the IT upgrades and putting it into operating. The idea that the Health department could become more efficient in the way that it manages patient flow and IT systems is out the door. Maybe they will have to put that into the next budget. All the areas where they could potentially improve services and efficiency, the money has had to go into operating. 

They still rely on locums and agency nurses. I assume that part of that is because of the instability in the Health budget. They can rely on locums and agency nurses because they are short-term, so they do not have to necessarily budget for them. They can ask for the money further down the track whereas, if they employ somebody full time they have to budget for those people across the forward Estimates. It seems like it is much easier from a budget sense to pretend that everything is fine in the Health department if they continue to rely on locums and agency nurses, who cost way more than employing that same person, that same profession on a full-time basis. It is just insane.

The other items being appropriated for include an extra $14.1 million for out-of-home care and $4.1 million for youth justice, the Ashley Detention Centre. Why is this happening? It is because Ashley is still open, because the solutions they are putting in place are not working and are expensive. They are not actually fixing the problem. The result is the government needs to find an extra $18 million for a problem that is not getting better. It beggars belief. How much of this extra $4.1 million for Youth Justice and Ashley Youth Detention Centre is paying for the staff who appear to be on permanent leave? They cannot go back to work. 

There are issues that resulted from the findings from the commission of inquiry. There are many workers who are being paid and not showing up to work. Is that the reason why - and I hope that the Treasurer, who has just left the room, will answer that question. Is that extra $4 million blowout in the Ashley Youth Detention Centre based on the fact that they are paying all these employees to not show up? Obviously, they have to backfill those positions. Is that why we have a $4 million blowout in the Ashley Youth Detention Centre? 

This is going to continue because government is not fixing the problem. The solution we have is minister Jaensch on the job to push it out further down the track and not actually solve the problem. The operating deficits are now four times worse than at the height of COVID. Is that not insane? What we see if we go down the list, the cost blowout is $25 million to address Tasmanian Prison Service cost pressures. $25 million is a lot of money for the prison service. Why do they need $25 million only four months after the budget was handed down? If it was two and a half million dollars, you would be thinking it maybe is overtime, but $25 million to address Tasmanian Prison Service cost pressures? The government needs to give a fuller explanation as to why so much money is needed when the budget was only brought down late last year.

We see $14.5 million to support injured workers in Police, Fire and Emergency Management. There is a workers compensation crisis going on in the Police department. There are so many police now on workers compensation that the government has to come and ask for another $14.5 million to support injured workers. Injured workers should always be supported and the Labor party will always support injured workers. The question is why are these workers getting injured in the first place?

There are solutions like we have talked about in this place before for police, things like addressing their issues. The police have been complaining about the way that their rosters put pressure on them, and basically the police get to about mid-career and then they quit. Now we see that there is a whole heap of them that suffer mental injuries because this government will not fix their rostering service. Why will not they fix their rostering service? It is because it will cost them extra money.

Instead of budgeting for the extra money to fix the rosters so the police do not have reduced workplace stress, they completely ignore the problem. They run a very successful trial, ignore it because it costs more and instead have to come and ask for $14.5 million dollars to support injured workers. That is a lot of support for a lot of injured workers and this is something else that the government is simply not fixing. It is incredible.

Not fixing Ashley costs more money. Not fixing issues in the health system costs more money. Not fixing the workers compensation crisis we are seeing in Police, Fire and Emergency Management costs more money. This is where the government completely fails. They are not managers; they do not manage. While not actually admitting it and saying they have caused this massive budget crisis, what we heard from the Premier's state of the state is a desperate privatisation plan that will make the budget problems even worse. How will it make the budget problems even worse? 

They have talked about their plan to right-size the public service, and they are pretending that a hiring freeze will do that. A hiring freeze will not get rid of the two and a half thousand public servants that this government is planning to send to the dole queue. It will not be cheap. You cannot simply get rid of two and a half thousand public servants without having to pay redundancies. Where are you going to get the money for the redundancies? The Premier put a figure on it. He said that there are two and a half thousand public servants who have to go. This government is going to have to pay for the redundancies and what it is going to result in is poorer services.

I can guarantee you that this government cannot 'right-size', in their words, the public service by two and a half thousand people unless there is a mass exodus of people, public servants saying, 'I have had enough, they are walking'. That is the only way a hiring freeze could reduce the public service by two and a half thousand people. Would that be a good outcome? Absolutely not, because people will no doubt leave from the areas of greatest need.

What is their strategy? They have not quite admitted there is a problem, but they have tried to come up with a very rash solution, which is this fire sale that they are talking about. Everything except Hydro is up for grabs to fill a budget black hole. Will that fix the budget black hole? No, because this government is still driving cash deficits. It is still driving cash deficits. Even if they do pay off some of the debt or stick it in an offset account, they are blowing the budget year in, year out.

The problem with the budget is not necessarily the budget numbers itself, it is the trajectory. It is where this budget is headed. It is well and truly out of control. We are seeing supplementary appropriations earlier in the financial cycle and they are getting bigger. The deficits are getting bigger in the budget and the supplementary questions, the budget blowouts are getting bigger and all the money is going to be borrowed. What we are seeing is interest on interest and we are getting into that debt spiral that we have been warning about for years. We have been warning about this for years. Treasury warned about this years ago in their fiscal sustainability report saying that the lack of early action will result in bigger problems down the track, and that is exactly what we are seeing.

What about their fire sale, the MAIB? There is no way that if the government sold the MAIB that they would ever get the returns that the MAIB has delivered in the past. They have delivered dividends, they have even delivered special dividends, but also, they have supported the vital work of community organisations, the road safety taskforce, and so on. It has also kept registrations much lower than other states. If someone comes in and buys the MAIB, there is no doubt that the government will be able to - I am not sure how they would do it. Whether they would take all the funds that the MAIB have invested to pay for claims, whether they get to keep that and get the sale of the MAIB. They might get a double whammy, but what that will do is push - you will never get the same return by investing that money and you will never be able to keep registrations as low as they are because you have completely lost control. That is the same with the Spirits. It is just amazing that the government, and especially the Premier, minister for Tourism, will not rule out selling the Spirits, selling the TT-Line. 

We heard the minister stand up in the matter of public importance today. It was pretty obvious that he does not realise how important the Spirits are for the Tasmanian tourism industry and they are vital for the Tasmania tourism industry in a number of ways. The most important one, apart from bringing the tourists into the state and bringing the freight in and out of the state, is that they actually put a floor in the market for anyone else coming into the state. The minister got up and said, 'Well, hello, don't you realise that the majority of tourists come into the state on an aeroplane?' By the way, the state, through TasPorts, owns the Devonport Airport and Burnie Council owns the Wynyard Airport, but do not worry about that.

It actually means that if the airline's charges for flights get out of control, then people have another option. They can get on the Spirits to come to Tasmania and they can bring their car. That has always put a floor in the market for tourists because they can make the decision about whether they are going to fly and hire a car, or bring their own car across in the Spirits of Tasmania. That is also why it is so important to get the Spirits IV and V on the run because then more tourists can come into the state. More tourists will have that option to choose whether they fly into the state or take the ferry. That is why it is vital for the tourism industry that we have, in effect, the Spirit of Tasmania setting a benchmark price. Otherwise, the airlines could charge heaps more especially if we have airlines that are struggling at the moment, so it is vital from that perspective, but it is also vital for the freight sector.

It is vital for two reasons. Once again, it puts a floor in the market because if these bigger Spirits arrive you can put containers and caravans as well on any deck. That means that there is that freight capacity to again put a floor on the price of freight across Bass Strait. If you put that into private hands, that means they can charge whatever they like and as a result Toll and SeaRoad can charge more. When it is in control of the state, the state can, in effect, control the prices. Vitally, the Spirit of Tasmania provides a very important service for industries like the salmon industry and the berry industry. There has been massive growth in the berry industry in Tasmania simply based on having that last-on first-off service that the Spirits provide. 

These new Spirits, which should be here already and should be operating, would allow for a further massive increase in the berry sector, which has been an economic driver for regional Tasmania and a jobs boom. We would like to get more Tasmanians working picking the berries, but there are also other jobs involved in the industry and it has been a real money spinner for us. The new Spirits provide greater access to markets, but if you put that into private hands, then instead of sitting there and watching the industry grow, they can think about how much they can actually get out of the industry. That is another vital role that the Spirits play. 

It is pretty obvious that the minister did not understand that and he just thought, 'Well, everyone is coming in on planes. Sell TT-Line'. That is the sort of thinking that is getting desperate. There is a fire sale underway at the moment. Everything is up for sale except the Hydro. The debt situation that this state faces is not manageable. There is no pathway to surplus. We have a government who cannot budget. They are blowing the Health budget every year. They are not solving the problems that are right in front of them staring them in the face that everyone lets them know about, and as a result, it costs them more money, and they have to keep coming and doing these supplementary appropriations instead of fixing the problems of their own making. It is a shame.

[3.48 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to give my contribution on the Appropriation (Supplementary Appropriation for 2024-25) Bill 2025. I will be brief. I do not want to unduly delay the inevitable with this bill, but I think it is important to put on the record some of my frustrations regarding this bill. It will come as no surprise to those in the House and to those in the community that I am deeply concerned about this government's budget position and their financial management. I see us falling very quickly off a cliff when it comes to financial management, if we have not already fallen off the cliff and rapidly approaching the bottom.

I want to go through some of the items that are outlined in this appropriation bill and talk about them in the context of the fact that it is a bill substantially to fund increased demand due to government policy failures. We see this repeated time and time again. Many of the things that are funded in this bill are things that are not surprising. They are things that could have been foreshadowed and they are the result, as I say, of serious government failure. That needs to go on the record because we get asked time and again to come back and fund supplementary appropriation amounts when the government should have a proper handle on what is happening with its finances, a proper understanding of service delivery and demand and what it is costing them, and a proper understanding of what community needs and expectations are. However, they continue to somehow come up with budget papers that have no reference to what is happening in reality, and that is deeply disturbing.

I want to talk firstly about the agency of Department of Education, Children and Young People, run by the Minister for Children and Youth. There are two quite serious concerns that I have regarding appropriation for out-of-home care and the youth justice system. An amount of $14.1 million is provided in this bill for out-of-home care to support an increase in the number of children accessing special care packages and an increase in the cost of these packages.

I do not want to begrudge this important funding that is needed for this area, but it indicates a failure of government policy to properly protect and look after the children of Tasmania if we keep having to increase funding for out-of-home care. I would hope that one day we wake up to a Tasmania where out-of-home care is not needed, where our children are loved and supported and are provided the best opportunities possible to thrive in Tasmania, but what we continue to see is a failure of the government to address child safety matters and to properly address those challenges facing families and young people in our community. We are seeing therefore an impact on the budget when it comes to out-of-home care. 

Likewise, when it comes to youth justice and the Ashley Youth Detention Centre, I know a number of my colleagues have commented that this centre should have been closed years ago, yet we continue to increase funding for it. It is a direct consequence of this government's failure to properly look after young people in this state.  

We keep having to put more and more money into it.

I turn to the Department of Health. Here under 'Health Demand and Sales Requirements', an amount of $340 million is provided to address health service demand growth together with increases in the cost of health service delivery, particularly in relation to hospital admitted and non-admitted services. The increase in expenditure primarily relates to employer related costs - $232.2 million - and supplies and consumables, at a cost of $89 million. The increase in demand relates to additional emergency department presentations, additional overnight hospital admissions and additional attendance at outpatient specialist clinics.

There are no surprises here. We have one of the sickest populations in the country. It is no surprise that a demand in our health services increases time and time again. This government is fooling themselves with every budget they deliver when they try and cut back on health, or try to not reflect the true cost of what a sick community looks like.

This is absolutely ridiculous. It is not being honest and truthful with the Tasmanian people. It is them trying to do tricky things with budget papers without reflecting the actual and increasing demand on health services.

The same situation applies with mental health and wellbeing. Again, an amount of $4.97 million is provided to address continuing demand pressures on the delivery of mental health services in Tasmania. This is not a new problem. This has been going on for a very long time. The increase in demand is highly predictable, yet the government under-budgets and comes to us wanting additional appropriation to try to fund areas of demand that are a direct result of their policy failures.

Again, a similar circumstance with the Department of Justice and Minister for Corrections and Rehabilitation, where we see an increased required amount for the Tasmanian Prison Service because of cost pressures. An amount of $25 million has been provided for cost pressures impacting the Tasmanian Prison Service. The TPS continues to experience difficulty attracting and maintaining sufficient levels of correctional staff, which has led to additional overtime requirements. Other cost pressures include the growth in the prison population, increases in workers compensation premiums and general prison expenditure such as food and clothing. This is entirely the government's own creation.

If they treat their workers like crap, this is what happens. If they continue to have their 'tough on crime' rhetoric without addressing the causes of crime, we get a greater prison population. It costs more. It is not rocket science.

Again, there are serious government failures here. It is not good enough. We should be able to predict these, and we should be addressing these issues at the cause, not just dipping into Tasmania's pockets more and more. We simply cannot afford it.

Moving to the Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management - support for injured workers. An amount of $14.5 million has been provided to meet the increased cost of workers compensation premiums to be paid to the Tasmanian Risk Management Fund. The increase in the premium is driven by an increase in the number of workers compensation cases and the increased complexity of individual cases. Again, not rocket science. Failure to look after our police and emergency and fire management services means they are getting injured at work. We pay more.

It is very frustrating. We need to nip these things in the bud. We need some proper, sound financial management. We need to understand the reality of the pressures facing our workforce, and putting things in like vacancy control measures does not help. This is just a snapshot of the few things that are particularly frustrating about this. I sincerely hope that the government listens hard to the parliament and to the community, and when it delivers its budget on 29 May, starts to look at the root causes of some of these things. I hope it starts to be real about the cost of delivering health services, and what the cost is of our prison population, their 'tough on crime' stance, because that is what is needed on these issues - truthfulness.

I cannot let it go without saying that included in this supplementary appropriations bill is a fairly healthy dose of corporate welfare-ism. Again, in the current financial situation that we are facing, where Tasmanians are vulnerable and in dire need of support, we see corporates and big business getting a significant benefit, yet we see people on the housing waitlist, on the health waitlist, and children failing to meet the most basic reading and writing levels.

I was at Northgate on Friday speaking to my constituents there. They were disgusted - all of them - with the position of the budget. They were all deeply concerned about the position of the budget. I had people coming up to me time and time again. I think it was three people who told me they have been on the housing waiting list for over seven years. That is three people who approached me at Northgate in a space of four hours to tell me they have been waiting for over seven years. That is not good enough. Time and time again, we see big business getting the benefit from this government and Tasmanians who need to rely on them mostly being ignored.

Time expired.
[3.57 p.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to talk on the appropriation bill. Last year, I stood up and called the budget dishonest because, in part, it included figures that were simply unrealistic. I said the projection to return to surplus based on figures in the forward Estimates was pure fantasy that involved jiggery-pokery because it forecast a fall in operating expenses of 2.4 per cent over three years - something which has not happened over the past 20 years. This dishonesty has been fully exposed by this bill today. It shows that the Department of Health budget, which is the biggest cost item in the budget, was under-budgeted by 15 per cent. Health expenditure, far from going down by 2.4 per cent, has gone up by 15 per cent. This is an aberration. This happens regularly with the Health budget. This is the government that claims it has a path to surplus. 

We can only hope that the new Treasurer will end this dishonesty, or this wilful blindness, and we will get a far more realistic set of numbers in this year's budget and forward Estimates because this recurring discrepancy undermines people's trust in government.

The other aspect of this bill I want to comment on is the additional expenditure on what is essential, the criminal justice system, and whether this additional expenditure is actually improving outcomes. The outcomes we are seeing from our criminal and youth justice systems were very clearly set out in the 2025 Productivity Commission Report on Government Services, which was released in January this year. The outcomes reported in that report, alongside the additional expenditure being sought through this bill, paint a picture of a criminal justice system in this state that is completely buckling after 10 years of policy failure.

We have the second highest number of police per capita of any jurisdiction and the second highest spend per capita, which is no surprise as this government has preferred a tough-on-crime approach: more police, and tougher sentences for those who break the law. How is this playing out? The police are requiring an additional $14.5 million to cover the extent of their workers compensation claims. This is a clear sign that something is very wrong in the management of the police force, how they are being supported and what they are being asked to do.

We know the courts are buckling. In our Supreme Court, a defendant must appear, on average, 16.7 times before their case is resolved. In the Magistrates Court, which deals with the vast majority of offences, we have the second highest number of people being acquitted in the nation, which is generally taken to be a reflection of people being charged when they should not have been. We have the equal second highest number of magistrates per capita, yet we have the second lowest clearance rate of any jurisdiction, and lowest clearance rate when it comes to youth matters.

Then we get to the prisons and the youth detention centres. We knew things were bad in Ashley Youth Detention Centre thanks to the commission of inquiry. Despite the recommendation that the detention centre be closed as soon as possible, it is still operating. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, no one wants to work there, resulting in costs almost 25 per cent over budget to pay for the overtime. How is this impacting on the use and the staff there?

The prison system, similarly, has gone almost 20 per cent over budget because they, too, cannot find anyone to work there. What impact is this having on the prisoners and the staff who have to work overtime? Perhaps it should come as no surprise when last year there has been a 20 per cent increase since 2021-22. According to the Productivity Commission report, the cost of housing a person in prison in Tasmania has gone up 92 per cent in a decade. That is almost the same increase as the Health budget. The cost increase is the highest in the nation and nearly double the national average cost growth. It is also worth noting that we have the second lowest rate of prisoner employment in the nation and the equal-second highest rate of assaults in the prisons. With this sort of ongoing issue in our prisons system, it is little wonder that last year 51 per cent of those released from prison were back in there within two years. This is the second-highest recidivism rate in the nation. These are outcomes this government should be ashamed of. 

I would also like to know more about the $10 million equity investment in the Dolphin tungsten mine and whether the state is likely to see a return of that money.

[4.02 p.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise and make a contribution on the supplementary appropriation bill. This week and last week of parliament, after an extended summer recess, has really brought to light the reality of the circumstances this government has brought to Tasmania. I commented last week that the government or the Premier had hoped the delayed start to parliament would ensure a delayed scrutiny, delayed responsibility for the government, and they might be able to hide from the realities we find ourselves in. Year on year, time and again, this government failed to be honest about the circumstances Tasmanians are in because of its mismanagement. When this government failed to heed the warnings of many different commentators and, in fact, their own treasury, it was always going to be that we would find ourselves in the most excruciating financial circumstances that Tasmania has ever experienced.

The Fiscal Sustainability Report was released only weeks after I arrived in this place. A number of members have referred to that because we all read it. We all wanted to see what the Treasury was recommending to the government, and if the government would respond. However, successive treasurers and the Premier failed to heed those warnings. It set out very clearly that if this government continued on the path it was on, there were four options of correction available to them; and that if they continued to ignore the realities, not only would the situation get worse, but it would be harder to correct.

This government launched into their Strong Plan, they have launched into their fourth 100-day plan, down in the weeds, tripping over each other, not being able to lift themselves up to see what they could do and how they could act responsibly in Tasmania's best interests. They have now seemingly scrapped their Strong Plan and are talking about this pathway to surplus. The Treasurer is in the room now. I have asked the Treasurer before and other people have asked him to map out this magical, mystical pathway to surplus. If you cannot state year on year or even half-year on half-year what your pathway looks like, it does not exist. If you cannot articulate it in financial terms, it is not real. If it was real, if this government had a pathway to surplus and a strong plan, they would not have needed, in recent days, to have announced this distracting and desperate policy to sell off Tasmania's future through privatisation. If they had a plan, they would not be so desperate to sell Tasmania's valuable assets and put us in an even worse situation in the future.

The other thing I understand, but I do not think the Premier understands, the one thing it is difficult for people to understand if they are financially thoughtful, is a premier who says he is going to sell off Tasmania's future, privatise the important assets of Tasmania and stick the proceeds in a future fund. Last week, not only did he call it a future fund but he called it a sovereign wealth fund, then, in the next breath, he says 'to pay off debt'. The only reason you would contemplate selling something of value to put in a future fund is to invest it. They say it themselves: invest it in future assets, future financial returning assets. This government is in such a poor position financially that only months after bringing down the budget, it has a supplementary appropriation for significant amounts of money. To sell off valuable assets of Tasmania to put not in a future fund, let us be honest again, but in order to pay down the debt you have put us in, is irresponsible and lacking foresight.

Mr Rockliff has been the Premier for three financial years now. The last three financial years, Tasmania has experienced the worst financial outcomes. We are in a worse position in debt and a worse position in our deficit than we have ever been before the same three years this premier has led Tasmania. In those three years the Premier has been a minority leader in this parliament, Tasmania has lost 6000 full-time jobs. There is no way in this place we can grow economically and strengthen Tasmania's position when jobs are being lost, people are fleeing Tasmania, the economic circumstances are flatlining and this government seeks to sell off those things that are valuable and contribute to the ongoing opportunities in the economy in Tasmania.

To speak specifically to the supplementary appropriation and to some of the concerns that have been presented, a number of members have just spoken about it, the insult to Tasmania where members on this side and the crossbench say to the government at the time of bringing down a budget, 'We do not believe you'. We do not believe that the things that you have put either in the current year or across the forward Estimates are actually possible for you to deliver. We know that you will need to come back and amend this over time but the government seeks in the time where they deliver their budget to misrepresent the reality of the demands on services, the costs of delivering those services, they undercook it in the budget in order to paint a positive picture in the moment and then have to come back like they do now, and like they are doing more and more often, to have these supplementary appropriations.

It is really interesting. We have Casey in the Chamber now, new to parliament. It would appear when you are new to a parliament that these things are normal. Supplementary appropriations should not be normal. They should not be as normalised as they are in this parliament, like when I came into the parliament, proroguing was normal.

The number of times that this government is using instruments of the parliament to cover up their mismanagement is something that Tasmanians should not be or should not need to be becoming desensitised to. They should not be something that just happens as a regular course of parliamentary activity. The Premier is asking this parliament for nearly half a billion dollars to cover their cost blowouts just in the last four months since the budgets were passed. If you break that down into fundamentals, that is $4 million a day of blowouts in just the four months since the budget bills were passed.

This level of incompetence and inability to manage money has been demonstrated over the 11 years of this government. When they came into government they were in a strong financial position; the books in Tasmania were in a strong financial position; there was money in the bank and now we are looking at the point where over the forward Estimates we will be looking to $10 billion of debt. It is extraordinary. Over these last three years, the worst three financial outcomes on record.

Tasmanians expect more. They expect the government to be upfront. They expect the government to be honest. One of the other things that I think is really quite disrespectful is the reference to COVID to try and get away and escape from the realities of their mismanagement and the depths of the debt that occurs. Yes, COVID happened, and I know our previous shadow health minister and our shadow health minister now continue to say, as others do, that the investments that were made in COVID were necessary and essential, but in terms of how much they materially make up of the debts that we are actually experiencing now, this government dishonestly represents that. The financial position of Tasmania was already deteriorating before we experienced COVID and has more rapidly deteriorated since.

There are a number of people who are commenting on Tasmania's position. We have signals of concern coming from a whole number of experts in this space. Saul Eslake has been named a number of times and has been engaged by the government to look at and make recommendations about certain things to do with the parliament and the government's privatisation agenda but we have Moody's, S&P, CommSec, Deloitte and Access Economics, all talking about the negative circumstances that Tasmania finds itself in now. With the amount that we have to pay annually just to cover the interest of the debt is phenomenal and that amount will continue to grow. Sometimes, something is bad, and then when you read it or you hear it, you get the real understanding of how bad it is. Specifically, when the Revised Estimates Report came out, not that long after the original budget, the revenues were revised up by $49.7 million, so let us say $50 million, and by $723 over the Budget and forward Estimates - expenses. That was budget: about $50 million. The expenses have been revised up by $553 million over a billion dollars over the forward Estimates. For every dollar that the government has increased in revenues, they are going to spend 10 times that. The lack of constraint, the lack of financial responsibility that this government, this Premier, think that Tasmanians will allow them to get away with is extraordinary.

There are some very specific overruns and blowouts in the Budget that have been identified by others already, where we know that when it was presented in the Budget and the forward Estimates, people questioned at that time. They questioned in Estimates scrutiny that you could not possibly see that down grading of expenses and expect it to be real. We said that at that time. We knew people would have to come back with this supplementary appropriation.

Tasmanian Labor expect this government not to continue; we expect that. We do not actually have any confidence or trust that they will continue. We ask this government, we demand of this government on behalf of Tasmanians that you begin to be honest about the circumstances that you have created for Tasmanians, that you stop throwing up distractions and you start to actually get to work on correcting the circumstances that we find ourselves in.

There is no doubt that the announcement about red tape reduction, whether it be the announcement about privatisation, whatever the announcements that this government is making, they are actually trying to flurry people away from the simple task that this government needs to focus on, which is their expenditure. They need to figure out how they can properly run our GBEs in our state owned companies. I know that we have been saying, and our leader this morning said, if you do not know how to run the GBEs well, stand out of the way so a good performing government can actually operate and deliver with those GBEs, because the reality is just because you cannot do it, it does not mean a good government cannot. We know that just because you cannot manage the budget, that does not mean a good performing government cannot.

Tasmanian Labor do not want to hear about the future fund. It is a furphy. It is just a way of you seeking to try and sell off valuable assets to pay down debt. We do not believe in your pathway to surplus. Unless you can actually paint a picture and in financial terms, year on year, outline how you are going to achieve a pathway to surplus. It does not exist. It is just mythical.

We know that your strong plan is destroyed like you have destroyed our budget. At the moment, in desperation, the only possible thing that you can think to do is to sell Tasmania's future by privatising our significant and valuable assets. It was interesting that last week the Premier almost made an admission about how he had wrecked the budget. He almost made an admission about how out of control debt is, but unbelievably decided that the only thing he could possibly do was to sell off our assets.

This is a Premier who has been the Premier for three years over Tasmania's three worst financial outcomes. This is a Premier who has led across the loss of 6000 full time jobs in the Tasmanian economy. If the Premier's privatisation agenda - it will not be - but if it was successful, we know that over the past 10 years government businesses have actually returned to the Tasmanian budget and therefore activated the economy over $4 billion worth of dividends and made payments to help fund our schools, fund our hospitals and our emergency services.

We know over those past 10 years, MAIB have provided nearly $1 billion in dividends and other returns that have helped fund our schools, our hospitals and emergency services. Over those same 10 years, TasNetworks have provided nearly half a billion dollars in dividends and hundreds of millions of dollars more in other returns and provided critical equity to support Hydro, TasRail and Sustainable Timber Tasmania (STT).

This government has to start being real, being honest and actually getting to the task of correcting the massive mess that they have made with the Tasmanian Budget. This Supplementary Appropriation came as no surprise.

Mr WILLIE - Point of order, Deputy Speaker, can I just clarify, what is the quorum? I am just bringing attention to the state of the House. The government is here asking for nearly $470 million and they do not even have enough members in the House.

Mrs Petrusma - One member is in the Chair. It would have been three.

Quorum formed.

[4.17 p.m.]
Ms FINLAY - Deputy Speaker, it is an interesting point. Eight or nine members of the Chamber have stood to speak on the supplementary appropriation bill this afternoon because it is critically important to the state of Tasmania. It is critically important to scrutinise and prosecute the inability of this government to manage their finances, so much so that they are seeking this place to support a significant supplementary appropriation because they undercooked and underestimated the demands required of the Tasmanian budget. Yet, on the other side, the minority Liberal government of Tasmania, led by a premier who has overseen the three worst financial years in Tasmania's history, the three years he has been the Premier, has only had the Treasurer rise to speak on this this afternoon - one government member about the supplementary appropriation. That is unbelievable. This government does not take its financial mismanagement seriously enough to stand and defend it. They do not take it seriously enough to rise and say why it is critical. They do not - 

Mr WILLIE - Point of order, Deputy Speaker, I am going to draw your attention to the state of the House again. This is ridiculous. They are asking for a significant amount of money and they cannot even have enough members in here giving the courtesy of the Chamber.

Quorum formed.

Mr Willie - You are asking for a lot of money. The least you can do is be here.

Ms FINLAY - That was the shadow treasurer, Josh Willie, commenting across the Chamber that the government is asking for a lot of money in this supplementary appropriation; the least this government could do is take it seriously and be in the Chamber while debate occurs. Only the Treasurer has risen to stand to the supplementary appropriation, despite multiple members of the crossbench and our side of the House standing to outline how significant and serious it is that a government only months into its budget is calling for almost half-a-billion dollars.

The government does not have a strong plan. That is ripped to shreds. They think they want to invest in a future fund, but we know that they just want to try to sell off Tasmania's future to pay down the debt they have created with their big mess. They do not have a pathway to surplus, they cannot manage money, and they have demonstrated over the previous three years that they have continued to drive Tasmania into the worst financial position on record. The government needs to put up more speakers to defend its position and outline why Tasmanians should trust it with the finances of this state. Tasmanian Labor has high expectations of this government to do the right thing and to start being honest. 

If you cannot be honest with Tasmanians about the financial circumstances of this state and your inability to manage the budget, then Tasmanians will continue to ask questions and require scrutiny of your future expectations of the budget. When we come to the budget in May, you cannot expect this place to take seriously your confident assumptions, or that your future expenses in the forward Estimates are real and reflect the reality of the demands on the services in Tasmania.

If you think Tasmanians will accept the sell-off of their future to try and cover up your budget reality, you are poorly misled. Tasmanians will not accept it. They will not accept you selling off their valuable assets and the future of Tasmania to try and protect your deteriorating political standing.

[4.22 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise this afternoon to speak on the Appropriation (Supplementary Appropriation for 2024-25) Bill 2025. I will begin by echoing what the member for Clark, Mr Bayley, said earlier about the Greens' support for this bill. It is important that our public services are funded and that the important work of service provision is able to continue for Tasmanians. 

I am new in this place and have experienced only one budget. This is my first supplementary appropriation bill. It is startling to me that we had a budget not that many months ago and here we are being asked to approve another almost half-a-billion dollars to fund things for Tasmanians. It would seem to me to be an indication that the government presented a faulty and flaky budget that was insufficient right from the start; one that did not even come close to allowing the necessary spending within our state. 

It is clear the government wanted a better looking budget last year, and maybe they pretended things matched up a little bit more than they actually did. Instead of being truthful and realistic, they wound back the figures and underfunded services in the 2024-25 budget. There was just not enough in the budget. Here we are needing a significant injection of funding to keep things going. The government, in its efforts to give an appearance of responsibility, has failed to do its job to provide for Tasmanians. It is good to be honest now and let us see what is really needed to run services in our state. However, it would be even better to be honest upfront and provide a more accurate financial plan for the state. Let us hope this year's budget gives us a more accurate plan for Tasmania.

I will turn briefly to some of the aspects of this supplementary appropriation bill and the reasons the government have given us for needing more funding. I will begin by talking about out-of-home care. The government says an amount of $14.1 million is provided for in this bill to support an increase in the number of children accessing special care packages. We obviously need to ensure that children in care have the support and a safe place to live, but this $14.1 million is an indication of the need for better funding of services to support families and to support carers. Also, to provide therapeutic supports. Children do not suddenly need to be placed on special care packages that cost significant amounts more. They end up needing a special care package because placements have broken down or because difficult behaviours have become overwhelming and too difficult for the carers they are living with. Children need special care packages because we are not meeting their needs earlier in the process. We could be putting $14.1 million into prevention of children needing to go into special care packages. 

We talk about wanting to support families more. I can see that there is $2.95 million being provided for resourcing the advice and referral line. That is good, but we also need to be increasing funding for the services providing support to families and to children. We need to be making sure that families have what they need to be able to provide safety and care for their children, so that we do not need to remove their children.

We need to be keeping children out of out-of-home care as much as we possibly can, and the way to do that is to fund family supports, so that we do not end up with a $14.1 million unexpected bill to cover the costs of children who require extra care. Placements for children in care break down when there is a lack of support, increasing pressure and strain on carers. They break down when children's needs are not being met. If we are going to take seriously caring for our children, we need to turn around the way we are looking at things. Instead of funding services upstream where they are really expensive, we need to be funding families on the ground where they are, meeting their needs so their children can stay with them and so that they have what they need to live and to thrive.

When it comes to youth justice and the Ashley Youth Detention Centre, if the Ashley Youth Detention Centre had been closed as the government committed to doing last year, this bill would not exist. We would be investing in other things, and that is what we need to be doing. Instead of having the number of children and young people in Ashley Youth Detention Centre increasing, which we know it is - the average number of children in Ashley Youth Dissension Centre is increasing and has increased significantly - we need to be investing in prevention.
I note that the Youth Justice Strategic Plan - the blueprint - provides a really great outline of what we can do to help reduce the number of children and young people who are engaging with the youth justice system. It includes things like ensuring that children and young people and their families have the housing that they need. It includes what I was talking about earlier about funding families to have what they need to support their children and provide safety. It includes looking at a child holistically, meeting their needs broadly.

We can prevent the number of children and young people entering into our youth justice system if we just look at it differently. We need to turn things around and invest on the ground, investing where young people are so that they do not need or want to be involved in criminal behaviour - because their needs are being met. We also need to be investing more in diversion.

There is $4.14 million for Ashley Youth Detention Centre. It meets the need that is there now, but if we did things differently, that need would not be there at all. It is more financially responsible to fund services that help prevent children entering into Ashley Youth Detention Centre.

Turning to the Health budget, the government say that the amount of $340 million is being provided to address health services demand growth, and similarly mental health services funding is being increased by almost $5 million due to increasing demand and pressure. There is plenty of information available about the growth in need for health services. These demands can be foreseen. They can be planned for. The government needs to plan for them in advance instead of coming in a few months into a budget and asking for more money. We need to be stating clearly, upfront and accurately what is needed for our Health services so that those services then have certainty and can budget for the year, ensuring that they are providing the services they need. 

When it comes to staffing within the Health service, we know that there are vacancies and difficulties in the Health service. Let us support our health staff in Tasmania. Let us work on creating cultures and environments that people want to work in. Let us work on reducing the stress and pressure in the system. If we are not looking after our staff, we are going to lose them, and then we end up in a situation where we have to fill the gaps with locums and agency staff, which end up costing more money. It goes back to what I was talking about before with children in Youth Services and with youth justice.

We need to be looking at funding things at a more primary level rather than getting to this acute stage where we have to pour millions of extra dollars into funding services. This could have been prevented, and we could have avoided needing to do that.

I would also like to speak to the government's comments on the Tasmanian Prison Service and the cost pressures there. They refer in their supporting information to other cost pressures, including the growth in the prison population. What a surprise. When we deliberately lock more people up, despite all the available evidence clearly showing it does not make communities safer to lock more people up - it does not make a difference; it might feel better or look good to be locking more people up, but it does not actually achieve what the government say they are wanting to achieve with this - it is no surprise that we now have a cost blowout within the prison services due to increased pressure and growth in the prison population.

Once again, we get back to prevention. There are many things that this government could be doing that would prevent the need for this further injection of funding, like if they were funding services at a primary level, more appropriately in line with evidence and in ways that met the needs of Tasmanians earlier, before it gets to crisis point and costs us so much more money.

I join with the other Greens who have spoken today in calling on the government to be truthful in their budgeting and to also look to the evidence in their budgeting and their planning of services. They should be investing in services that make a difference early so that people do not end up in desperate situations needing more support down the track. It is good for the economy, but ultimately it is good for the people of Tasmania that they are able to live better, healthier and happier lives. We call for the government to get their priorities right in the way they do their budgeting.

[4.33 p.m.]
Ms BROWN (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I rise today to speak on the Appropriation (Supplementary Appropriation for 2024-25) Bill 2025. Before I start, I have to say it is quite weak of this government to only put up one speaker for a bill like this where they are coming to ask for more money for a budget - money they could have foreseen.

This bill is another stark example of Jeremy Rockliff and this minority Liberal government not being able to manage money or manage this state. We already have a cooked budget, and today we see the Treasurer come into this place with his hand held out asking for more money, asking the parliament for nearly half-a-billion dollars to cover cost blowouts. That is $4 million of blowouts per day. 

What is the bill for? For the Department of Education, Children and Young People, it is $14.1 million for out-of-home care; $4.1 million for Youth Justice and the Ashley Detention Centre, which should already be closed; $2.9 million for the advice and referrals line; for the Department of Justice, $25 million to address the Tasmanian Prison Service's cost pressures; and for the Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management, the amount of $14.5 million to support injured workers.

I want to put on record my sincere thanks and appreciation to our police officers. They put their lives at risk for Tasmanians every single day and they deserve a government that is going to back them, not continue to allow them to be hurt. They deserve a roster that is going to work for them, and it is astounding that they cannot foresee that there is going to be more payouts and more workers on compensation if they are not going to support them.

What are we getting in return for these blowouts, where we are getting a fire sale from this government, where all of our state assets are on the chopping block. After the severe mismanagement of the TT-Line, the Premier will not even rule out selling the Spirits and Tasmanians are expected to pay the price on this. This is shameful. Even MAIB is on the chopping block. This GBE provides the government with significant dividends. 

I have in my hands the transcript from the GBE scrutiny of 2024. I want to read the opening comments of the minister for Transport:

By way of an opening statement, three very quick points. MAIB has the lowest premiums of any insurer in this area in Australia. Big tick. It has a very comprehensive and, in comparative terms, generous scheme to victims of road trauma. Another big tick. From its investments, it provides a good dividend to its government, which is another big tick. I compliment the MAIB board, management and staff for their work that they do.

Does this sound like a GBE that is worth selling? No, because I now look to a Dorothy Dixer that came from Mr Behrakis:

Minister, can you please inform the committee about the MAIB's actual payments and the four dividend projections over the coming years?

Mr Abetz:

This year - I think at the end of this month - MAIB will be delivering a dividend of $37.6 million. Over the past, what, 10 years, the dividends range from $30 million to $56 million, so it's always been a very healthy and welcome dividend to the government over the past decade.

It is very interesting that they will not rule that out, considering that this minister has always spoken very highly of MAIB. Can you imagine not ruling that out for privatisation when the minister talks it up? 

Everybody knows how passionate I am about Metro Tasmania and its workers, but under this government it has been run into the ground. Metro Tasmania is the backbone of our public transport network. For years we have seen this government completely neglect Metro Tasmania, running it into the ground so they can justify selling it off. Only at the last Estimates committee, we saw the minister for Transport refer questions to the GBE scrutiny hearing because he could not answer the questions. These questions arose from the budget that this government handed down. He flogged off answering the questions over 17 times. This is not a minister or a government that is working diligently, side by side, with this GBE to ensure that they are thriving, but to ensure that they do not.

The reality is that privatisation is a failed experiment and this government is too blind to see it. They are selling the future of Tasmania for a sugar hit to try and save a budget that they themselves have wrecked. They are responsible for the past 11 years. They are responsible for this $10 billion deficit that we see. They have only themselves to blame here.

When the Liberal Party took over government in 2014, they had zero net debt and now we see $10 billion debt. Under Jeremy Rockliff, this government has delivered three budgets with the largest physical deficit on record. These are the facts. The fact is that this Premier, this Treasurer, and this government cannot handle money and now Tasmania has to pay the price.

[4.41 p.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, it really is quite puzzling. I echo the comments from the member for Bass, Ms Rosol. Similarly, this has been my first budget and it is absolutely astonishing that that was a late budget. It was not that long ago, really. We have only just had the Revised Budget Papers released for February 2025, and yet, here we are debating this bill. A lot of these expenses are actually not entirely unpredictable. The writing was on the wall for quite a few of them, such as the Parks operational support, the $8 million here for an increase in costs to the management of Tasmania's parks and reserves as a direct result of increased visitation, new infrastructure such as the Cradle Mountain Visitor Centre and the new facilities including the fly-out waste from the remote toilets. That is all pretty obvious. 

We know the visitor statistics. We know that investment is also going to continually and exponentially increase that visitation, so maintenance and expenditure costs are going to go up. This $8 million top up was described to rectify an ongoing deficiency where the Parks budget is consistently not met and that has been happening over recent years. There is a pattern here. We are told there will be matters put forward to address this more permanently in the next budget. We will believe that when we see it in a few weeks' time.

I want to touch on the firefighting part for Parks, because Parks hold up an enormous responsibility in that section. They are one of the three agencies responsible in contributing. I also want to give an enormous thanks for the ongoing work that they have been doing at the moment with the present fires. A lot of that is off their back and then they can go to the Commonwealth reserves, particularly for firefighting in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (TWWHA), but a lot of the actions actually have to meet a specific criteria for them to then be reimbursed adequately from it. Alternatively, their funding is coming from the Treasurer's reserve.

The statewide expenditure on the suppression of major bushfires - and this is mainly within the TWWHA again - has been of a similar magnitude to the total reported annual expenditure on all parks land managed activities. For example, approximately $60 million was spent on fire suppression in 2015-16: the same as that reported annual expenditure for Parks Land Management. These sums are not being met out of all the departmental budgets. They are paid for either by those appropriation funds such as what we are doing now or through the Australian government.

That risk for the initial outlie does lay on Parks. The question has to be asked: where is that climate emergency fund holistically to look at these emergency situations, be it fire or flooding; Parks or another agency? Where is the climate adaptation fund - a tourism climate adaptation fund? There are plenty of non-essential projects that could have their budget reinvested so that such prevention and adaptation funds could instead be put forward.

Back to Parks' core business, because this is an ongoing deficiency - it is not a new issue. There are losses being made on the Three Capes Track; the cost of maintenance is exceeding the fees paid by visitors to walk on the track. This has been the case for the past three financial years. Let us also not forget the $600,000 that was put towards marketing for Tasmanian Walking Company, a private company. This walk, the Three Capes walk, was supposed to pay for itself. The question has to be asked that given that the next iconic walk, the proposed $40 million Tyndall Range idea, has also been promoted as a walk that will pay for itself based on the same economics as the Three Capes walk. Is this actually realistic?

Absolutely nobody is being fooled into thinking that somehow the Tyndall Range proposed walk is magically immune to inflation. It has been costed at $40 million since 2021 - the project design has been changed since then. There are now additional pods. There have been track realignments. This all alters that cost. Whether it makes it cheaper or not, it has to be put forward. We have to see that revised business case. It is completely negligent that we have not. It is just another example of this government's poor fiscal management.

How is it that one of Tasmania's 60 Great Short Walks, the Evercreech Forest Reserve, the 'White Knights' walk, has been closed since September 2024? These are the prime, easily accessible walks that we are trying to promote, yet it has been closed. Is it because of a lack of funding for basic track maintenance?

The Tasmanian National Parks Association (TNPA), recently undertook an analysis of the investment into Tasmania that the Tasmanian government quite specifically, has made into the management of public reserve land, and that is over the 21 financial years since the Nature Conservation Act 2002 and the National Parks and Reserves Management Act 2002 commenced. From 2002 to the 2023 financial year, expenditure on the departmental output of parks management was gradually increasing. Despite some general fluctuations from year to year, on average it was increasing. There was a reduction in expenditure after 2018 to 2019, then there was a peak for COVID, for that financial year around 2020. Since then, funding has dropped and has not returned to the numbers in the intervening period. Parks is having less invested from this Liberal government with more infrastructure to take care of and more visitors. This $8 million we are talking about is predictable.

Looking into the future, the Tasmanian government's 2024-2025 budget announced in September forecasts less expenditure on the departmental output of parks management in each of the three financial years than it plans to spend on that output this financial year, 2024-25. In other words, this government has been choosing to underfund Parks, and certainly investment in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, which is not exclusively a Tasmanian government responsibility. There is input from the federal government as well. However, this past year it has been the lowest it has been in a decade. It is simply not good enough when that is our greatest safeguard in the climate and biodiversity crisis.

Capital expenditure in Parks has been skewed towards a small number of projects, most notably the Three Capes Track, which I have already touched on, and the Cradle Mountain visitor experience. Costs for the Cradle Mountain cableway have now skyrocketed to $225 million from the $60 million starting point just a few years ago. That is based on the government's 80 per cent of the total project asked from the federal government of $180 million. Maybe it is time the government stopped focusing on vanity projects and remembered the basic roles Parks has to undertake, like flying in and out the remote toilets, servicing the facilities and looking after vital visitor centres such as those at Cradle Mountain and Freycinet.

We could give Parks the $40 million intended for the Tyndall Range walk that is non-essential. Parks could also have the $40 million of Tasmania's latest contribution to the cableway, if we are to put in that 20 per cent of the $225 million. There has to be a long-term plan because the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania (NRE Tas) is an essential service in the climate emergency, or maybe the long-term idea on the privatisation agenda is to sell Wineglass Bay. 

I also hope the Treasurer can explain how the $32 million for NRE Tas and Parks operational support in the revised Estimates for 2024-25, the February document on page 5, does or does not sit with the $8 million in this bill.

I echo other members' sincere thanks for the work our police force does. The work they do is tough and complex. The workers compensation premium is up as a result of the additional demands, and police workers on compensation do not have step-down provisions. For example, they are not on 100 per cent of their salary for a period of the time and then it drops down to 80 per cent for another period, and so on. They are on 100 per cent until resolved. The increase we are currently seeing is driven by an increase in complexity of cases and various legislative changes as well. Also, the costs associated with psychological workers compensation is up five to six times. That is more expensive than physical injury so, of course, these costs are up. 

Where is the future contingency funding for police and, indeed, all emergency service workers in need of assistance for trauma, mental health support, injuries, and so on after they leave the workforce? We also have to question what the duty of care is for State Service employees into their retirement, after they have finished serving our communities, keeping them safe, happy and healthy. 

There is also more in this bill in regard to extra funding on various mental health support services. What has been done to properly address mental health issues in our state? We are increasing stress on our community by not taking adequate action on the housing crisis, on the cost-of-living crisis, or on the climate crisis. This is all increasing stress. 

I am hoping the Treasurer can also articulate the additional $5 million for the Aviation Attraction Fund, which is not in any way essential funding. This is Liberal policy, as I recall, that definitely could have been initially included in the budget.

Onto tourism and hospitality: what is this government's long-term plan for tourism in the state? For the past decade we have stayed on a very similar path and plan, with a lot of gentrified products that we are trying to continually push, while other nature-based destinations around the world, at least post-COVID, have been investing into niche market segments and they are growing regenerative tourism. For example, in New Zealand, they have actively been investing and planning into de-growing some tourism-heavy nature destinations where mechanised overdevelopments have become counterproductive to those nature-based values that people were going there to see and experience. That is certainly what they have been doing at Milford Sound, and that is what Tasmania should be doing. 

If we are going to maintain a competitive position in this global market, we have to be investing properly. We have to be investing in the niche markets such as dark sky tourism that have low impact but are high-yielding. We should have a dark sky sanctuary in the south-west, and we also need to be investing in more regenerative tourism opportunities.

It also means looking at proper long-term funding and considerations for industry and climate adaptation. A few weeks ago, UTAS academics highlighted the need for a tourism adaptation fund to help businesses in hardship in abnormal events, such as the mass penguin evacuation in Bicheno over summer, which coincided with a localised ocean temperature warming by 4 degrees Celsius.

The $11 million that went into severe weather events for community food grants and the like made an extraordinary difference to the people affected by that flooding, and that is absolutely fantastic. It is the core role of the government to be looking after the people so, of course, that should be in there. However, long-term, to help fix this absolute budget mess, where are we investing in proper climate mitigation strategies? Where is the ecosystem restoration fund? Again, where is that adaptation fund for tourism businesses?

Basically, what we have before us are skewed priorities. These are the wrong long-term priorities and they are creating a huge debt that will be serviced by future generations of Tasmanians. These are Tasmanians who are not only going to inherit this debt that has been chosen by this Liberal government, but they will also inherit the climate crisis, which is inevitably going to increase debt unless we can properly fix our investment in some mitigation. 

[4.54 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Treasurer) - Honourable Speaker, thank you to colleagues who have made a contribution in this Chamber. It is appreciated. It is an important bill. It is one that has been consistently introduced by different colours and persuasions of government over many years. Certainly, my advice is, since we have been in government, there has been a supplementary appropriation bill, and likewise when the Labor-Greens government was in power certainly, in the last two years, in terms of the research that I have. I thank all members for their contributions and I look forward to addressing those remarks and responding to those queries as best I can. 

I also thank my department and my team for the offer made to all members of parliament for a briefing on the bill, which I think was taken up by most members in the parliament.

I am pleased to have been able to be open and transparent with this supplementary appropriations bill, to be able to answer questions put to the department in advance of this debate today. Thank you very much to my department, particularly to Eleanor Patterson, Rebecca Blackwell and Craig Jeffery, who have done a lot of this work in preparation, together with members of their team, and my secretary, Gary Swain.

We have tried to address this bill in a spirit of collaboration and good will, and I think that has been demonstrated reasonably well during the debate and in advance of the debate today. However, there have been some very significant criticisms of the government, which I intend to respond to in full to the best of my ability on behalf of our government. There has been a lot of - particularly from state Labor - whingeing, a lot of scaring and scaremongering rather than putting forward solutions. That is disappointing. I will have more to say about that.

I thought I would share with colleagues in this place the latest information from the NAB business survey that was released earlier today, which put Tasmania at number one: number one in Australia for business confidence. This is news hot off the press. This is so encouraging. We are also in the top two in terms of business conditions across Australia, according to the NAB survey. We are in fact a massive 11 index points ahead of the national average. In terms of topping the chart for business confidence, it is a strong sign that we are on the right track. The Premier and I, and those across our government, have said that we are standing shoulder to shoulder with the business community. We are backing business, backing industry and creating jobs. Today is just another indicator of that happening in Tasmania.

The Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI) applauded the Premier's agenda last week as the most ambitious in decades. They called upon the opposition Labor Party to work with the government to progress our agenda that is pro-business, pro-economy, and pro-creating jobs. That remains the call that I put to state Labor today. 

We are totally committed to slashing red tape and removing burdensome and outdated legislation and regulations so that business can get on with doing what they do well. That is the environment we want to create in Tasmania. Clearly, the message is getting out there. We want to be leading the nation as a start-up capital of Australia via our Small Business Start-Up Permit. There is also the single form tendering that I announced late last week, backed in by the National Electrical Contractors Association of Australia, Ben Shaw and others, for which I am very grateful. That business confidence is up. It is up, up, up. I am very pleased to be able to announce that today. We will have more to say about it in due course.

Before I address the various remarks of colleagues, I have indicated that we are backing industry and backing business. The Premier announced that agenda last week in terms of cutting red tape - slashing it, in fact - and delivering for business.

Yes, we do want a right-sized public service. We have said that consistently, with an 18 per cent increase in the size of the public service in the last five years and some 5 per cent increase in terms of the population over that period of time.

In terms of the government business enterprise reform, it is a very big reform. In fact, it is the biggest reform in more than 30 years in our state. We take it very seriously. That is why we released the discussion paper late last year. The Premier and I received feedback on that from 48 stakeholders in business, industry, unions and others. We have taken that on board. We have delivered the first tranche of what you would call 'low-hanging fruit' in terms of those government business reforms last week. That is out there for public feedback and comment for six weeks. We are taking it very seriously.

The Premier is absolutely smack on in terms of the reform. That is what we want to do. We want to do what is best for Tasmania. We are not ruling in; we are not ruling out. We have made it clear that Hydro is not for sale.

In terms of going through a process and setting up a process, yes, we will be taking on board the advice of Saul Eslake, and I say thank you to Saul for his willingness to participate. Having engaged with Saul in recent times and in my first week in the Treasury role in terms of the Eslake report and our fiscal strategy going forward, I am very pleased that we will get Saul Eslake's views on what is best for Tasmania in terms of the pros and the cons, delivering improved customer service, the economic cost-benefit analysis for the community, and what is best for Tasmania at the end of the day. 

All this reform agenda is on the back of the fact that we have reached a record in terms of our gross state product: $40.6 billion for our economy, and $48.9 billion in state final demand, which was announced last week. It is encouraging news. Again, that is another record in terms of spending within the state. We have hit record retail trade again in the last month. I am not surprised to see the NAB survey saying that business confidence is the highest in Australia. That is a massive turnaround in just the last two reports from NAB coming from near last to first. It is really encouraging.

That is on the back of what we would say is historic low unemployment and more than 45,000 jobs in the last 10 years. There has been reference today to vulnerable Tasmanians. In terms of concessions, we are certainly amongst the highest commitment across the nation in terms of providing concessions to Tasmanians doing it tough. We are committed to our electricity prices for regulated residential customers and small business customers being the lowest or amongst the lowest in Australia on the back of - as the Premier has indicated over the last few days in the parliament - a 65 per cent increase under Labor when they were in government.
I will address the various remarks and questions, but what we have heard today is a lot of whingeing from state Labor: a lot of whingeing and scaremongering and not many solutions. Frankly, it is all scare, no solutions, and that is really disappointing. There have been a lot of complaints about debt, but what we know about debt in Tasmania is that it is manageable and that we have a pathway to surplus. I have made that clear. I have expressed that view. The Premier has indicated that we are plotting a pathway to surplus and that remains the commitment of our government.

In terms of debt management, it is the third lowest in terms of the debt compared to growth state product and equal either to the lowest or second lowest for debt per person, so it is manageable. It is sustainable, but we have a lot of work to do to grow the economy. We will stand shoulder to shoulder with business and industry to get the job done. 

In terms of state Labor, they have made their position clear. They want to milk the GBEs and make them more profitable, so in terms of the commitment there, that is clearly increasing those costs, whether it be for bus fares, electricity prices or whatever costs there are to the public. That is where those costs will flow from state Labor.

Mr Willie, my shadow, said in his response, 'Privatisation is a failed experiment'. At the federal level, we have seen a federal government previously own a bank; they previously owned an airline; they previously owned a telecommunications company and a health insurance company, and all that changed under previous Labor governments at the federal level. I draw that to your attention to remind you of that and also remind you of state Labor's commitment in terms of TOTE Tasmania and its sale. In 2009, they announced the decision to sell the TOTE after previously saying it was not for sale. They eventually got $103 million, which I am advised was $250 million less than the purported sale price and less than the Auditor-General said it was worth. 

After also ruling out the sale of Aurora in 2009, in 2012 it was back on the table under state Labor. This is interesting. The Premier had an example earlier today of the Hobart Port Corporation, which was owned by the government, and frankly, look what has happened. You can see the investment of the private sector in the Hobart Airport now becoming an International Airport, with considerable investment in that airport. The public would agree that that investment has been really welcome and appreciated. They have the cart before the horse and, frankly, got their arguments all upside down.

Mr Winter again made some serious allegations with regard to asset sales, but the facts speak for themselves - res ipsa loquitur. State Labor has had a history of it with federal Labor and various Labor and other governments on the mainland in various jurisdictions. I could go on, but I will not because I want to address some of the queries and questions that have been put by members during the debate.

We have a very strong agenda. We, as a government, with regard to our budget, are absolutely responsible for our decisions, accountable for our actions and it is important to be that way. As I have started off with the business confidence being the top in Australia, certainly when Labor was in government it was the worst in the nation, unemployment was more than 8 per cent and we were in recession, 10 000 jobs were lost and those productive industries were brought to their knees, particularly the forest industry. Having said that, I indicate that the scare campaign and no solutions from state Labor is, frankly, not going to cut the mustard. I have still not received an alternative budget from the other side, no costed policies, nothing.
There was a reference by my shadow and, indeed, the Leader for the Opposition with respect to the former government and what they left in debt. They tried to deny it. Let me correct the record for those opposite. We did not inherit 'no debt'. The 2013-14 budget paper makes it clear:

It is estimated that net debt will be $226 million as at 30 June 2014 and will increase in 20 -

Members interjecting.

Dr Broad - What was it?

The SPEAKER - Order. The Deputy Premier has the call. The gap was not an invitation, Dr Broad.

Mr BARNETT - I will read the quote again -

It is estimated that net debt will be $226.1 million as at 30 June 2014 and will increase in 2015.

Labor and the Greens together chartered a pathway to debt for us, then the Revised Estimates Report that was released in February 2014 and the risk report which was requested by Treasury to prepare after we took over the budget we were left with, showed net debt was not zero, but was pushing almost half-a-billion dollars and net debt was forecast to increase to over $400 million by 2016-17. Not only that, they raided the superannuation provision account.

We all remember that and they are acting as though they are denying it or it did not exist. That was one and a half billion dollars of taxpayer money and that was left to the Liberal government to deal with that liability, and it was completely unfunded. State Labor left us a completely unfunded superannuation guarantee account. We inherited a budget that was full of debt and a broken economy. We have rebuilt it and here we are today.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left.

Mr BARNETT - Our priority is to grow our economy, create more jobs and we have got the business confidence facts and figures out the door today, which is so encouraging. 

We have a plan and a strong fiscal strategy that charts a pathway to surplus by 2029-30. We will return to this point in a responsible way, a measured way of balancing the needs to invest in our state, support our community and rebuild our fiscal buffers.

There was a question about the Department of Health. I want to make it clear with regard to health services and the cost of providing those health services. They are a priority. $345 million is obviously the bulk of the funds we are seeking through this bill. We have seen this increase in costs of locums and agency staff, the challenges of recruiting permanent staff. We are not alone. It is consistent across other jurisdictions. As former health minister, I am very aware of other concerns in other jurisdictions which are similar to our own. We want our healthcare professionals to come to Tasmania and to stay in Tasmania.
My department has been working hard with the Department of Health to ensure the 2025-26 budget reflects an appropriate level of expenditure, recognising that the agency must be looking at ways to deliver efficiencies, but also to ensure realistic expenditure that ensures that we can deliver health services to our community. We will always provide the highest quality healthcare services to the Tasmanian community wherever possible. 

Similarly, in the 2025-26 budget development process, we will ensure that the level of funding provided to parks is appropriate and reflects the cost of providing services to the users of our beautiful parks.

Let me respond to some of those other questions that came through in the time available. In terms of parks, just to flesh that out because I know Ms Badger and others questioned that, the funding of $8 million for the 2024-25 was provided in the revised Estimates Report for operating costs for parks. A further $24 million was reflected in the forward Estimates. I think Mr Bayley was asking about this, and so, as part of the 2025-26 budget development process, we will be reviewing the level of operating funding for parks to ensure that it is appropriate and accurately reflects the operating costs. I hope that assists the member.

In terms of the contingency funding, again Mr Bayley asked about this, the government will not be establishing a contingency fund for severe weather events. The Treasurer's Reserve provides a contingency for unforeseen events. Where amounts are significant, a supplementary appropriation bill is the most appropriate mechanism for funding unforeseen expenditure. 

Ms Burnet was asking about injured workers. The amount of the supplementary appropriation is to fund the difference between the Tasmanian Risk Management Fund (TRMF) premium, which is $32.9 million, and the allocated workers compensation budget of $18.4 million. The increase in the premium is driven by an increase in the number of workers compensation cases and increased complexity of individual cases leading to an increase in costs. There has been a significant increase in the number of psychological claims. These claims represent approximately 25 per cent of the total and I would add to that, psychological claims costs of approximately $254,300 per claim compared to non-psychological claims of approximately $31,200 per claim, so some eight times the difference. The increase in claims also correlates to the timing of the legislative changes relating to the presumptive post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the removal of step down provisions.

There has been a number of questions from honourable members about TasRail. Ms Burnet was one of those. TasRail's Above Rail business has historically operated largely at break-even but is facing losses over the planning period. TasRail has begun a program of identifying opportunities to increase the performance of its Above Rail operations. However, it is constrained in its ability to materially improve its financial outlook using internal expenditure controls or by significantly increasing its freight volumes and margins. TasRail operates in a competitive freight market environment and its ability to raise prices is constrained by market forces. Similarly, its volume growth opportunities are marginal. TasRail also has limited capacity to reduce its operating expenses without reducing the volume, reliability and safety of its services.

The Below Rail business is primarily funded by the government's Below Rail infrastructure contribution and this is not yet paced with cost escalations in the Below Rail business and is no longer sufficient to cover its direct operating expenses and overheads. Therefore, $1 million per annum was provided in the 2024-25 budget to TasRail as an equity contribution through Finance-General. This bill provides $8 million to ensure its financial sustainability this year and further work will be put in during now and the budget on 29 May with respect to that and a whole range of other initiatives for which I am speaking today.

There were questions about Group 6 Metals. Pursuant to section 35 of the Tasmanian Development Act 1983, a $10 million loan was approved in 2020 to assist with the recommencement of operations at the Dolphin Tungsten Mine on King Island and since commencing operations, the mine has faced challenges in achieving a steady state of operations and recovery of tungsten through its processing plant. Group 6 Metals has attempted to resolve these performance issues on site but has not been successful to date. More work is required, and that is underway. The bill converts a $10 million loan into an equity stake in Group 6 Metals as part of a broader turnaround developed by the company and its senior lenders.

With respect to King Island, again, a bit of a shout out to King Island Dairy, and the Premier, the people of King Island and the workers and their families. Congratulations, well done. Back in Australian hands - it is wonderful news. We are singing your praise from the rooftops for all those involved. To Nick and Graeme, the joint owners, we are so pleased for you. We are backing you in 100 per cent and we are very excited indeed.

In terms of the questions about Wine Tasmania, during the election the government provided two separate commitments to Wine Tasmania, both for $1.5 million over three years. The description of the election commitments was very similar and, as a result, the grant to Wine Tasmania to support the wine industry with export market development activities and domestic market promotion was overlooked. Due to the timing of identifying this issue, the amount was unable to be built into the 2024-25 Budget.

In terms of Bethlehem House, which was noted in the contributions by members, this item related to a post budget commitment which was considered important after the finalisation of the 2024-25 Budget.

Again, there were a number of contributions on the Tasmanian Prison Service. It has sustained high prisoner numbers, and that continual growth combined with a shortage of correctional officers continues to place the Tasmanian Prison Service under significant staffing and cost pressures. Additional funding is required to meet the growing prisoner population and to continue the safe operation of existing prison infrastructure. The Tasmania Prison Service continues to experience significant growth in prisoner numbers, increasing from 622 on 1 July 2018 to 806 on 1 July 2024, a 30 per cent increase over six years, with a high of 826 on 24 June 2024, I am advised. While COVID-19 temporarily reduced the number of prisoners accommodated within the Tasmanian Prison Service, it has also had a long-lasting effect on delivery of prisoner management services, increasing the complexity of rostering and the management of staff.

In terms of the question that I think Ms Badger asked with respect to the Tourism Aviation Fund, this was a top-up of the existing fund in terms of the response to the Spirits and for other purposes - $5 million. I think you have seen that both airports are very appreciative of that, as well as the tourism industry operators themselves and the Tourism Industry Council and others.

There were questions about Ashley. There are currently 18 staff suspended at Ashley, I am advised. All of these suspensions are under ED4 and ED5 provisions. Of the 18 staff, 5 employees are currently receiving workers compensation.

That is a short summary in terms of the questions of members. In terms of the Lands Titles Office, Mr Bayley, that is not a business as you indicated, but it is something that in other jurisdictions is consistently being considered for not operating within the government service. That is something that is being carefully considered by our government going forward.

I think I have answered the questions about Parks and Wildlife and the weather events. 

I appreciate the contributions of the member for Hobart, Kristie Johnston, the member for Braddon, Craig Garland, and the various members of the opposition and other members of the Greens. Thank you very much for the contributions and the broad indication of support for the bill to pass to ensure the operations of government continue.

I respect the views of those in this Chamber, but strongly disagree with many of them. I wanted to make it clear that we have a plan. We have an agenda. We are getting on with that as a government. I am very pleased to be able to indicate that there is a lot of work going into the preparation of the 29 May budget. I thank the department and all those who have made submissions with respect to what it should look like and so on, but it will be sustainable. There will be an indication, as the Premier has indicated and as I have indicated, of a pathway to surplus by 2029-30. That remains the same. We will have more to say about that, but there is a lot of work that is required to progress that.

In conclusion, thank you to all those that have made a contribution today. If I have missed anything, I am more than happy to respond to members directly and to assist members in their understanding of this very important bill. As I said, we provided a full briefing for all those members who were interested. I think many were, for which I am very grateful. I am very keen to support this Appropriation (Supplementary Appropriation for 2024-25) Bill 2025.

[5.23 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Minister for Justice) - Deputy Speaker, I move -
That the bill be now read a second time.

Together with other states and territories, Tasmania has committed to introducing reforms to the model defamation provisions to ensure ongoing national uniformity in this area of law. The reforms were developed through the Stage 2 Review of the model defamation provisions and recently agreed on a majority basis by the Standing Council of Attorneys-General (SCAG). The Defamation Amendment Bill 2024 will amend Tasmania's Defamation Act 2005 to fulfil this commitment.

By way of background, in November 2004, after agreement by Attorneys-General, all states and territories enacted the original model defamation provisions through legislation. All states and territories are parties to the Model Defamation Provisions Intergovernmental Agreement, which, amongst other things, establishes the model defamation law working party that supports and reports to SCAG on our proposals to amend the model defamation provisions.

In 2018 the then Council of Attorneys-General reconvened the model defamation law working party to review the model defamation provisions. New South Wales led the Stage 1 Review, which was conducted over 2019 and 2020. The Stage 1 amendments were enacted in Tasmania by the Defamation Amendment Act 2021. During the Stage 1 review, Attorneys-General agreed that a second reform process should be undertaken to address other significant issues.

The Stage 2 Review of the model defamation provisions consisted of two parts. Part A, led by New South Wales, addressed the question of digital intermediary liability for the publication of third-party content. Part B, led by Victoria, considered whether absolute privilege should be extended to cover reports of criminal and unlawful conduct such as sexual harassment and sexual assault to police and other complaints-handling bodies.

The Stage 2 Review involved detailed policy analysis and included extensive national public consultation, which I will now outline. In April 2021, a discussion paper was released which received about 50 written submissions. There were four stakeholder roundtables held by New South Wales in September and October 2021.

In August 2022, exposure draft model amendments and accompanying policy papers were released for public consultation. There were 36 written submissions in response to the Part A exposure draft amendments. A large roundtable was also held to discuss stakeholder views on Part A.

The model defamation law working party carefully considered all stakeholder feedback and submissions received through the Stage 2 Review. Stakeholder engagement was essential to the development and refinement of the stage 2 reforms. Further, New South Wales and Victoria sought advice from their respective defamation expert panels throughout the stage 2 review. I extend my thanks to New South Wales and Victoria for leading the national consultation processes, to the expert panels and to all stakeholders for their constructive feedback.

On 22 September 2023, the Standing Council of Attorneys-General approved by majority the final amendments to Part A and Part B, subject to some jurisdictions' Cabinet processes, where necessary. Uniformity remains a key objective of the model defamation provisions. SCAG agreed that jurisdictions in the majority will use their best endeavours to enact Part A and Part B amendments for commencement on 1 July 2024, and I am pleased to be progressing Tasmania's commitment with this bill.

There was also agreement that there should be a review of the stage 1 and stage 2 amendments that begins no later than three years after the commencement of stage 2 amendments in all implementing states and territories.

The bill enacts the Model Defamation Amendment (Digital Intermediaries) Provisions 2023 and the Model Defamation Amendment (Absolute Privilege) Provisions 2023. 

I will now outline the policy rationale and details of the Part A amendments, before turning to the Part B amendments. Part A Digital Intermediaries: defamation law has struggled to keep pace with the emergence and pervasiveness of digital or online communications. Defamation law developed over hundreds of years when publishing was generally a privileged and professional activity subject to editorial standards, where most high-profile defamation cases involved prominent public figures suing mainstream media companies. In modern Australia, anyone with an internet connection is able to publish to the world at large. Online publication is made possible by digital intermediaries that play various roles in the publication process for user-generated or third-party content. Digital intermediaries range from internet service providers to internet content hosts, social media platforms, search engines and review websites, to name just a few.

Under the common law, the test for publication in defamation is very broad. Essentially, anyone who contributes to any extent to the publication of defamatory matter is a publisher. This means that nearly all digital intermediaries are likely to be considered publishers of third-party content in defamation law.

Several recent cases have considered the issue of digital intermediary liability for third-party content. These cases have demonstrated the complex questions that arise, as well as the potential for long and costly disputes. Stakeholders and legal experts have raised concerns that current Australian defamation law in this area is unclear and inconsistent. 

A key recent example in the status and liability of forum administrators following the High Court decision in the case of Fairfax Media Publications Pty Ltd and Others v Voller, 2021 High Court of Australia 27. In Voller, a majority of the High Court held that several media companies were publishers of comments posted on their public Facebook pages by third-party users responding to news stories they had posted. All types of forum administrators, whether they are individuals, volunteers or small organisations, politicians or media companies, have been impacted by the Voller decision. Some forum administrators have elected to turn off comments on their forums to avoid potential liability. The state of defamation law, as it applies to forum administrators currently, is not acceptable. A major part of the Part A reforms is a new defence that is designed to make the law clearer and more certain for all digital intermediaries.

The reforms being enacted in the bill strike a better balance between protecting reputations and not unreasonably limiting freedom of expression in the various circumstances where third parties publish defamatory matter via digital intermediaries. The bill provides a pragmatic response to all digital intermediary functions.

The bill provides six key reforms:

A conditional exemption from defamation liability for conduit caching and storage services, and for search engines in relation to organic search results.

Updates to the mandatory requirements for an offer to make amends for online publications.

A requirement for courts to consider balancing factors when making preliminary discovery orders against digital intermediaries.

A new innocent dissemination defence for digital intermediaries, subject to a simple complaints process.

A specific power for courts to make non-party orders against digital intermediaries to prevent access to defamatory matter online.

Expanded electronic means by which notices can be delivered.

 [Bookmark: _Hlk192614407] A conditional exemption from defamation liability for conduit caching and storage services, and for search engines in relation to organic search results.

Updates to the mandatory requirements for an offer to make amends for online publications.
A requirement for courts to consider balancing factors when making preliminary discovery orders against digital intermediaries.

A new innocent dissemination defence for digital intermediaries, subject to a simple complaints process.

A specific power for courts to make non-party orders against digital intermediaries to prevent access to defamatory matter online.

Expanded electronic means by which notices can be delivered.

I will now outline some of the key reforms in further detail. Clause 6 of the bill establishes a conditional exemption from defamation liability for three specific digital intermediary functions:

A caching service that stores content temporarily to make onward transmission more efficient will be exempted. This includes files commonly downloaded from a website temporarily and automatically stored to speed up the download time.

A conduit service, the principal function of which is to enable users to connect with the internet, send data or receive data will be exempted. This includes internet or email service providers.

A storage service, the principal function of which is to enable users to store content remotely will be exempted. An example is a cloud service provider that enables users to store photos for later retrieval.

This recognises the passive role of digital intermediaries in these contexts and, importantly, the exemption only applies in a narrow set of circumstances.

The Stage 2 review also considered the functions performed by search engine providers, and it was ultimately concluded that a conditional exemption for search engine providers in relation to organic search results is appropriate. Again, the exemption is designed to apply very narrowly.

One of the objects of the Defamation Act is to promote speedy and non-litigious methods of dispute resolution. Part 3 of the act establishes a procedure to enable parties to settle disputes without the need for expensive litigation by encouraging a publisher to make a reasonable offer to make amends to the aggrieved person. If the aggrieved person does not accept a reasonable offer in all the circumstances, the publisher may rely on their offer to make amends as a defence in any subsequent defamation action against them. The bill improves this process, including by providing that an offer to make amends may include 'an offer to take access prevention steps in relation to the matter'. This amendment broadens the provision by allowing a publisher to offer to remove, block, disable or otherwise prevent access to the matter. The bill also amends the relevant elements to provide for the making of corrections and to take reasonable steps to advise other publishers that the matter may be defamatory.

Many originators who post defamatory material online do so using a pseudonym. To commence defamation proceedings, the plaintiff must identify and locate the originator. Plaintiffs are able to obtain preliminary discovery orders from Australian courts requiring a digital intermediary to disclose information concerning the originator's identity. Courts already can and do consider proportionality, privacy and the risk of abuse of process in exercising the discretion to make preliminary discovery orders. However, there may still be a risk that such orders are abused or have a chilling effect.

The proposed new section 23A provides that, before making an order for preliminary discovery, the Court must take into account the objects of the act and any privacy, safety or other public interest considerations. This does not provide a new avenue to seek preliminary discovery; it simply applies this requirement over the general rules. This will promote consistency across jurisdictions. It is also in the interest of protecting domestic violence victims and other vulnerable members of society who may be using a pseudonym online due to safety concerns.

One of the most significant reforms progressed in the bill is the introduction of a new innocent dissemination defence for digital intermediaries. The new defence recognises that digital intermediaries should not be liable for defamatory content where they are merely a subordinate distributor and lack actual knowledge of the content in question. Once the digital intermediary has received a written complaint about a publication, it must take reasonable steps, if available, to remove or otherwise prevent access to the matter within seven days in order to rely on the defence.

The new defence has been designed to avoid the problems that have been identified with the application of the existing section 32 innocent dissemination defence to digital intermediaries. The new defence provides that the plaintiff must have given the digital intermediary a written complaint containing certain basic information to put the digital intermediary on notice. The defence gives a clear timeframe in which action needs to be taken to rely on the defence and the defence is available to digital intermediaries that moderate and remove content that may be defamatory. 

The bill provides requirements for a written complaint in relation to this. Importantly, the defence is defeated if the defendant was motivated by malice in establishing or providing the online service for which the digital matter was published. Malice as a disqualifying concept is used throughout the model defamation provisions.

The bill assists complainants where content has gone 'viral' and is hard to remove or the publisher has refused to assist. Despite not being party to the proceedings, digital intermediaries may be in a good position to assist a plaintiff in these cases. The new section 39A would explicitly empower a court to make an order against a digital intermediary who is not a party to the proceedings to take access prevention steps or other steps the court considers necessary to prevent or limit the continued publication or republication of the matter. That would apply in circumstances where the court has granted interim or final judgment for the plaintiff in a defamation action, for example, against the originator.

The Part A reforms enacted in the bill are the result of a significant reform process and address complex issues arising from modern digital communications. The bill does not affect fundamental principles of defamation law such as publication, but are designed to provide certainty and clarity for both plaintiffs and digital intermediaries. The right balance has been struck between protecting reputations and freedom of expression in the context of the very modern challenges now faced by defamation law.

I will now turn to Stage 2 review, Part B reforms and Part B is about absolute privilege. Part B reforms address the concern that the threat of potential defamation proceedings may deter people from making complaints to police forces and other complaint-handling bodies. 

My thanks again to Victoria for leading the Part B reforms. To explain this amendment in more detail, it is helpful to look at the law as it stands. Currently, it is a defence under both the general law and section 27 of the Defamation Act if the defendant is in proceedings for the publication of defamatory matters proves the publication occurred on the occasion of absolute privilege. 

It is also a defence under both the general law and section 30 of the Defamation Act if the defendant proves the publication occurred on occasion of qualified privilege. Currently, the defence of absolute privilege does not apply generally to matters published to police forces and in such cases, the defendant would typically rely on the defence of qualified privilege as a defence for these kinds of publications. 

Stakeholder feedback has indicated that the defence of qualified privilege does not provide a sufficient safeguard against the deterrent effect of defamation liability, especially as there is uncertainty about the kinds of publications that will attach the defence of qualified privilege at general law.

The bill extends the defence of absolute privilege to publications of matter to police officers. This amendment will support complainants to report conduct to the police, such as sexual and other forms of harassment, where threats of defamation have been used to pressure victims into silence.

The SCAG also agreed that states and territories can extend absolute privilege to matters published to other complaint-handling bodies by listing relevant bodies in schedule one of individual jurisdictions, defamation legislation. SCAG endorsed guiding principles to be used by jurisdictions to determine relevant bodies to be listed for the purposes of Stage 2, Part B reforms. The guiding principles provides that jurisdictions are to consider the Part B objectives and whether the body falls within one or more of the following categories of bodies: human rights and anti-discrimination bodies; statutory investigative bodies; or professional disciplinary bodies.

A further consideration of the guiding principles is that the body has functions under the legislation or is established by legislation to receive and handle complaints about conduct where there is a risk of defamation law having a chilling effect on reporting including, for example, sexual, domestic and family violence, sexual harassment, bullying, discrimination or vilification and/or conduct in breach of human rights.

The body also must have sufficient safeguards to protect against the making of false and misleading reports and ensure the integrity of the process for making and handling complaints. This bill lists the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner and any member of their staff in Schedule 1 of the Defamation Act which will provide that the defence of absolute privilege applies to matters published to the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner.

The Anti-Discrimination Commissioner investigates complaints of direct and indirect discrimination, sexual harassment, victimisation and inciting hatred and promoting discrimination and prohibited conduct. Relevantly, the Anti-Discrimination Act 1998 contains sufficient safeguards to protect against the making of false and misleading reports. The conduct for which complaints may be made to the Commissioner align with the conduct contemplated by the Part B guiding principles and along with the amendment to include reports to Tasmania Police. The vast majority of reporting of this conduct will be protected and encouraged by the bill.

States and territories may add to their act's Schedule 1 at any time, and the government will continue to monitor this issue and consider the appropriateness of listing other complaint handling bodies in the future. The bill also contains savings and transitional provisions for the amendments. The amendments will apply to publications after the amendments commenced, while the existing law will continue to apply to publications before the commencement.

In addition to the thorough consultation processes that occurred throughout the development of the model defamation provisions, a consultation version of the bill was made available for public comment through the Department of Justice website, with targeted stakeholders being advised by email. I thank those stakeholders who provided input and it is positive to see that there is support for these reforms. 

This is an important bill. It implements the nationally agreed model defamation amendments and fulfils Tasmania's commitment to states and territories in respect of the stage two reform. 

I commend the bill to the House.
[5.44 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I am glad to make a contribution on behalf of the Labor opposition to the Defamation Amendment Bill 2024. We have heard in great detail the effect of the bill from the Attorney-General, and it is important to note at the outset that this bill will implement national model law that has been agreed by the Standing Council of Attorneys-General - the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) committee with the weirdest acronym, SCAG - and that it is important that each state and territory does the domestic work required to implement that national law reform. Part of the reason for that is that defamation is something that can affect anybody in any jurisdiction, and it is important that the states and territories laws align, which is one of the very reasons why model law provisions exist in a range of different legislative areas.

I recognise the work that the Standing Council and their working groups have done, and we have heard that in detail from the Attorney-General as well. This is Stage 2 of the national review of defamation law and as we heard the Attorney-General say, Stage 2 was split into two parts, and this bill implements both of those parts. New South Wales led the work on Part A of Stage 2 and Victoria led the work on Part B of Stage 2.

Defamation law is one of those really important areas of law that protects the rights of people to maintain their reputation as well as the rights of people to expose wrongdoing, but it is one of those areas of law that was written when it was legislated, but also with regard to the build-up of common law around defamation - in an environment before online methods of communication existed or before they existed to the extent that they do today. I believe that it is one of those areas of law for which it is important for jurisdictions around our country and the world to make sure that their legislation remains contemporary and can deal with a changed way of operating and of communicating information.

Communicating information online presents a raft of challenges for legislatures to deal with, and one of those is making sure that defamation law remains contemporary and effective in an online digital environment. I note that, as the Attorney-General also said, the changes in this bill do not make substantive changes to the way that defamation law has always operated, but they make changes that are necessary to ensure that it can remain contemporary and operate in an online environment.

Part A of Stage 2 of this National Review by SCAG deals with the question of digital intermediaries - online platforms for want of a better word - and their liability for the publication of third-party content. That goes to the question of who is liable for defamation action when something is communicated online? It is important to remember that publication in terms of defamation law does not just mean publication that we might first think of, such as publicly publishing something in a newspaper, on television, on the radio or on an online platform, but it can actually just mean communicating information between two individuals or a group of individuals. It is important that digital platforms, like email hosts for example, are not the body considered liable for defamation action if someone e-mails something defamatory to another person.

That person emailing the defamatory information is still going to be potentially liable for action in defamation, but it should not be Gmail or Hotmail. I am showing my age by talking about Hotmail, but it should not be that email provider who is potentially liable for defamation action. That is part of what Part A of stage 2 of this reform deals with. It provides definitions of what those digital platforms are, and they might be services like cloud-based storage services, website hosting services, services that store cached information, conduit services such as email providers and so on.

It is important to note, though, that the model law and this bill deals with social media platforms in a slightly different way, recognising that social media platforms have at least some level of control over what appears on their platforms. Similarly, people who host their own websites or people who provide information on a website. The defence that is provided for those social media platforms goes to that detail, and that is that there are mechanisms - clunky as they might be - for people to seek to have information removed from online platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter - now X - and others, and they are already required to have a process in place for members of the public to seek to have information removed.

I note that it is something that is pretty challenging and not something that is really possible for the Tasmanian or even Australian parliaments to deal with in its entirety. There were attempts last year, for example, for Twitter - now X - to have beheading videos removed and they were unsuccessful. There was an argument from some that that was an impingement on free speech. Whatever you think about that, it is really important that defamation law strikes a balance between protecting people's right to raise information of concern and exercise their free speech, particularly when it comes to raising potentially criminal activity, and balancing that need with the right for people not to be subjected to damage to reputation that might be considered unfair or frivolous. 

Defamation law has always had to manage that balance. In my view, that is what Part B of the Stage 2 Review of the model laws does, and that is to deal with the issue of absolute and qualified privilege. What this bill will do is extend absolute privilege to information shared with police or shared with the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner. I think that that is a reasonable and cautious way to proceed, by just naming up those two statutory authorities or public sector agencies.

I note that there is the ability for the government down the track to add other bodies. It might be relevant in the future to add other investigative bodies such as the Ombudsman or others to that list of bodies that are able to receive information, with the person sharing that information enjoying, for want of a better word, absolute privilege in their ability to share that information. That does not mean that that information is suddenly in the broader public domain, but it means that that person is protected in sharing that information potentially for criminal action to be taken or for an anti-discrimination matter to be conducted.

That is important. It is important that legislative changes like this strike that balance, because according absolute privilege to anybody is something that should be treated cautiously. For that reason, the Standing Council published guidelines to assist states in making those decisions. The guiding principles were considered by government in naming up both police and the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner as those two bodies named in the schedule. Those guiding principles, or what is to be considered by jurisdictions in considering extending absolute privilege to matters published to complaint handling bodies in scope of Part B reforms, include:

To protect individuals reporting alleged criminal and unlawful conduct or misconduct to specified complaints handling bodies from defamation liability;

To provide transparency about when absolute privilege extends to a matter published to a body through a referrable list;

To limit the protection of absolute privilege to specific confidential settings; and

To strike the right balance between protecting people who want to report alleged criminal and unlawful conduct and misconduct, and protecting alleged perpetrators from unjust reputational damage.

As I said, it is important that governments and parliaments tread cautiously in assigning absolute privilege. I think that that has happened in this circumstance, and I think other states and territories have similarly trodden cautiously in terms of the bodies that are named up in their schedules to their implementation of the model laws.

The bill also makes other changes, stepping back to Part A of Stage 2, that are again from that model law about the online digital environment, as well as providing that information around conduit caching and storage services and for search engines. It updates the mandatory requirements for an offer to make amends for online publications. It makes it a requirement for courts to consider balancing factors when making preliminary discovery orders against digital intermediaries. It makes a new innocent dissemination defence for digital intermediary subject to a simple complaints process. It creates a specific power for courts to make non-party orders against digital intermediaries to prevent access to different defamatory matter online.

Further, it contains expanded electronic means by which notices can be delivered. Finally, it makes an extension to absolute privilege - that is part (b) that I have just gone through. That is a matter published to police and the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner. 

It is important that Tasmania's laws keep pace with changes recommended by standing councils of COAG, in this case the Standing Council of Attorneys-General. I recognise the amount of work conducted by both New South Wales and Victoria in providing these model laws for their state counterparts to implement. Equally, I recognise the work that has gone into this bill by the Attorney-General's department and thank his officers for the briefing today - Catherine from his office, and Bruce and Isabella, who are in the Chamber today. Also, Felicity and Nicole, who attended the briefing today and have had involvement with this and other bills.

I do not feel it is necessary for me to go through the level of detail the Attorney-General did in terms of all of the changes this bill achieves, other than those comments I have put on the record just now. I look forward to the continuing discussion on this bill and providing the opposition support.

[5.58 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, the Greens will be supporting the bill before us today. I thank the Attorney-General for bringing it on and also the many people who have worked on this legislation before us around the country. As other members have said, this is a collaborative work. It is good to see that there has been, from what I have read, quite a degree of good will and serious intent across all jurisdictions in the Standing Council of Attorneys-General.

The original defamation bill work that was done was in 2005. When the work was done by the Victorian and New South Wales governments' justice bodies on the two parts of this bill, Part A and Part B, that work was done in the context of an understanding that we had gone a very long way from 2005 to 2025 when it comes to the rapid changes in the digital environment that we all live and breathe every single day. It was obvious there was a desperate need to update this work. 

In so doing, the Greens have always been staunch defenders of people's right to protect their reputation, to protect their self and personhood from defaming comments made against them, as well as staunch defenders of people's right to freedom of expression and, essentially, to be able to speak out against the misuse or abuse of power. In that instance, we could see the abuse of power by bosses in workplaces, by organisations exerting power and trying to silence people and have a chilling effect over people speaking out against acts of injustice, acts of harm that are caused to people in social life and in workplaces standing up to protect wild places in defence of future generations, and all the other manners in which people speak out. 

It is an important balance to strike carefully because a push too far in either direction would be a gross injustice, not just for individuals but for all of us as a social body in being able to collectively protect ourselves from organisations and individuals behaving badly. 

What I see here is a history of people working in Victoria and New South Wales to make some very careful adjustments to defamation law we have in Tasmania and other states, based on the federal model guidelines. They have come up with some responses to the significant developments we now see in the technological and digital environments. These are in response particularly to bodies that hold potentially damaging material that could be considered to be defamatory, but using it in a different way than has been traditionally, historically used. This includes the movement and storage of information we have talked about via caching, cloud storage, through emails or with intermediary bodies who employ and manage search engines. They ought not to be held responsible for information that has been sought by another person when they are just providing what we would all probably agree is an essential service. These are some of the situations that have been attended to in this legislation.

It also clarifies when digital intermediaries, including social media platforms, are liable for defamatory material and when they are not. In that way, it seeks to strike this balance between protecting a person's individual reputation without unreasonably limiting our freedom of expression online.

It also contains protections for victim/survivors. I would like the Attorney-General - is the Attorney-General here? The Attorney-General has just ducked out. I will save that question.

There are whole range of defences against defamation contained in our Defamation Act 2005, amended substantially in 2021, that provide defences to an allegation of defamation. They are important defences to enable courts to make sure that we are able to strike the balance between protecting people's reputation and not having a chilling effect on people's reasonable right to voice concern, outrage, dismay, disgust at matters of injustice, personal abuse or maltreatment. 

These defences in our Tasmanian legislation include the defence of contextual truth, of absolute privilege for the publication of public documents, for the fair reporting of proceedings of public concern, for the publication of matters of public interest, for the provision of certain information for scientific or academic peer review, a defence of honest opinion and one of innocent dissemination of materials. Regarding that last one, many of the things that are in the amendment bill before us are about the dissemination of material, but in a new form, in a digital form, in addition to the way the dissemination of material is treated under our existing act, as it stands.

The question I had for the Attorney-General is, since the amendments were made to the Victorian and New South Wales laws following the work that they did on the amendments that we have before us, has there been any comment that you are aware of about deficiencies, the gaps in what we have before us today? As you said before sitting here today, we do not know what the landscape is going to look like digitally in a year's time, let alone in five years' time, and it was 20 years since the first defamation act came through this place in Tasmania. It is a long time, but I believe everyone is grappling with what truth means in an artificial intelligence world and who has the responsibility for dealing with AI-generated material. Obviously, the person who generates it is responsible for it, but is consideration being given to the role of artificial intelligence and how that might play into any of the amendments that we have within this bill?

It is not a matter that is relevant to the bill before us today, but I am interested if you would be able to tell us where legal minds are putting their thoughts for the near future on these sorts of issues. I know that there is a huge concern in the community to have an early legislative response to the rapidly changing digital landscape, to make sure that disinformation, false images and the transfer of those images is curtailed. What we have before us will make a really big difference and we strongly support the amendments that are here today, but anything else in that landscape I would be interested to hear if the Attorney-General is aware of anything. 

Thank you and thank your staff, Attorney-General for the work they have done on this. We will be looking forward to having more clarity in this space than we have had before.

[6.09 p.m.]
Mr FAIRS (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, it is important to understand the framework that governs defamation law in Australia. Defamation is a civil action determined by courts. It is designed to balance the right of freedom of speech with protecting a person's reputation against harm. In Australia, defamation law is determined by state and territory legislation. However, model defamation provisions (MDP) were agreed in 2005 and each state and territory enacted legislation to implement the provisions, meaning there is a nationally-consistent approach, where possible.

As the Attorney-General has said, together with other states and territories, Tasmania has committed to introducing reforms to the model defamation provisions to ensure ongoing national uniformity in this area of law. This bill will enact the Model Defamation Amendment Provisions agreed to by the Standing Council of Attorneys-General at its meeting on 22 September 2023. The SCAG Stage 2 review of the Model Defamation Provisions was conducted since 2021 and involved detailed policy analysis and two rounds of national public consultation.

The Stage 2 review comprised of two parts. Part A was led by New South Wales and addressed the question of digital intermediary for the publication of third party content. Part B was led by Victoria and considered whether absolute privilege should be extended to cover reports of criminal and unlawful conduct such as sexual harassment and sexual assault to police and other complaints-handling bodies.

The Part A model, amendments, aim to strike a better balance between protecting reputations and not unreasonably limiting freedom of expression in the various circumstances where third parties published defamatory matter via digital platforms.

The Part B model amendments address the chilling effect that the potential threat of defamation proceedings may have on people making reports of alleged criminal and unlawful conduct or misconduct to police and some other complaints-handling bodies through consideration of agreed guiding principles.

All states and territories are parties to the model defamation provisions intergovernmental agreement. The objects of the model defamation provisions are -

to enact provisions to promote uniform laws of defamation in Australia, and

to ensure that the law of defamation does not place unreasonable limits on freedom of expression and, in particular, on the publication and discussion of matters of public interest and importance, and

to provide effective and fair remedies for persons whose reputations are harmed by the publication of defamatory matter, and

to promote speedy and non-litigious methods of resolving disputes about the publication of defamatory matter.

Members will recall several amendments to Tasmania's Defamation Act over the years, in line with our commitment to national model defamation laws, however it is important that they still reflect the Tasmanian context.

The Defamation Amendment Bill 2024 incorporates the Model Defamation Amendment Digital Intermediary Provisions 2023 and the Model Defamation Amendment Absolute Privilege Provisions 2023 drafted by the Parliamentary Councils Committee and endorsed by the Standing Council of Attorneys-General. There are no changes to the operative text of the provisions in the bill, except for Schedule 1 amendments, which the Model Defamation Amendment provisions do not cover.

There are some very minor drafting differences to reflect Tasmanian drafting conventions and styles, such as a semi colon rather than a comma at section 31A(5)(a). The location of the transitional provisions is in Schedule 6, while the model provisions have them in Part 6, which the Tasmanian act does not have, but the text remains the same.

In relation to Schedule 1, under section 27(2)(d) of the model defamation provisions, matter is published on an occasion of absolute privilege if it is published by a personal body in any circumstances rather specified in Schedule 1. This means that each state and territory has the ability to list additional circumstances to which absolute privilege applies in Schedule 1 to its defamation legislation that gives effect to the model defamation provisions. SCAG agreed on guiding principles to be used by states and territories to determine which complaints handling bodies to list in their Schedule 1 for the purpose of the Part B reform.

States and territories are taking different approaches regarding listing complaint handling bodies for the purposes of implementing the Stage 2 reforms. The Defamation Amendment Bill 2024 proposes to list the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner and their staff in Schedule 1 in line with SCAG guiding principles. The savings and transitional provisions also cover off on the proposed change to Schedule 1 which is not included in the model provisions.

This is an important bill. It implements the nationally agreed model defamation amendments and fulfils Tasmania's commitment to states and territories in respect of the Stage Two reforms. I commend the bill to the House.

[6.15 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Minister for Justice) - Honourable Speaker, I am pleased to acknowledge my shadow, the Leader for the Greens, and the member for Bass, Rob Fairs, and their contributions, support and encouragement to me as Attorney-General with respect to this important legislation. This legislation reforms Tasmanian defamation laws, broadly consistent with defamation laws around the country. I acknowledge my attorneys-general in other states. There is a reference to SCAG: it has been good to work with them and be involved in that consideration; also, prior to my involvement, the former attorney-general as well, Elise Archer. I acknowledge her involvement prior to my commencement in the role. 

This has taken many years to get to where we are today, and I am really pleased that we have landed. I acknowledge the support from my shadow and Greens spokesperson, as well as Mr Fairs. As I have said, it is very encouraging. I would like to address those concerns in my summing up and support for this bill.

It does raise a number of concerns, but I think we have got the balance right with this legislation, in terms of not just privilege, but also those intermediaries, and ensuring that we get a balance between free speech and making sure that those statements that are said are not defamatory. People have a right to express a view and respond to that as well, and I am really pleased with where we have landed. I would like to go through some of those questions Ms Haddad had about, for example, the need for a 'reasonable and cautious way to proceed with prescribing complaint handling bodies'.

I shared in my second reading speech that that needs to be considered carefully. The bill lists the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner in Schedule 1. This means that the absolute privilege that I referred to before and earlier during the debate will apply to publications to the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner or to any member of the staff of the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner. The type of conduct for which complaints may be made to the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner aligned with the conduct contemplated by the Part B guiding principles, which I shared during the second reading speech, and likewise my shadow made reference to them, together with the enacting model amendments to section 27 to include reports to Tasmania Police. The majority of reporting of Part B conduct would be protected and encouraged.

My Department of Justice will continue to consider the appropriateness of including other bodies in Schedule 1 and consult with those bodies going forward. States and territories may add to their act's Schedule 1 at any time, and further bodies may be listed or removed over time via standalone or Justice miscellaneous bills. That is the process going forward.

Ms Haddad referenced the guiding principles for extending absolute privilege, and these were applied when considering the suitability of authorities. I will not go through them all, but the Department of Justice undertook a preliminary review of Tasmanian complaint handling bodies against the Part B guidelines and principles to assess prospective bodies appropriate for listing in Schedule 1, and the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner meets the SCAG guiding principles in the following ways.

Categories of bodies included in the principles. It is covered there. Functions under legislation to receive and handle complaints where there may be a risk of defamation law having a chilling effect. There is reference to sufficient safeguards, and again I make the argument that there are sufficient safeguards in the Anti-Discrimination Act. Section 69 is an example. Subsection (2) of the act directs the commissioner or authorised staff to have regard to maintaining the confidentiality of all persons involved in the investigation of the complaints. Section 69(2) of the act directs the commissioner or authorised investigator to have regard to maintaining the confidentiality of all persons involved in the investigation. The legislation does back that in. This is a matter under review, and decisions can be made well into the future.

I should also note that the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner has been consulted throughout the development of the Part B reforms and supports being listed in Schedule 1. I think it is important for colleagues in this place and the public to be aware of that support.

The question about false reports to police and the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner - there are appropriate legislative protections to address the concern of false reports to police and the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner and that such reports will have the absolute privilege defence. Section 44A of the Police Offences Act and section 113 of the Criminal Code provide appropriate safeguards to protect alleged perpetrators from unjust reputational damage.

It is an offence to falsely make a statement to any police officer. A person who contravened section 44A is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding 100 penalty units or to imprisonment for a maximum of 12 months. Under section 113 of the Criminal Code, it is an offence to make false declarations or other statements; I draw that to your attention as well. Section 69(2) of the Anti-Discrimination Act directs the commissioner or authorised staff to have regard to maintaining confidentiality and the like, which I referred to just a few moments ago.

Dr Woodruff referenced amendments implemented in other jurisdictions, so thank you for that contribution. In terms of which other jurisdictions have commenced the Stage 2 Model Defamation Provisions, I advise that the Model Defamation Amendment Provisions were approved by the majority of members of the SCAG. Other than South Australia, all states and territories have agreed to use best endeavours to enact the Model Provisions by 1 July 2024. Reforms have commenced in New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. 

New South Wales passed the new laws early last year and their amendment commenced on 1 July 2024. The Australian Capital Territory passed their amending legislation and their provisions commenced on 1 July 2024. In Victoria, the defamation reforms in the Justice Legislation Amendment (Integrity, Defamation and Other Matters) Act 2024 commenced on 11 September 2024. In South Australia, the Defamation (Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill 2024 was introduced by the Attorney-General in the Legislative Council on 29 August 2024 and agreed to on 4 February 2025. The advice I have is that the bill is now before the House of Assembly. I am advised that Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory are yet to introduce the reforms.

I think there was a question by Dr Woodruff on behalf of the Greens with respect to the timing of the review. In September 2023, the SCAG agreed that there should be a review of Stage 1 and Stage 2 amendments to the Model Defamation Provisions and that the review is to begin no later than three years after the commencement of Stage 2 amendments in all implementing states and territories. We have moved as quickly as we possibly can to progress that, and I am pleased with the progress.

Ms Haddad - So are we.

Mr BARNETT - Good. I am glad we have support around the Chamber for the progress and I am pleased to see a smiling face and positive nodding on the other side.

Defamation cases take a long time to go through the courts. They can be very complex, and it is difficult and technical dealing with the legal constructs. It is therefore appropriate that a three-year period occur before the review is undertaken and further SCAGs will continue to consider these issues. I thank my colleagues, Attorneys-General in the SCAG, participating in this and a whole host of other law reforms.

I want to touch on this very sensitive, important, emerging issue with respect to artificial intelligence, which was raised by the Leader of the Greens. I know she is in a very important conversation there.

Dr Woodruff - Sorry.

Mr BARNETT - No, not at all. You can read the Hansard as well because I am sure it is an important conversation with my colleague, the Minister for Health.

I am responding to your queries about artificial intelligence on the record. I see this as one of the emerging issues for us in Tasmania, Australia, and across the globe. This is the next big thing. We had the industrial revolution; artificial intelligence, in my view, is coming our way. It is already here and is going to get bigger. How do we respond to it to ensure that it is human being centric and not anti our best interests? It needs to be pro our best interests. 

It is acknowledged that internet search engines are highly sophisticated and constantly evolving. There are some existing functions that go beyond automated tools to search the internet, to return search results, identifying and linking to third-party websites based on the search terms input by users. For example, the use of algorithms predicting the user's search with reference to other users' common searches, which may create a suggestion that it is itself defamatory. While this is done by algorithm, it is not a search engine function that simply connects the user to the web page of a third party. The use of algorithms in this case generates suggested word associations that may be highly defamatory and, importantly, that the search engine has the ability to remove. This would not fall within the parameters of standard search functions that are able to access the exemption. 

I am sure more could be said about that in the general debate we could all have in this place in due course with respect to artificial intelligence, and what is in our best interest and the interest of the people of Tasmania, rather than the interests of those perhaps funding the various artificial intelligence devices, frameworks and services available in our world today.

The member for Braddon, Mr Garland, is not here at the moment, but I understand he has an interest in what 'promote' means with regard to algorithms that promote controversial content. In clause 6 of the bill, clause 10C(1)(c)(v) is a conditional exemption for digital intermediaries providing caching, conduit or storage services that require that the intermediary did not promote the matter, whether before or after it was published. This exemption applies to digital intermediaries providing a caching, conduit or storage service only. These services, as defined in the bill, are limited to services typically involving passive rather than active participation in the publication of digital matter. 

Paragraph (c) provides an additional safeguard by excluding digital intermediaries who, in a particular case, take an active role in a publication of digital matter. In relation to the issue of algorithms promoting content, if any promotion occurs, the exemption does not apply.

The definition of caching, conduit and storage service will do most of the work in restricting eligibility for the exemption, and the exemption does not apply when the digital intermediaries act beyond their standard functions.

I can provide further information with respect to that question if Mr Garland, or someone in his office, wishes to contact my office directly.

I have answered the question on the timing of the review. 

Regarding the question about the exemption for search engine providers covering Google-generated questions and answers that may not have been part of the search text, again clause (6) of the bill, proposed 10D, creates an exemption from liability for a search engine provider in relation to both the publication of digital matter comprised of search results and the publication of digital matter comprised of matter on other websites to which the results facilitates access by providing a hyperlink. The exemption is conditioned because it is only available if the provider proves the provider's role was limited to providing an automated process for the user of the search engine to generate the results, and it applies only to search results generated by the search engine limited to identifying a webpage on which content is located by reference to the title of the webpage, a hyperlink to the webpage, or an extract from the webpage, and an image from the webpage. 

It excludes search results in the extent the results are promoted or prioritised by the search engine provider because of a payment or other benefit given to the provider by, or on behalf of a third party, so a sponsored search result. This is happening already. This sort of thing is consistently being promoted; sponsors of various search results are definitely at the forefront of the global Google world we live in. 

In terms of the defence of absolute privilege applying to a publication on a police Facebook page, this has been raised in a separate forum. To assist members and those in the other place, the bill proposes to amend section 27 of the Defamation Act to extend absolute privilege to a matter published to police. The provision provides that the matter is to be published to a person who, at the time of the publication, is an official of a police force or service of an Australian jurisdiction, and it is published to the official while the official is acting in an official capacity. For the defence of absolute privilege to apply, the publication needs to be to a person who at that time is acting in their official role as a police officer. This means that the defence would not apply to a person making a comment on a public community Facebook page run by the police, for example, but would apply to a person making a complaint in person, by phone or direct email to a specific police officer while that officer is on duty. There is a fine line to be drawn in some cases and I hope that assists members in understanding how this new law can and will operate.

Did the government consider whether absolute privilege should be extended to the Integrity Commission, the Ombudsman, the Health Complaints Commissioner and the National Preventative Mechanism? The government will continue to consider the appropriateness of including other bodies in schedule 1. At this stage, it is appropriate that the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner will be listed in schedule 1. In line with the guiding principles, the commissioner has functions to investigate and seek to conciliate complaints of discrimination and prohibited conduct, including sexual harassment and victimisation. 

The act contains sufficient safeguards to maintain the confidentiality of all persons involved in the investigation of complaints. The type of conduct for which complaints may be made to the commissioner align with the conduct contemplated by the Part B guiding principles, together with enacting the model amendments to section 27 to include reports to Tasmania Police. The majority of reporting of Part B conduct will be protected and encouraged by also listing reports to the Anti-Discrimination Commissioner in schedule 1.

I think the member for Clark, Kristie Johnston, had an interest in that matter. I hope that provides an answer for the member.

Is an individual a digital intermediary on Facebook when a third party posts a comment? I will not go into too much detail but, in short, the bill defines a digital intermediary, sometimes called a forum administrator, in relation to the publication of digital matter, to mean a person who provides or administers the online service by means of which the matter is published other than an author, originator or poster of the material. Importantly, the definition is not intended to alter the general law concerning when a person will be treated as the publisher of defamatory matter. A digital intermediary includes a person who administers a facility provided by an internet-based platform enabling users to share content or interact with other users about a topic. 

An example of a forum administrator is an individual who uses a facility on a social media platform to create and administer a public page for residents of their local suburb to post information and comments that may be of interest to locals. It is a good example. It happens consistently around Tasmania, the country, and elsewhere. The individual in the example is a digital intermediary because the individual is providing an online service that facilitates sharing and interaction between users of the public page. In addition, the person providing the social media platform used to create and administer the public page is also a digital intermediary in relation to publications of digital matter on the page.

The definition excludes an author, originator, or poster of the digital matter. The purpose of excluding these persons from the definition is to ensure the definition captures only persons providing an online service as an intermediary - in other words, as a subordinate publisher. In the example where a third party posts a comment on individual A's Facebook post that defames Person B, for example, it is important to acknowledge that the context will be relevant to determine how the defence may apply. Factors such as if it is a private page, or if any Facebook user can access and provide comments, may be relevant, meaning a more public page. In this example, individual A would likely be a forum administrator because they are administering their own Facebook page by means of which the digital matter is published. However, this would ultimately be a matter for the courts to determine. For the defence to apply, the defendant must prove the defendant had at the time of the publication, an accessible complaints mechanism for the plaintiff to use. An individual Facebook page may not have this.

However, the alleged defamed person B could notify the individual A through a private message that a third party post on individual A's Facebook page to defame them, putting them on notice to remove the material. It would be a matter for the courts to determine if the defence was applicable and established.

I hope that is of assistance to members both here and in another place in understanding the merits of the bill, the comprehensive nature of the bill, and the reason that the government is bringing this bill forward to progress these nationwide reforms, which we believe are of great merit.

In conclusion, I thank my department representatives Bruce Paterson and Isabella Comfort. Thank you very much for your support and, likewise, of course, Kristy Bourne and other members of the department and indeed my office. I really appreciate that support.

The briefings have been provided to other members of the parliament or other members of this Chamber. As I said earlier, if there are any further queries or questions on this or related matters, feel free to reach out to myself directly or my office. I am more than happy to assist honourable members.

Honourable Speaker, I commend the bill to the House.

Bill read the second time.


DEFAMATION AMENDMENT BILL 2024 (No. 42)

Third Reading

Bill read the third time.


ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (ALTERNATIVE VOTING PROCEDURES) BILL 2025 (No. 4)

Second Reading

Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Minister for Justice) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the bill be now read a second time.

This bill proposes amendments to the Electoral Act 2004 that will enhance Tasmanians access to voting at parliamentary elections. Importantly, these amendments will help ensure that the Tasmanian Electoral Commission (TEC) is able to provide alternative ways to vote, such as telephone voting, for use by electors who are facing accessibility barriers to voting at a polling place or by post. This includes Tasmanians with a print disability, namely people with vision impairment or blindness, physical dexterity difficulties, learning disability, brain injury, dementia, and those with literacy issues.

The advocacy work from disability advocacy organisations and people within the disability community has been instrumental in the development of this bill. Last year, I had the pleasure to meet with representatives from Blind Citizens Australia and Disability Voices Tasmania who, on behalf of a coalition of people with disability and disability advocates, raised the need for these amendments with the government. I thank them for their valuable input and insights. Feedback provided during community consultation that occurred in November and December 2024 was supportive of the legislative reform and informed several changes made to the consultation draft of the bill.

The need for these amendments arises because for Tasmanians with a print disability, voting at a polling place or by post can be very challenging and sometimes impossible. However, the Electoral Act 2004 currently limits the commission in its ability to provide alternative voting methods, such as telephone voting to electors who are unable to vote at a polling place due to reasons of geographical remoteness.

While section 113 of the Electoral Act 2004 does provide for the approval of procedures to assist electors who are unable to vote without assistance, this only applies to voting at polling places. The Electoral Commission has approved several procedures under this provision, including 'VI-Vote', a computerised system providing enhanced audio, visual and printing capabilities to enable independent voting for people with vision impairment or low vision.

The TEC currently provides a telephone voting service under approvals made under sections 131 and 132 of the act. However, only electors in Antarctica, a declared 'remote area', or outside Tasmania are eligible to vote under systems approved under these provisions.

In developing these amendments, the government has considered the approaches taken in other jurisdictions. All other states and territories allow for some form of electronically assisted voting reserved for use by specified categories of electors, in particular electors with a vision impairment. The approaches across jurisdiction vary considerably, both in terms of how a system is specified and who is entitled to use it.

The approach taken in the bill aligns with the TEC's functions and responsibilities under the Electoral Act 2004, which include approving a range of administrative forms and procedures within legislatively defined principles. In this way, our Electoral Act enables the TEC to be responsive and flexible in providing appropriate and contemporary electoral services for Tasmanian electors.

These amendments also preserve the functional independence of the commission, which is a crucial element of our democratic system.

I will now outline the bill's key reforms. The bill inserts a new Division 9A into the act. This division is based on Division 10 of Part 5 of the act, which enables the TEC to approve procedures to enable voting by electors in Antarctica, remote areas and outside Tasmania.

The bill enables the commission to approve alternative voting procedures where satisfied electors do not have reasonable opportunity to vote under other provisions of the act. This provision makes clear that the commission can approve procedures for classes of electors, for example those with a print disability. The amendments also provide the TEC with flexibility to adjust or expand a procedure or voting system as new needs are identified.

To help ensure the integrity of any proposed new system, the bill also specifies that before approving procedures, the TEC must be satisfied that any proposed system is practical and secure and can be appropriately resourced. Importantly, the procedures are, as far as practicable, to provide for the authentication of the vote and preserve the secrecy of the elector's vote.

It became evident during consultation that the bill would benefit from providing mechanisms to enable input from advocates and representatives from the disability community and others in the development of alternative voting procedures. The bill addresses this feedback in two ways.

First, the bill makes it clear that an accessibility and inclusion organisation may make a request to the commission regarding the need for alternative voting procedures. 'Accessibility and inclusion organisation' is defined as any organisation or peak body that focuses on advocacy, support or services for people with diverse needs, or any other group or body approved by the commission. The commission may also act on its own motion to approve alternative voting procedures, which covers all other circumstances that may arise.

Following on from this, under the proposed new section 130C the commission is to, where practicable, consult with appropriate accessibility and inclusion organisations in considering and making alternative voting procedures. In this way, the bill recognises the importance of input by disability advocates and other relevant stakeholders into the development of voting options that are designed for their use. Consultation is to occur as far as practicable to ensure the commission can be flexible and responsive, noting that at times an approval may be required as a matter of urgency.

The bill will enable the commission to approve procedures to ensure that votes cast under any alternative voting method are transmitted or forwarded securely for counting. These votes are to be counted with postal votes, which ensures consistency with processes applying to votes cast by electors in Antarctic remote areas, interstate and overseas.

The amendments could also help protect Tasmanians' access to voting in the event of an unexpected situation impacting regular voting services, such as a natural disaster. Additionally, they recognise that adjustments to an approval due to operational or technical constraints may sometimes be necessary to maintain the integrity of an electoral process.

I am pleased to note that the commission supports these changes and has indicated that, should the amendments be enacted, it anticipates a priority expansion of telephone voting services for electors with a print disability as an initial step in addressing their barriers to voting. 
The government is pleased to take this important step towards ensuring that Tasmanians with disability or who may face other accessibility barriers are able to exercise their democratic franchise. 

Honourable Speaker, I commend this bill to the House.

[6.48 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I am pleased to be able to indicate the opposition's support for the Electoral Amendment (Alternative Voting Procedures) Bill 2025. I will start my contribution where the Attorney-General finished his.

The importance of allowing people to 'exercise their democratic franchise' were the words he used, and that is vitally important. I recognise that this is significant law reform. It might look quite simple on its face, but it is vitally important.

Australia having compulsory voting is something that we should all be very grateful for, not only as elected representatives but as citizens of this country. Indeed, we are the envy of other democratic nations in having compulsory voting. As we can see around the world, there are very worrying and disturbing things occurring in other countries right now, particularly in the United States, much of which can be put down to a lack of compulsory voting in that country.

There are anecdotal stories that in the United Kingdom, where elections traditionally happen on a weekday - I cannot remember which weekday, whether a Tuesday or a Thursday, but not a Saturday as we have as our tradition in Australia - that conservative candidates are historically more likely to be elected if it was raining on the day the election was held. Presumably, we could guess that that might be put down to the fact that there is a greater chance that people who might vote progressive might not have access to their own cars and might be relying on public transport. Compulsory voting is something that we should be grateful for as a democratic country and indeed, others look to Australia as being very fortunate in that regard.

Part of the benefit of compulsory voting is that everybody who is eligible to vote is able to exercise that right. Nobody should be disenfranchised via disability, location or any other means from being able to exercise their democratic right to vote in state and federal elections, local government elections and any other election for which they are an eligible voter. 

For too long, people with varying disabilities and abilities have been prevented and indeed still are prevented, sadly, from being able to exercise their right to vote for a range of different reasons, many but not all of which are addressed in today's bill.

This bill will empower the Tasmanian Electoral Commission to approve alternative voting procedures to facilitate voting by voters who are experiencing barriers to accessing a traditional voting service - in other words, turning up at a polling booth on election day or doing a pre-poll vote or a postal vote. These changes will enable, but are not limited to, the approval of electronic voting methods such as telephone voting. We heard the Attorney-General say that there is telephone voting available for Tasmanian elections, but it is limited to people who are geographically outside of Tasmania. Antarctica is a declared remote area, and that has been more recently extended to people who are interstate. 

It makes sense to extend telephone voting to people who are inside Tasmania but for whom voting would be an impossibility without telephone voting being made available. However, it is important to note that it will not be limited to telephone voting. The Attorney-General did go to that in his speech. The priority first step and first expansion for the Tasmanian Electoral Commission will be to expand telephone voting services for electors with print disabilities and other disabilities that might prevent them from voting in other ways. However, it is intended and indeed hoped by disability advocates and by the opposition that that will not be where it stops - that there will be continued advancements to increasing people's ability to exercise their democratic vote of voting in elections.

I note and commend the community organisations who have lobbied for a long time for these changes. The minister named Disability Voices Tasmania and Blind Citizens Australia as organisations he met with recently. I commend those organisations for their continued advocacy, not just in this state but nationally, to expanding the ability for people with disabilities to vote and highlighting the various complexities that people face in being able to access their right to vote. 

I also commend both COTA (Council on the Ageing Tasmania) and Dementia Australia, who have been not only vocal in the needs for people with varying abilities to be able to vote but also made written submissions to consultation on this bill.

Those organisations made really valid contributions that highlight the need not only for voting procedures but also for every government decision to consider the needs of people with disability. When making a government decision, it is my view that if you consider the needs of people living with disabilities and include provision for people with disability, it is a win/win for everybody.

One of the things that jumped out at me in the submissions made by both Dementia Australia and Disability Voices Australia is the need for the commission to have an overarching lens on the accessibility of polling places to people with disability and others. It is a fantastic first step to expand telephone voting to people who have a print disability or for whom voting in person is not appropriate or possible, but it does need to be a first step that is followed by further steps that will consider the needs of people with other cognitive impairments or communication difficulties for whom telephone voting is not going to be appropriate, and indeed for whom voting in person or at a pre-poll station or by post may also not be appropriate. It is really important that the needs of those voters are considered in future reforms that the commission will consider after these changes pass the parliament.

I want to share with the House the way that both Disability Voices and COTA express that. They said:

There is a need to consider a stronger provision that requires the commission to proactively identify and implement mechanisms to enable categories of voters, for example, requiring the commission to locate polling booths in fully accessible venues, requiring the commission to be ready for the diversity of needs of electors, and training to ensure appropriate responsiveness where necessary because the mechanisms implemented are insufficient to meet a particular individual's needs.

Similarly, Dementia Australia called for accessible, dementia-friendly voting places. I recognise the logistical difficulties of hiring halls and making sure that polling booths are available. There is competition for space. I know that both the AEC (Australian Electoral Commission) and the TEC do what they can to make sure that there are sufficient wheelchair-accessible polling booths available on polling day, for example. However, the essence of what these two submissions tell us is something that I think is an important message not just for this bill but for all decisions of government: when the needs of people with disability are truly at the heart and the core of a decision that government makes, everybody wins.

For example, an accessible dementia-friendly voting place is not only going to be accessible by somebody with dementia or other cognitive impairments that might mean that a traditional voting experience is not suitable for them, but it is not going to do any harm to everybody else. If I can digress very briefly to refer to an example that I think is relevant to this broader discussion about the rights of people with disability, and that is looking at ADHD diagnosis and treatment across Tasmania. 

One of the things that members of Standing Committee B and I have heard from psychologists and individual members of the public who have presented to that committee is the need for classrooms in primary schools and high schools to be set up and designed in a way that caters to the needs of neurodivergent kids and students and learners. The benefit of that is that those children and learners will not need specific arrangements made for them because the classroom is going to be catering to their neurodivergent needs. The win/win in that situation is that no neurotypical child is going to be disadvantaged by a classroom that is set up to cater for the needs of neurodivergent learners.

With the indulgence of the House letting me digress into that ADHD example from the committee, I think it applies as well to this bill and to other decisions of government - that if the needs and the rights of people with disability are at the heart of a decision that is made, those people benefit and nobody is disadvantaged by that. 

I note that as a result of the community consultation, some changes were made to the bill, and one of those is the insertion of an overall objective. That was not in the draft consultation bill, but it was one of the suggestions made by Disability Voices Tasmania and COTA. I note that the bill now does contain an object at section 130A:

The object of this division is to ensure that electors of all abilities and needs are reasonably provided with the opportunity to vote at an election.

I think that is a perfectly reasonable objective and a very commendable objective, and it will encourage the commission to, as I said, take what they have indicated will be their priority first step, that is extending telephone voting more broadly than how it currently operates, but will encourage them to make further changes in the future that will further enfranchise people with all range of abilities to be able to exercise their democratic right and vote in elections in Tasmania.

I commend the Attorney-General for progressing this important law reform. It is very meaningful to Tasmanians who might have been significantly disenfranchised in the past and missed out on their opportunity to vote.

I am really pleased to be able to provide a contribution on behalf of the Labor opposition and to indicate our support, and to also indicate that we will be watching with great interest the changes that the Tasmanian Electoral Commission makes once they are empowered to do so through this bill, because we really want to see all people in Tasmania able to exercise their democratic right, and that is to exercise their right to vote when they are an eligible voter.

I will finish my comments by making note of one other point that was made through the community consultation, and that is the need for the parliament to be able to maintain oversight of the actions that increase accessibility for people to vote. I absolutely respect the independence of the Electoral Commission. Indeed, it is something that has come up in debates in my time here many times, particularly when we were talking about establishing committees to look at elections when we were discussing the bill to expand the house to 35 seats. Everybody in this place, I think, acknowledges and respects the independent work of the commission.

I also note that since that consultation and since this bill was in its draft form, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has been established. I imagine that there might be some ability for that joint standing committee, when they look at their review of state elections as a routine piece of work after each election, to be able to also take submissions and look at the accessibility of voting by people with varying abilities. 

I will finish by again thanking the Attorney-General, his office and his department for the briefing that I received on this bill, particularly Bruce, Felicity, Nicole, Katherine and Pete from the Attorney-General's office. Thank you very much for the information provided to me in the briefing and, again, this is a really significant first step that we are looking forward to seeing the Tasmanian government build on over time.

[7.03 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to speak on the Electoral Amendment (Alternative Voting Procedures) Bill 2025. I also extend my thanks to the Attorney-General and his department for the briefing at short notice. I really appreciated that. 

The Greens love democracy. One of our pillars is a commitment to grassroots democracy. I want to affirm the importance of democracy: the idea that everybody in our community should have a voice and a say in the decisions that are made on our behalf as a community.

As Ms Haddad, the member for Clark, was saying earlier, we only have to look around the world at the moment and see that democracy is under threat in many different places, particularly in the United States of America with the things that are happening there

In Australia, our democracy is precious and hopefully strong and stable. An important part of democracy is the right to vote. It is a core democratic right to be able to vote and to have a voice and to have a say. Accessibility ensures that all people have that right to vote and to have a say - that they are enabled, that they are included and that they are given a voice in decisions that we are making. We cannot make very good decisions if we are not listening to everybody, particularly the people who are affected.

The Greens support this bill because we appreciate that it will increase accessibility of voting and give flexibility to the Tasmanian Electoral Commission to be able to provide additional services that will enable more people in Tasmania to vote.

The situation in Tasmania has been difficult up until now. I wanted to read from a submission that was made by the Blind Citizens Australia (Tasmania Branch) and Disability Voices Tasmania in August last year to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The story of David and Carol was included in that submission, and I will read from it now because I believe it highlights the importance of this bill:

David has very little vision. His wife Carol uses a wheelchair that she cannot push herself. Carol's eyes, David's muscles. David and Carol went to their usual polling place a few hundred metres from home. It was closed. Not to worry, just jump in the car like most Tasmanians, drive to the nearest polling place and get on with the day. But neither David nor Carol are able to drive, and accessible taxis would turn a quick trip into a long afternoon with who knows what access to wheelchair-friendly toilets.

This would also have involved a $30 to $40 fare on a pension. All other polling places were wheelchair accessible with assistance. David would have to help Carol past unknown barriers in unfamiliar places where he could use his white cane as a visual aid if he could. 

So, David and Carol gave up and did not vote. David acknowledges he could have applied for a postal vote before polling day. This would have meant he had to fumble with the ballot papers and envelopes while holding a pencil in one hand and a magnifier in the other. Carol could have fumbled with the papers and tried to keep the pencil in her stroke-affected hands.

Here we have a story of people who were excluded and not able to vote in a recent election. I went back to the Tasmanian Electoral Commission's website to look at what was available in terms of access to voting for vision-impaired and assisted voting for people in the 2024 State Election. Before polling day there were three locations, one in Burnie, one in Hobart and one in Launceston, that were designated as vision-impaired and assisted voting sites. On election day, on the actual polling day on 23 March, there were three sites, Burnie, Hobart and Newnham in Launceston. Accessibility has been a significant issue in Tasmania for people wanting to vote and we believe that this amendment to the Electoral Act will go towards addressing that.

Section 4 of the bill states, 'The object of this division is to ensure that electors of all abilities and needs are reasonably provided with the opportunity to vote at an election'. That is a great objective to have and something we need in Tasmania.

The Greens also appreciate that this bill contains many opportunities for alternatives. It is not limited to just one way of doing things. People can raise issues about accessibility with the commission, and the commission may act. In clause 4 of the bill, 130C(2), it says:

(2)	The Commission may act under subsection (1) - 

on its own motion; or
on the request of an accessibility and inclusion organisation.

The Greens value that there are two different ways that alternative voting procedures can be raised. That is through the commission choosing to do it or through a request from others. That provides many opportunities for these issues to be addressed.

The following clause, 130C (3), says:

Before taking any action under subsection (1), the Commission is to, as far as is practicable, consult with any accessibility and inclusion organisation that the Commission considers necessary and appropriate.

I draw attention to that and highlight the importance of people with disabilities and accessibility needs being included and consulted along the way, and having a voice. They are not just having a voice in their vote, but also having a voice in the way alternative voting procedures are arranged for them.

Thank you for this bill. We definitely support it and look forward to all Tasmanians having the ability to exercise their democratic right, to vote and have a say in who represents them in government.

[7.10 p.m.]
Mr FERGUSON (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I thank the Attorney-General for bringing this bill to the House. This is an important bill: not the world's most significant bill for most people until they realise it is relevant to them. It will be the most important bill in their lives because of the improvement it brings forward. I appreciate what Ms Rosol shared. The absence of this legislation did make a difference for David and Carol being able to vote. I have a story to share as well, when I come to it.

Thank you to the Attorney-General for his work on this. I also commend, in particular, the disability advocacy organisations in our community that have been instrumental in the development of this bill. I understand that it was these advocates who came up with the problem and some of the solutions in a meeting with the Attorney-General and our hard working Minister for Disability Services, Jo Palmer. Both of these ministers have worked closely, which is really what you want to see from your government: ministers working closely with key stakeholder organisations, people who deeply understand their constituency and their concerns. Blind Citizens Australia and Disability Voices Tasmania, on behalf of a coalition of people with disability and advocates, raised their concerns with the Electoral Act, specifically regarding voting opportunities and the difficulty in accessing voting places.

Currently, the act enables the commission to approve alternative voting procedures in only two circumstances: first, under section 113, the commission can approve procedures that are reasonable and appropriate to assist electors at polling places - my emphasis - who are unable to vote without assistance; secondly, under sections 131 and 132, to approve procedures to enable electors, where practicable, to vote when they are interstate, overseas, or in remote locations like Antarctica. 

Let us just have a quick look at that. Often our thoughts tend to turn to people with blindness or vision impairment and that is worthy, but there are also more examples. We need to be trying to maintain the voting franchise as widely as possible. The Liberal Party has a proud tradition of widening the franchise to Tasmanians and Australians, to widen the franchise as widely as possible for people who are eligible and want to vote, and are, obviously, keen to do so.

By the way, what a treasure we have as Australians that this is an orderly act of our daily lives. Every three or four years we get to do that - a right denied to billions of other people on the globe. We need to make sure that not only do people have the vote, but they have access to their vote. By access in this case we mean being able to put that voting intention into effect. It is upsetting to me, as a Liberal member for Bass, that there have been examples of people with vision impairment who have not been able to enjoy the vote that I myself have been able to enjoy without difficulty in the past. Even the VI Vote terminals in that system are only available at very limited polling places. 

Good on the commission, by the way, for doing this, noting I also printed out that same list of polling places earlier. Before polling day, it was available in only three places in Tasmania: Burnie, Hobart and Launceston - three fine cities. However, let us remember that we are the most decentralised, regionalised state in the country. That suits residents of Burnie and surrounds, Launceston and surrounds, Hobart and surrounds. It is still a gap if you live in outer Launceston if you have to rely on a taxi or an Uber to get there, though. That is a financial barrier.

As the member for Bass, Ms Rosol, also described on polling day, those three polling places were in Burnie, Hobart and Newnham, in the northern suburbs. I found that interesting as well. Not even particularly central. Again, good on them for doing it, but that was their best effort under the act as it was available at the time, making sure that the adjustments they were doing were reasonable.

I think we are all turning our attention to ensuring that the same kind of access is reasonably provided to people who are not making it to vote. I am not only speaking here of people who are vision-impaired and blind. That is why I am particularly proud of the government for choosing to approach this without codifying in detail exactly how it shall work. It has taken a principles-based approach and gives a head of authority to the commission itself to be able to determine alternative voting procedures for cohorts of people who need it. For that reason, it is probably one of the most user-friendly acts of this parliament that we will be able to do in widening that franchise and allowing the commission to undertake its due diligence. What the bill is doing is inserting, amongst other things, that new division to allow the commission to approve alternative procedures that are reasonable and appropriate, to facilitate voting by electors who are experiencing barriers to accessing traditional voting services.

No mention of blindness, no mention of vision impaired. It is because it is taking a principles-based approach, which I applaud, I really do, because there are other Tasmanians who are experiencing similar barriers but not because of their vision. The approach that the Attorney-General and the minister have brought into this bill in the Cabinet puts in that new division, which aligns with existing Division 10, which allows that commission to approve voting procedures for electors who are in Antarctica, remote areas and out of the state.

I appreciate Ms Haddad, who is not with us right at the moment, but she pointed out that thanks to the people who contributed to the consultation, we do now have that object which has been included. That is great. Also a provision has been drafted to raise the need for alternative voting procedures and for the commission to proactively go and consult with stakeholder organisations regarding such possible procedures that may affect and benefit other groups of Tasmanians, and I think that is great.

I will note alternative votes are to be counted with and alongside postal votes. Obviously, these alternative votes are still committed to paper, a ballot paper which is rolled in with the postal vote count process that is providing consistency with the Division 10 requirements for votes cast under approved procedures by electors who are in those outside or remote areas. These votes are all then subject to that important rechecking and counting requirement in Division 12 of the Electoral Act, and I will return back to that point in a moment.

I am very pleased to note that the commission has advised the government that it supports these changes before us today, and it has indicated that should the amendments be enacted, as I hope they will, it anticipates a priority expansion of telephone voting services for electors with a print disability as an initial step in addressing their barriers to voting. Attorney-General, you might be good enough to, in your summing up, indicate just how soon that might actually come into place. Knowing that the commission is so on board that they are going to make this a priority group for expansion up front, I think, shows a lot of respect to our stakeholder organisations, those disability advocates who have themselves been so proactive. I acknowledge and appreciate the commission and the commissioner for saying so and I look forward to seeing it coming to fruition.

Briefly, I want to mention that there is an important process here. I had to educate myself on this and as we have all been candidates for election, perhaps some of us have at times been asked by people, 'How can I vote?', 'I am having a bit of a difficulty voting. Can you please tell me what I need to do here?'

To have a telephone vote, noting that you have to be in Antarctica, interstate or overseas to be able to access this particular service, the commission strongly advises people to, first of all, before they actually phone and initiate that process, think about your vote.

I am not vision impaired, so I have the benefit when I go to vote. I do not have to have studied the ballot and the number of candidates and their names before I get there, because I might be quite happy to do that when I am in the polling booth. When I am at the booth with my ballot, I can scan it with my eyes. I can read all of the names and think about it and I can take as long as I want.

People who are using the telephone service may not have that luxury. The commissioner is encouraging people to first of all, consider that vote in advance. I think that will be an important point for the communications plan on this, as this widens and more people start to use telephone voting to encourage them to have that thinking before they call. To then make the phone call, call the voting service during their particular hours - there is a particular number - and encourage the person to select the interstate or overseas elector option, 'have a pen and paper handy', it says. I think some of those instructions might need to be updated as well.

The phone voting registration team member will check if you are enrolled to vote and that you have not already voted. If you are eligible, they will ask you to write down your unique phone voting code. Attorney-General, I invite the commission again to consider those instructions for people who are blind or vision impaired.
Finally, to help maintain the secrecy of your vote - and this is really important for integrity - you will then be transferred to a separate phone voting team who will ask for your unique phone voting code and record your preferences on a ballot paper before they will place it in a secure ballot box. Let us just remember that as this is implemented practically and the communications to go with it, let us give care to people who may struggle to be able to write down a number and then be expected to be able to read it back to the operator. I am sure that can be worked through by our hardworking people at the commission. Thought will need to be given very carefully to that.

I have dealt with the fact that it is not prescriptive in the bill: it is principles based. I think that is brilliant. Thank you for the truthful story about David and Carol being excluded from being able to participate in their election. I have a different story. This is from my constituent, who I will call Iris. She sent me this message. Yes, she is a Liberal supporter and a very big Michael Ferguson supporter. I make that declaration. There are some out there. She sent me this message and it alarmed me at the time. The message read:

Vote is on Saturday and I am housebound. How am I going to get my vote done? I was too late to apply for postal. You never know, it might be the most important. I get good vibes from passers-by who read your sign. 

Good luck. Best of British luck.

The question I would not expect the Attorney-General to answer today, but I ask that the Attorney and the department and perhaps the commission give thought to this: will you please request the commission to take on board that feedback? To consider after we have looked after people with blindness and vision impairment that we give some concern to take in the next cohort, which I would submit should be considerate of special measures for elderly or otherwise frail Tasmanians who are housebound.

When Iris sent me that email, the first thing I did was suggest, 'Look, have you thought of a postal vote?' If you are housebound, the postal is not much good. You cannot exactly go and collect the mail and then take your postal ballot back to the nearest local post box. That involves leaving the house. It is no good if you are housebound.

In terms of access to a polling booth, thinking about frail, aged and/or housebound Tasmanians, when you think about it in terms of their access to a polling booth. They may as well be in Antarctica, interstate or overseas, because they simply cannot functionally get to that location.

I think we could agree that there are all sorts of reasons why that might be the case, whether they are social or just because of your permanent disability or even a temporary or medical reason for being disabled for a shorter period of time but it overlaps an election. I am asking the government to take that on board and I am sure that is a reasonable request.

In researching this subject - as I wind up - I happened upon a comment by a disability advocate in Canada by the name of David Lipofsky. He made this point. He said:

The essence of the voting system in a democracy is the secret ballot, and by that it means a person marks their own ballot in secret so that no one else knows who they're voting for. And at the same time, they can also check to make sure they mark their ballot paper the way they wanted to. And then they deposit the ballot in the box and there's no one who comes between you and the ballot.

He goes on.

People without disabilities take this right for granted …

Look, I found that quite confronting and I realised it was true of me. He said:

People without disabilities take this right for granted because they don't have to think about it. They go there, they're handed the ballot, they go into a little booth, they mark it themselves and then they drop it at the box. For blind people voting federally, we have not ever had that right.

He is, of course, referring to the Canadian system. He said:

We have to either have someone else mark our ballot for us, which means you have to tell someone else, say a trusted friend or a polling official, who you're voting for.

There goes the privacy of your vote. You then have to assume or trust that they mark the ballot the way you ask them to, because you cannot go back and check the ballot yourself in private to make sure that it was marked the way you wanted it to be marked. That does not just address concerns about someone who deliberately marks it wrong. It could be that somebody spoiled the ballot by accident. I found that really pertinent to this debate and I wanted to share it with the House.

First, the question of the individual Tasmanian's privacy and their right to a secret ballot. I am satisfied - I think all of us should be - that the telephone voting system is effectively a secret ballot, because the secondary personnel at the commission who are recording your conversation in your vote do not actually know who you are. They only have your code. That is tremendous. 

Second, we all need to be able to trust that the vote was faithfully recorded the way that the voter requested over the phone because they are placing trust in that system as well. We need to honour that trust. My second question to the Attorney-General is, if he would be good enough to either tell the House in the summing up or take it on notice, what integrity measures will be in place to ensure that the increased use of the telephone option - which we will see - to ensure that the telephone option is accurately recorded? I am aware that in that second stage part of the telephone conversation there are two people listening to that call - one recording, one watching. I ask again whether there could be consideration for some spot checks or audits by a person who would be able to ensure that the numbers coded onto the ballot paper, whether by hand with a pen or whether computerised and then printed out through a printer, whatever the method, that we can have complete satisfaction it is not open to abuse at all. 

As a member of the government party, I am very pleased to strongly support this important step toward ensuring that Tasmanians with disability or Tasmanians who face other accessibility barriers are able to exercise their democratic franchise. Well done Attorney-General and to the government.

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Deputy Speaker, in response to a question from Mr Andrew Jenner in relation to the proportion of workers on the Bridgewater bridge who are local Tasmanians, which was taken on notice by the Premier, I can advise as follows: in the month of February 2025, approximately 90 per cent of the project's total workforce of approximately 350 were Tasmanians. Over the life of the project, approximately 2400 people have worked on the project and approximately 80 per cent have been Tasmanian residents. 

In response to a question from Mr Bayley to minister Ogilvie in relation to stocking densities that apply to operations at the south of Zuidpool Rock marine farming lease, I can advise as follows: the maximum permissible stocking density of salmonid fish in relation to the volume of a pen is prescribed as a management control under the D'Entrecasteaux Channel and Huon River Marine Farming Development Plan. The plan states at 3.4.1 that the maximum permissible stocking density of salmonid fish is 25 kilograms per cubic metre of caged volume unless otherwise specified in the marine farming licence. This control is in place to ensure the welfare of the farm stock. The specified limit for this region has remained unchanged since it was established in the late 1990s.

I can further advise the House that the current marine farming licence for south of Zuidpool Rock does not vary from this stated limit.


Collins Street, Hobart - Bike Lane Trial

[7.32 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I rise today to talk about Collins Street in Hobart. Collins Street is a secondary road, running east to west. It is a popular walking and riding route. It has businesses, a cinema and book shops, and it is mooted as a bike lane trial project. The Hobart City Council website suggests that there have been 15 years of urban design planning for Hobart that have culminated in the proposal for the Collins Street bike lane trial and amenity upgrades. Much of this journey has been in conjunction with State Growth.

There was an announcement on 15 July of last year by the Transport minister, Mr Abetz, that the government, as part of the Better Active Transport in Greater Hobart, round 2 of grants, would be funding three projects in Hobart: the Castray Esplanade, Augusta Road, and a bike trial worth $170,000 for a trial of bike lanes and upgrades to the amenity of Collins Street. This was the second stage of funding. An amount of $30,000 had already been submitted and accepted as a grant by the City of Hobart to have the preliminary works done.

That was on 15 July 2024. Two days later - and this is through a Right to Information request that I put through - the Department of Premier and Cabinet received a letter from a partner of Font PR. This is Wednesday 7 July at 12.04 p.m. The subject is 'Questions for Minister Abetz re Collins Street Bike Lanes'. I paraphrase:

Hi, 

I saw late last week that Eric announced $170,000 in state government funding for this project, which seemed odd given his accompanying comments which hardly sounded supportive of the project. So, my questions are:

Did the minister personally approve this grant?

If so, why, given the clear controversy around the project?

What was the assessment process for the grant, that is, who assessed and what, if any consultation, did they undertake with potentially affected bodies such as Collins Street traders?

It then goes on to say:

No rush. Deadline 5.00 p.m. Friday, please.

That is two days later.

Sometime after the receipt of this email, a unilateral announcement by the Minister for Transport was made that the government would walk away from the promised funding of $170,000. Well done, lobby group Font PR. If that is how you get the minister to jump, well done. However, this unilateral decision was against the government's and the department's own advice, and this is over many years. I quote from advice from the department:

This project has been around for a while and identified in the Hobart City Deal plus in the Greater Hobart Cycling Plan. It is also well established in Tasmanian government endorsed plans, and this shows that Collins Street is part of Greater Hobart's principal cycling network.

It goes on to say:

The Inner Hobart Transport Network Operations Plan, page 12, shows this strategic road-user hierarchy for cycling.

It goes on. Clearly, the Collins Street Bike Lane Trial was an important part of expanding the bike network.

At 5.30 p.m. on 18 March, there will be a public meeting hosted by the City of Hobart at City Hall. It is about a possible elector poll in relation to this. It is really important for anybody who has concerns about how things are done by ministers, how decisions are made and how urban upgrades can occur. It is really important that people attend. The minister should not have made this unilateral decision and it should not have jumped to Font PR's demands.

Time expired.


Salmon Industry - Mass Mortality Crisis - Impact on Franklin Communities

[7.37 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, I rise after a long, hot summer weekend to speak on behalf of many of the people in my community of Franklin and other people who visited over the weekend with the hope that they would enjoy the beautiful, clear, sparkling waters of the Huon and channel rivers. I want to speak on behalf of all the communities who are affected by what they have seen over the last month and what they saw when they tried to go to the beach on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday.

What they saw were stinking, rank globules of fish fat lining the shores of the beaches they went to, an oily sludge on top of the water in some areas, and soupy, murky, lifeless waters in the sea when people went into them. It was a very shocking and deeply outraging experience for many people. Others have talked about being depressed at where things have got to.

The beaches affected were Verona Sands, Charlotte Cove, Randalls Bay, Ninepin Marine Reserve, Mickeys Beach, Drip Beach, Gourlays Beach and Surveyors Bay - which I hear from people that there is evidence that that beach was swept three times over the weekend by Huon Aquaculture staff to get rid of the fish chunks and residue on that beach - Garden Island, Huon Island, Kay's Beach, Eggs and Bacon Bay, Abels Bay, Roaring Beach, Conleys Beach on Bruny Island. This was the tip of the iceberg when you consider the remote coves, the bays and the headlands, let alone what is in the water column that is out of our vision. The communities that were affected were Cygnet, Lymington, Garden Island Creek, Randalls Bay, Bruny Island, Verona Sands, Gordon, Surveyors Bay, just to mention a few.

People felt deep anxiety about going to the beach. It was a real fear that people had - for their pets, for their children and for themselves - because of the mixed messages and the lack of action that they have had from the government. There were mixed messages about the impact of the diseased fish on their health; there was a failure of the government to take any real actions, especially to provide them with information about going into the water. People have fear for the futures of the areas that they have invested their lives into and great outrage at the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) and the government for, in the last couple of weeks, parroting industry talking points.

There is a determination amongst themselves to make decision-makers listen - for this event not to be the one that people turn away from, but actually look and understand that this is something which has happened because of the failure of this Liberal government to regulate, to hold the industry to account and to prevent these sorts of marine devastations occurring.

Communities are coming together, from the Tasman Peninsula to Carlton, Cygnet and Dover. I want to give a shout-out especially to the locals and the community campaigners who have done the work to bring this evidence to the public attention. If it was not for them, if it was not for the Bob Brown Foundation taking that drone footage over fish farm pens, we would not have seen the images of the extreme cruelty of taking live fish and putting them in with dead fish into a container, putting the lid on top and suffocating them.

That is the sort of stuff that is happening. It is only because of campaigners doing this work that we have seen the dead, rotting fish, that we have seen the globules of fish fat and chunks of dead, diseased salmon on beaches. Thank you to them. Thank you to the neighbours of fish farms for their work.

Of course, what has happened, the failure to manage our marine environment and the expansion of fish farms, their push of the global foreign-owned corporations trying to go further into Storm Bay has meant that new communities in Carlton River and Dodges Ferry, South Arm, the Friends of the Bay, have developed in response.

People demand action and we are supporting them, demanding that we get fish out of these inshore areas and get them onto land. We need an inquiry into this issue and we need to understand the failures, we need to hold the industry to account and we need to hold this Liberal government to account for failing to regulate and allowing this crisis to occur in the first place.


Mother-Baby Unit in Southern Tasmania - Response to Labor Party Comments

[7.42 p.m.]
Mrs PETRUSMA (Franklin - Minister for Health) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to address claims made by the Labor Party today in relation to the new mother and baby unit which will be located at St John's Park. Our number one priority ever since the announcement by Healthscope is ensuring that mothers and babies have the appropriate support and services that they need during and following their birthing journeys. As part of this, a new intensive residential parenting unit will be established at St Johns Park in New Town to support mothers experiencing post-natal challenges in southern Tasmania including support for their mental and their physical health needs.

With regard to what services are best placed here, we will be listening to the experts on what services are needed and we will ensure that what is provided at the new unit will support mothers experiencing postnatal challenges, including being focused on residential, psychosocial and intensive parenting support. This includes a multidisciplinary team to provide assistance with issues such as parental anxiety and depression, as I explained this morning, feeding, settling, sleeping, family attachment and behavioural issues.

This contemporary model of care will be developed with stakeholders from across the health system, recognising that a home like community environment, rather than a hospital environment, is a more appropriate setting for delivering care to the majority of patients in this cohort. The new unit will act as an extension of existing statewide parenting services provided by the department's Child Health and Parenting Services, or CHaPS, and in partnership with Tresillian Family Care in Launceston.

While staffing needs are not finalised because, as I have explained on a number of occasions, we are still developing the model in conjunction with experts, the existing Royal Hobart Hospital mother baby unit staff, including those who initially transferred from St Helens Private Hospital, will be offered the opportunity to work in the new intensive Residential Parenting Unit, once operational.

The staffing mix for a residential service typically includes midwives, allied health professionals, child health nurses and mental health professionals with support from the Tasmanian Health Service (THS) medical specialist to meet the needs of the individual clients or consumers.

I also assure the House that mothers and babies will be assessed to ensure they receive the most appropriate care in the right place. Where severe and acute mental health concerns are identified, including where our baby's safety may be at risk, mothers may be referred to the Royal Hobart Hospital Mental Health Inpatient Unit without their baby, in line with the current best practice. This decision will be made by clinicians with the safety of both the mother and their baby at the forefront.

I want to lastly add that the design principles for both residential units are to create a domestic scale and feel within an inpatient centre. An example of how this is achieved is the Peacock Centre, which is also designed along these principles. 


Maternity Services in Southern Tasmania

[7.45 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise this evening to speak on the situation of maternity services in southern Tasmania. Maternity services at the Royal Hobart Hospital are under pressure. The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (ANMF) has reported for years that staffing levels are a problem and last year they clearly called out how unsafe the staffing was for mothers and babies. In January, the independent investigation into maternity services found the number of permanent staff does not come close to the required full-time equivalent (FTE) for the unit.

Unions have long called for staffing models that reflect the work of caring for mothers and babies. The model currently used does not factor in the demands on midwives when caring for mothers and babies and in addition to that, in January the independent investigation into maternity services found staff do not know how to use the model and there is confusion about how it should be applied. Therefore it is not doing what it needs to ensure sufficient staff on the ward.
That is the current situation. Public maternity services are already overwhelmed and now, in addition to that, we have the announcement from Hobart Private Hospital that they will no longer provide maternity services from 20 August. This is a disaster. The Hobart Private Hospital provided vital maternity care, delivering 600 babies a year. This is a significant number of births in the context of 2000 births a year at the Royal. Moving those deliveries from Hobart Private Hospital to other services will result in added strain on an already fragile system, risking the safety of parents, babies and staff by increasing the likelihood of injury, complications and, hopefully it never happens, but a worst case scenario, even death. 

The abrupt closure of these essential services at Hobart Private at such short notice leaves expectant families unsure what this means for them and where they will find alternative care options. This causes significant stress and uncertainty at what can already be a stressful, anxious time when parents are particularly needing continuity of care as they prepare for birth. The Tasmanian Greens call on the Liberal government to reassure Tasmanians as to how the remaining maternity services will be supported to cope with this increasing demand. 

We note that since the Hobart Private Hospital announcement, the federal government has announced $6 million in funding for infrastructure and equipment at the Royal Hobart Hospital and Calvary Hospitals, and the state government has outlined how this money will be used and where it will go. This funding is welcome, but it does not address all the issues here, including an over-reliance on private health services. We understand that world choice is important and private hospitals provide for that choice. We need to ensure that public services are sufficient to meet the needs of Tasmanians.

The other issue is the staffing issue, and it is important to put this whole situation in context of this other issue. The ANMF have long been calling for staffing to be addressed within maternity services. The Rockliff government has not been doing enough to attract midwives to Tasmanian hospitals. We understand. We have had people contacting our officers, explaining that they have been trying to apply for jobs within the health system and there have been recruitment blockages to them. The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (ANMF) have also confirmed that this has been an issue.

The other thing that is happening at the moment is that there have been announcements of staff cuts - and you can call them natural attrition, you can call them hiring freeze on non-essential jobs, but what this means is that the Health Department is in a situation where it is trying to reduce costs and find ways to reduce staff to save money. This is really concerning in a context where we know that we already have a health service and a maternity service that is under pressure.

The Greens are calling on the government to take action to do the work to recruit more midwives. We understand that, with the shifts and changes in the Hobart Private Hospital closing, that there may be some opportunities there to recruit staff, but we would encourage the Health Department and the government to be looking at ways to offer midwives a market allowance that attracts more staff and retains midwives.

This is something that the ANMF have been calling for, for a number of years: a market allowance for midwives to help boost the staffing numbers within the maternity service. We encourage and call on the government to do what they can to ensure that midwives feel valued, that there are enough midwives on the ward and that there is a safe service there for the people of Tasmania.
Frank MacDonald Memorial Prize

[7.50 p.m.]
Mr FAIRS (Bass) - Honourable speaker, I am deeply privileged to be this year's parliamentary representative for the Frank MacDonald Memorial Prize, which aims to educate Tasmanian students about our state's rich military history while making sure that understanding and remembrance of World War 1 is passed on to new generations.

The prize, named after Tasmania's last World War 1 veteran, sees six year nine students from around the state take part in a 10-day study tour of significant military sites in both Belgium and France. I cannot yet imagine what it would be like to hear The Last Post echo across the now peaceful countryside of the Australian National Memorial, as well as Villers-Bretonneux in France on Anzac Day.

The memorial honours forever the almost 11,000 of our countrymen missing in France from World War I, among the 45,000 Australians who lost their lives fighting on the Western Front. 

One of the requirements for participants on the tour is to research a Tasmanian soldier who fought in World War I and present their findings to the group. It did not take long to find a genuine unsung hero in James Ernest Carter, service number 2891. Private Carter was born in Launceston on 10 October 1887 and was employed as a railway porter. He was 5 feet, 4-1/2 inches tall and weighed in at 146 lbs - about 66 kilos. He was described by his mates as 'a stocky Charlie Chaplin'. Enlisting in the 12th Battalion on 22 July 1915 at the age of 27, the unmarried James Carter was eventually transferred to the 52nd Battalion and sent to the Western Front in 1916. According to his official war record, James was part of a group of 13 men of the 52nd Battalion who were all recommended for a bravery award for the following deed.

On 14 August 1916, some wounded men, having been left out in the front of the firing line near the Farm de Mouquet, a party volunteered to go out from base camp, a distance of 8 km, to try to bring them in. This they did, having to make their way over ground that was being heavily shelled by the enemy, with much trouble in the darkness. They did locate the men in no-man's-land near the enemy trenches and brought them back to safety over ground that was being swept by our own guns, and over the ground being bombarded by the enemy.

Private James Carter never returned from that recovery mission and his body was never found. It was this contemporary note sent to his sister back in Launceston by a fellow soldier that told the real story:

Enough cannot be said for poor Jim Carter for, although he was wounded in four places, he still fought on gamely during the retirement. Fritz was spraying us with his machine guns, so Jim and one or two others got down in a big shell hole. Jim said he was getting very weak and would push on, so he hopped over the top and the German machine guns took their toll. Jim did not move after. The boys who were with him nearly cried when they were telling me how he had fought and died. They said he was game and fought hard even after he was wounded four times. 

The unassuming Jim Carter, wounded in four places, went over the top to draw the German fire away from his mates, who made it back to safety as a result. I am not sure what makes a war hero, but that will do me.

There is another tragic twist of the story of Private James Ernest Carter. Back in Launceston, his married sister, an official next-of-kin, Grace Mickleborough, was advised her brother had been wounded and was in hospital, with no further word. Desperately worried, she wrote many letters to the Australian Imperial Force over six months requesting details of his wounds and which hospital Jim might be in, but there was scant information on his whereabouts. It took a court of inquiry the following year to confirm that Private JE Carter had indeed been killed in action on 4 September 1916 at Mouquet Farm in France.

The heroic story of James Ernest Carter moved me and my staff so much we attempted to research and contact any living relatives. Dianne Mickleborough, Jim's great niece, still lives in Launceston and had the one thing we did not already have - a photo of Jim Carter. I sincerely thank Dianne, who had no idea that her great uncle Jim was a war hero, the bravest of us, who sacrificed his life to save his mates. 

Private James Ernest Carter is one of those 11,000 Aussies whose bodies were never recovered from the fields of the Western Front. While in France, I will lay a wreath at the small memorial to our fallen diggers at Mouquet Farm, where he died a hero more than a century ago. I will also visit his memorial plaque at Villers-Bretonneux to pay my deep respects to this fine but unknown Tasmanian war hero. 

Wherever he lay, may he rest in peace.

Members - Hear, hear.


Native Ducks - Hunting Season

[7.55 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about the annual slaughter of native ducks. Other states have moved to ban it: Western Australia, New South Wales, ACT, and Queensland. However, in Tassie, the clean, green and clever state with a brand and identity absolutely anchored to environmental protection and wonder, we shoot them. Go figure. 

Some, like Western Australia and New South Wales, ended duck hunting back in the 1990s, 35 years ago. Here, the annual three-month season opened on the weekend. Over the next three months, Tasmania's 1000 or so licensed duck shooters will likely report taking over 35,000 ducks. I say 'likely report' because we know some shooters either do not report or under-report. In 2023 - the latest available reporting data - 35,716 ducks were shot by 1044 licensed hunters. In 2018, 1161 hunters took over 45,000 ducks. These are beautiful native species: Pacific black duck, chestnut teal, grey teal, wood duck, and mountain duck - the spectacular Australian shelduck. 

Apart from the unreported kills, what this data does not show are the wildlife deaths caused by wounding, orphanage or misidentification. Duck hunting is cruel. Hunting is only allowed by a shotgun, by its very nature an indiscriminate, unfocused way to kill. Whether a single duck on the wing or a flock, a shotgun sends dozens of individual shot in an ever-expanding, less concentrated circle. The greater the distance, the bigger the circle, the less concentrated and less targeted with less velocity the shot. What that means is that many - no one really knows how many - ducks are hit by a piece of shot but do not immediately die, are never recovered and, thus, never reported. Those animals fly on or fall, lost to succumb to their injury, infection, starvation or drowning. Some hunters use dogs to swim out and retrieve floating ducks, whether alive or dead. Imagine the terror when a living but injured duck is confronted with the jaws of a retriever, swum a distance back to the shooter then dispatched with a snap of the neck. These are sentient beings.

Because of the timing of the duck season, some animals are orphaned, as ducklings have not fledged and are yet to be able to fend for themselves. This point is highlighted in the current edition of Game Tracks, the department's handbook on all things hunting in Tasmania. It says:

Dispatch of wounded ducks. Duck hunters are reminded that when hunting they must ensure that any wounded ducks and dependent young that are unlikely to survive in the wild are humanely killed as soon as possible. It is always better to avoid shooting ducks that you suspect have dependent young.

Surely, it is even better to schedule the season well after the breeding season so ducklings do not become orphaned. Our view is that it should be banned completely, but if you cannot do that, at the very least time it so that ducklings do not die a horrible, orphaned death.

Then there is the non-target species illegally shot because of misidentification or deliberate disregard. In Tasmania, those five species of duck can be legally slaughtered. The balance is notionally protected, as are every other species of waterbird: the swans, grebes, herons and hens, but it is well understood and at times proven that non-target species die in the sights of duck hunters, sometimes for the jollies, and sometimes just unfortunate victims of mistaken identity. 

Where can you hunt ducks in Tasmania? Perhaps this is a strong cultural tradition that happens just on private land? Well, no. The 1000 licensed hunters represent less than 0.2 per cent of the Tasmanian population. Hardly an important cultural activity. With proper permission, they have access to public land, including some Hydro land and formal protected areas. Hydro allows duck hunting on six water bodies. Parks and Wildlife allows duck hunting on formal reserves, unbelievably part of the 50 per cent of Tasmania that the government and our state's PR lauds as protected. This includes Moulting Lagoon Game Reserve, Waterhouse Conservation Area, and Cameron Regional Reserve, amongst others.  

Duck hunting is a cruel, antiquated and completely unnecessary activity that has no place in 21st century Tasmania. As the climate dries, including on the mainland, Tasmania becomes an increasingly important haven for waterbirds where they should have the opportunity to migrate and breed free from the horror of duck hunting. With bird flu wreaking havoc amongst bird species around the globe, including waterfowl, the already compelling case against duck hunting becomes even stronger.

I acknowledge the tireless work of advocates and activists working to protect ducks from hunting, including Chris at Animals Tasmania, Peter at the Tasmanian Conservation Trust, Dr Eric Woehler, and Jim Collier. The RSPCA can also play a really important role.
Like other states, and echoed with the recent parliamentary recommendations in Victoria, duck hunting will become a thing of the past in Tasmania. For the sake of our species and reputation, may it be sooner rather than later.

Time expired.

The House adjourned at 8.02 p.m.

The Speaker, Ms O'Byrne, took the Chair at 10.00 a.m., acknowledged the Traditional People, and read Prayers.


MESSAGE FROM THE GOVERNOR

Division of Lyons - Election of Casey Farrell

The SPEAKER - Honourable members, I wish to advise the House of the following communication I have received from Her Excellency the Governor.

Dear Speaker,

I send herewith with a Certificate of the Electoral Commissioner stating that a recount has been held under the provisions of Part 9 of the Electoral Act 2004 to fill the vacancy in the Division of Lyons caused by the resignation of Ms Rebecca White MP.

Following the recount of the resigned member's ballot papers, Casey Farrell has been elected to fill the vacancy. The election takes effect from today.

Yours sincerely,

Barbara Baker
Governor


MEMBER SWORN

Casey Farrell - Member for Lyons

Casey Farrell, Member for the Division of Lyons, was sworn and declared that he had subscribed to the Code of Conduct.


STATEMENT BY SPEAKER

Code of Conduct

The SPEAKER - Before calling Question Time, I will raise two things. One, the new member has read and affirmed his obligations of the Code of Conduct. I remind you all to familiarise yourself with the Code of Conduct. It will be an issue that we may have to discuss again soon.


RECOGNITION OF VISITORS

The SPEAKER - Honourable members, secondly, I welcome into the gallery the second group of year 11/12 legal studies students from Hobart College who are here today. They are looking forward to you all being tremendously quiet and respectful and well-behaved, and will be scoring you appropriately.

Members - Hear, hear.


LEAVE OF ABSENCE

Minister for Infrastructure - Mr Vincent MLC

[10.04 a.m.]
Mr ROCKLIFF - Honourable Speaker, I advise that minister Vincent is absent from Question Time today. I will take questions in relation to his portfolio.


QUESTIONS

Economic Management - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.04 a.m.]
You have finally admitted you have trashed Tasmania's finances, yet instead of taking responsibility for fixing this problem, you want Tasmanians to bail you out and you are selling off our most valuable assets. Why should Tasmanians suffer higher power prices, increased car registrations and more expensive bus fares just because you have blown our budget? Why should we pay for your mismanagement?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. First, I welcome Mr Farrell to the House and look forward to his first speech in the coming weeks. Congratulations on your election.

What we have is a plan for Tasmania's future. What we have over there is a scare campaign or a plan for higher taxes. Higher taxes is the Labor way. We have a plan for Tasmania's future. You have a scare campaign and higher taxes, as is always the Labor way. 

What I can guarantee -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We outlined yesterday, as a result of the very challenging circumstances that we have found ourselves in, we invested to keep people well and in work. Governments across the globe and across Australia are now confronted with the challenges of sustainable budgets moving forward. What we outlined yesterday as a team was backing a strong economy and backing in business to grow the economy and support jobs. I am very proud of the fact that when I see a tradesman's ute driving to work, to a building site, I think to myself that there is another house going up. There is more infrastructure, whether that be a new school at Brighton or at Legana, or whether that be upgrades to the Mersey Hospital. I love seeing the tradesmen's utes on building sites and I want to keep them there to make sure we can grow our economy and support Tasmanians. 

We want to support business by cutting red tape as we will by ensuring we have - investing in quality services for the future. I am proud of the fact that our government has invested wisely into frontline services, health, our schools and community safety. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. It is a long Question Time to go. Members, you may want to hang out for it.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The evidence is clearly there. I know Labor's plan is to tax.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. Interjecting as he sits down will not be an appropriate behaviour, Ms Haddad. 


Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.08 a.m.]
You have a plan to sell Tasmania's future. Motor Accidents Insurance Board (MAIB) and TasNetworks are set to provide nearly half a billion dollars of dividends to Tasmanians over the budget and the forward Estimates. That is money that will help pay for our schools, hospitals and public infrastructure every single year. Where will you find the money for schools, hospitals and infrastructure every year after you have privatised our assets that are helping to pay for them? 

ANSWER

I will not be taxing Tasmanians like you. Here we are in a cost-of-living crisis where this government has reached in and supported Tasmanians -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, shadow treasurer.

Mr ROCKLIFF - through that global and national crisis by crediting power bills in terms of the renewable energy dividend and halving bus fares, making the cost of living easier for Tasmanians. What we will not be doing is taxing Tasmanians in a cost-of-living crisis like Labor. We will not be doing that. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order and listen to the answer. This is a significantly important issue for the Tasmanian people and we all deserve to hear the Premier's answer. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - I appreciate that, honourable Speaker, because as we go about very diligently in a sensible and methodical way, as you would expect us to do, which government owned businesses do we keep and which government businesses can we sell and invest into a future fund -

Mr Winter - Pay off the debt, mate. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Yes, to pay down debt. 

The SPEAKER - Premier, it does not help when you respond to them.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Yes, to offset our debt. It is a very sensible and prudent way to manage Tasmania's future. Not taxing like Labor. We are still feeling the effects of -

A member - That is just rubbish. What tax?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Well, that is up to you to outline -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The House will come to order. 

Premier, you will cease to seek interjections from the opposition, and the opposition will cease to bite to them. I am drawing you to the actual question. You have 46 seconds left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - If you do not have a plan and if you are not going to back our plan, you are going to tax Tasmanians. That is clear because you come in here every single day and talk about debt, but you have no plan to fix it. What we do not remind you enough of, because we remind you of your fix in 2011 where you sacked nurses and put hospital beds in storage. Do you remember that? 

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - The Premier mentioned in his answer that he would use the money generated from the sale of Tasmanian publicly owned assets to pay down debt. Yet, in his speech yesterday, he said he would use that money in a future fund. Which is it? Is he funding a future fund or is he paying down debt?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, minister Ellis does not need to help the Premier answer the supplementary question. Mr Abetz also does not need to help the Premier. He is fine on his own.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Investing in a future fund to offset debt, very clearly. Can I say, I am proud of our team's efforts yesterday in the state of the state. If I just quote from the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI) -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on both sides are now going to be quiet, thank you.

Mr ROCKLIFF - that Tasmania deserves nothing less than a government with an ambitious reform agenda. That is exactly what we saw yesterday. This is without doubt the most ambitious reform-orientated state of the state speech in over 20 years. Locking up windfalls into a sovereign wealth fund is the best way to ensure the proceeds are used to repair the budget first and foremost.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.


Government Business Enterprises – Proposal for Privatisation

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.14 a.m.]
At the last state election, the government you led was smashed into minority by the people of Tasmania. Yesterday, in your state of the state address, you confirmed a fire sale of Tasmania's public assets to fill the enormous budget black hole your government created, no doubt to help fund a billion dollar stadium that you did not mention once. For this you have no mandate: there has been no conversation with Tasmanians who own our Government Business Enterprises (GBEs) to sell off what generations of people have built up and funded. Your 2030 strong plan makes no mention of cutting the public sector or privatising assets and services. 

Is it arrogance or pressure from hard right colleagues that makes you think you have a mandate to sell off TasNetworks, MAIB, the Public Trustee or Metro? A year after you were elected in minority, what makes you think you have any sort of mandate for this huge privatisation agenda?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I reject the premise of the question first and foremost. We have made a very clear decision not to sell Hydro, the sacred cow, for very good reasons. Why would we not very sensibly have a look at our GBEs to ensure that they are delivering the services that benefit Tasmania? Why would we not do that?

This is about delivering better services for the Tasmanian people, but also should asset sales proceed, we will invest in a future fund. That is a sensible, forward-looking plan for Tasmania's future, where we can ensure that we have a sustainable budget moving forward to invest in those key areas that Tasmanians care about: teachers in our schools, health workers, nurses in our hospitals, and police on the streets to ensure community safety. That is what sustainable budgets are about, and that is what growing an economy is about. 

That is why the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and business leaders welcomed the forward-looking plan yesterday. It was not a taxing Labor plan. It was a sensible pathway to surplus where we can balance and manage the budget to ensure that we can invest in those key areas of service delivery.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. No member of the opposition asked this question. The Leader of the Greens has the right to hear the answer. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - The Labor way and the Labor-Greens way is to cut services and raise taxes.

Dr WOODRUFF - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance.

The SPEAKER - I am absolutely hearing the point of order, yes.

Dr WOODRUFF - The Premier has not gone anywhere near the question which is: what mandate do you have to make these vicious cuts and to privatise our assets? It is not in your plan. It was not talked about at the election. 

The SPEAKER - The Leader of the Greens cannot argue the point. I agree that the Premier can now turn his mind to addressing the question that was asked. Otherwise, there will be a supplementary and he will have to do it then, anyway.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It is important to remind Tasmanians that when you lot raided the superannuation provision account - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The Premier will address his remarks through the Chair.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It is now costing Tasmanians $400 million a year.

Dr Woodruff - You are selling their buses.

The SPEAKER - The leader will stop interrupting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - That is your economic management that trashed the budget.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, minister Ellis, minister Abetz, and members on my left.

Dr Broad - Do you believe that is how it works?
Mr ROCKLIFF - I know how you work. That is higher taxes. Your opportunity is to outline your plan today.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Before I call on what I imagine will be the supplementary, I remind members that this kind of behaviour is not going to be accepted. I have a number of tools, one of which is actually to walk out of here and you can sit and wait until I feel like coming back. If we want to get through Question Time, these are very serious issues that you are asking about today. The people deserve to be able to have their answers heard in silence. 

Supplementary Question

The SPEAKER - I will call the Leader of the Greens on a supplementary question request.

Dr WOODRUFF - It was the question that I asked, which was for the Premier to address a mandate. He made no mention of private sector cuts or privatisation in the 2030 Strong Plan. My question is: you do not have a mandate from the Tasmanian people - are you getting your mandate from Eric Abetz?

The SPEAKER - I will call the Premier to the question as it was the original question asked and according to my notes, was not addressed in the answer.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I will take your lead, honourable Speaker.

The SPEAKER - You will direct all of your responses to this issue through the Chair, Premier.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I will take your lead, honourable Speaker. You have highlighted this is a very serious issue, and the issues that we are talking about. I take Tasmania's future seriously. Any silly comments - like you have just said at the end of your so-called question - are beneath this parliament. We have the responsibility to govern now and for the future. That lot did not have the guts to form government. We knew of all the challenges globally and so we chose to step up. What I outlined yesterday was a very sensible pathway -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the supplementary question has expired.

Mr Willie - You went to an early election and delivered this path.

The SPEAKER - Mr Willie will find himself warned if I have my attention drawn to him again.


Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr O'BYRNE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.20 a.m.] 
Your state of the state speech yesterday included the bombshell announcement that the government would consider selling assets, including the Motor Accidents Insurance Board (MAIB) and Metro Tasmania, and leasing TasNetworks. In loungerooms and around kitchen tables last night, thousands of families were suddenly facing an uncertain future. The company they work for and the services they deliver are all under a cloud. This uncertainty will have a profound impact on their lives, including their career options, whether they can borrow money to buy a home or, indeed, whether they should stay in Tasmania. 

I have heard of business leaders and economists all being consulted about these proposed reforms, but what about those workers and their families? The people who drive our buses, keep the electricity grid running - are they going to be included in the conversation about the future?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. The answer to your question is yes. Of course, we will be engaging with the community and people who are most likely to be impacted. I am very mindful of that and very mindful of the need to ensure that our focus is actually on service delivery. That is why we are taking a look, sensibly working through in a very measured way, given the circumstances that we find ourselves in at this present time and the need to invest for the future. Service level guarantees, when it comes to those front-facing services such as the MAIB are very important. The conversation with the community will absolutely be involved.

The member speaks of mandate. We clearly outlined in our fiscal strategy that we would ensure that we needed not only to have the right-sized public service, but also ensure that we have a sustainable budget moving forward for the future. The ultimate arbiter of any decision about asset sales that may or may not be made will be this parliament. Democracy at work.

Mr Willie - You will lose your bottle again, will you not?

The SPEAKER - I can hear you, Mr Willie.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I wish the Labor opposition would take this more seriously than silly interjections such as that. We all need to work together to support a plan moving forward that is sustainable, where we have business and jobs growth in our state, where we support a sensible pathway to surplus, where we cut red tape and allow business growth and job creation, where we have the right-sized public service that we can afford - for 570,000 people - delivering the services that Tasmanians care about, but also investing for the future, following a good consultative process.

Thank you, Mr O'Byrne. Decisions will be made and presented to parliament on assets that can be kept and supported because they are delivering, and assets that we can invest into a future fund, for example.

Supplementary Question

Mr O'BYRNE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr O'BYRNE - Those are great words and commitments, but could the Premier outline how the workers will be consulted?

The SPEAKER - I will draw the Premier to the question. It arrives from an answer given to the original question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - There will be great interest from people who represent workers. Unions, for example, will have a clear plan for sitting down with people who need to be represented in this sensible and measured conversation.

Dr Woodruff - They were out on the streets this morning.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Yes, and I want to embrace sensible conversation in a measured way, given the challenges that we face and the need for a plan for the future. What I do not want - which I am not sure I am going to get - is a scare campaign.

Dr Woodruff - We will always speak the truth.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You will scare people and you will scare people, but at the end of the day, the challenges remain.

The SPEAKER - Premier, when you direct your answers directly to them, the interjections increase. I would much prefer you put all your answers through me as the Standing Orders require. 


Metro Services - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.25 a.m.]
Hundreds of weekly Metro services have been cancelled since 2023. Your rationale for selling Metro seems to be that you cannot figure out how to run a bus service. Will your plan to privatise Metro cause more cuts to services and higher fares for passengers? Why should Tasmanians pay for your budget mismanagement with their bus services that get them to work, to school or to the community services they desperately need?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - It is a wonderful chorus you have behind you wanting to answer questions for you, Premier, but I am sure you can do it without their assistance.


ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his questions. I want better services.  Working through what we outlined yesterday may well, I expect, lead to better services. No decision has been made apart from not selling the Hydro, so why would we not -

Mr Winter - Everything else is for sale.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Well, your plan was to gut the Hydro.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on both sides.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Big announcement. There it was. Twenty-four hours later it was gone out the door.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my right.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I am still chuckling about it because it was, frankly, the most embarrassing thing I have seen from an opposition ever.

Your plan was to gut Hydro. We have kept it. Actually, we have supported its focus to be about Tasmania and Tasmanians. We are very proud of the fact that we have been able to reach in and support a renewable energy dividend at the same time. Thank you to our forebears who built through blood, sweat, and tears that renewable energy scheme.

To your point, what we outlined yesterday was a plan for the future, not a scare campaign -

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - What the Labor Party is about are scare campaigns and higher taxes. We have a plan for the future. We have a plan for the future cutting red tape -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Franklin, Leader of the Greens and members on my right.

Mr ROCKLIFF - a focused and right-sized State Service and investing in the future fund for future generations of Tasmanians.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - Can I have a supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.
Ms Brown - How dare you?

The SPEAKER - Order. Can I just stop the supplementary? The supplementary is not assisted by Ms Brown interjecting on it. Thank you.

Mr WINTER - Arising from the answer given, the Premier said both that this was a plan for the future and also that no decision had been made. Which is it? Has a decision been made or is there a plan for the future?

The SPEAKER - I will allow the question as it arises from the answer given by the Premier.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Who was interjecting then? Thank you. It will stop.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Members on my right will stop as well.

Mr Abetz - Josh Willie's kids could have done a better job with that.

Mr Willie - My kids? Why are you bringing my kids into it?

Mr Abetz - Students.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Speaker, well, that is an embarrassing -

The SPEAKER - Sorry. Was there an allegation about someone's family made then?

Mr Abetz - No. Students.

The SPEAKER - Right. Okay. Thank you, Premier, with the answer.

Mr ROCKLIFF - That was an embarrassing supplementary because I have clearly outlined the work that we will undertake to investigate with the support of eminent economist, or 'premium economist' I believe the Leader of the Greens called Mr Eslake yesterday.

We will work through and have all the evidence before us to make very sensible decisions on what is in and what is out. What is in, we will be investing into a future fund in a very sensible way given the circumstances that we and other state governments find ourselves in. We have outlined a plan for growing the economy, a right-sized State Service delivering better services and a plan for a future fund for Tasmanians.


Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr BAYLEY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.30 a.m.]
Your state of the state speech might have been listless in delivery, but it announced a dramatic lurch to the right for you and your government. We all know where that comes from. One key new plank of your hard right agenda is privatisation of public entities. The Greens are fundamentally opposed to privatisation because it will mean higher prices and poorer outcomes for people. We will fight you every step of the way.

Yesterday, you revealed you are considering selling off particular entities like Metro, TasNetworks and MAIB, but there was only one you ruled out altogether, Hydro. Is Hydro the only GBE or state-owned company that is fully off the table, or are there others that you can today, here, categorically rule out?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. Hydro is the sacred cow. I am not ruling anything in or out. Why would I?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I ask members to be quiet to hear the answer.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We will examine every single GBE and whether it is best to keep it in government ownership or sell that asset and invest into a future fund.

You can scare all the people you like and talk about politics and all sorts of things. Do you think people actually care about your view in the bubble of this Chamber?

Dr Broad - I think they do.

The SPEAKER - Order, shadow attorney-general.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I do not think so. What people care about are jobs for the future and -

Dr Woodruff - We represent people, Premier.

The SPEAKER - Order, Leader of the Greens, it was not your question. The Deputy Leader would like to hear the answer.

Mr ROCKLIFF - This is what the tradies care about.

Ms Haddad - They care about their rego costs too.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Clark.

Mr ROCKLIFF - This is what people who go to work every single day to put food on the table care about. They care about the future of their state and the state that their children will inherit. We want to ensure that we provide for our children a sustainable budget moving forward, where we have the right investments in public ownership and where there is competition with the private sector and the private sector can deliver better services. If we can offload that asset into a future fund for the future, then that should be considered.

I accept your view will not change irrespective of the good arguments that we may well present. It is sensible and prudent to do this work.

Mr Shelton interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Lyons on my right.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Yesterday's announcement was about slashing red tape, about providing a business environment from which we can continue to grow as a state and employ Tasmanians. It was about sensibly outlining a plan for a public service that is the right size to deliver better quality services, but also sensibly in a measured way looking at what assets we can examine that can best be in public hands for the future and/or offloaded to support a future fund and better service delivery.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - Can I have a supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr BAYLEY - Can the Premier confirm that every single GBE except Hydro is on the table? Will he decide which ones or will there be a process on which ones are best kept in government hands versus privatised? What are the criteria against which those decisions and that assessment will be made?

Mr ROCKLIFF - I missed the last bit of the question.

Mr BAYLEY - What are the criteria against which the evaluation of each and every GBE except Hydro will be made? What will be the basis of the decision, the recommendation, you bring back to parliament?

The SPEAKER - It is a question that can be allowed because it arises from the process that the Premier spoke of in his answer. As to how much information he can give, the Premier will address what he can.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Can I assure you, Mr Bayley, that given the level of discussion in the community, and the wide range of opinions of what I outlined yesterday in my plan for the future, it is important to bring Tasmanians with us and bring this parliament with us. The best way to do that is to ensure that the main driver and the main criteria is that it is in the best interests of Tasmanians. There will be terms of reference and criteria in terms of Mr Eslake's work, alongside Treasury, of course, about the criteria for the decisions we have to make, but they will be all open and transparent to ensure that Tasmanians are engaged in this conversation. 

What I ask of this parliament, and I do not expect it from yourself necessarily -
The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the supplementary question has expired.


Efficiency and Productivity Unit - Proposal

Mrs BESWICK question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF 

[10.36 a.m.]
The Treasurer this morning announced a so-called efficiency and productivity unit, which will no doubt create nervousness across Tasmania's public service today. Why is this new unit necessary? Department secretaries and deputy secretaries are paid well to be across their part of the public service. Do you not have faith in their ability to identify efficiencies? The Tasmanian Audit Office is designed to assess the performance and accountability of the public sector. Do you not trust them to do their work either?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member, Mrs Beswick, for her question. Can I say that it is a mechanism for, once again, a very prudent and measured approach. Now, a lot of people in this Chamber and elsewhere have been referring to the Eslake report. Dr Woodruff referred to the Eslake report and recommendations yesterday, when she highlighted 'premium economist' Saul Eslake, if my memory serves me correctly.

In Saul's recent report to government, it was recommended and, from my memory, recommendation 3, that evaluation into the efficiency and effectiveness of individual spending programs should occur as part of its ongoing management of the budget. Recommendation 3: we have outlined how we will do that through this mechanism, which can ensure a very transparent and objective process in terms of a way forward. 

I welcome that.  I believe all Tasmanians would welcome the fact that a government is having a very prudent look, given our budget circumstances, at every single program to ensure that every single program is value for money for Tasmanian taxpayers and the people who those programs seek to serve. That is very sensible in in my view. Through that process, again, we will not only have better focused programs to deliver services for Tasmanians, but it aligns with our prudent budget management and our pathway to surplus.


Energy Assets - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF 

[10.38 a.m.]
Power prices have soared since you became Premier. In fact, they are the highest they have ever been. Particularly, this includes our major industrials, some of which are under incredible pressure at the moment. Will not your plan to privatise some of the most important energy assets push up power prices even higher for Tasmanian families, businesses and industrials, just as it has in other states? Why should Tasmanians pay for your budget mismanagement with higher power prices?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I reject the premise of the question. Look, I know you have done your best to be business friendly. I am not sure the left wing of the Labor Party like your focus on that, as much as you have tried over the course of the last six months or so. The last paragraph or two of their media release yesterday - I am not sure if you caught it, I know -

Mr Winter - They will never trust you again, Premier.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Well, that does not look like that, given what they said yesterday, but they called for really common sense and for the Labor Party, in particular, given that you are the alternative government, to engage in sensible conversation and take the politics out of this. All your questions today are about politics, politics, politics.

Politics, scare campaigns and Labor higher taxes are not the way of the future. They will not solve our challenges.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left, thank you.

Ms Butler interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Lyons, Ms Butler.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It is very easy to be on that side and offer no plan, but I suspect it is going to get a little harder because Tasmanians expect and deserve an alternative government. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, member for Bass. Thank you very much, member for Franklin. I am going to start issuing warnings. Please do not push it.

Mr ROCKLIFF - An opposition that wants to be in government with a plan, not a scare campaign and not one that proposes higher taxes. We expect it from that lot. We support business growth, cutting that red tape, efficient and effective public service, right size public service, and prudent financial management given the circumstances we are in.

On your point on energy prices, that is a scare campaign -

Mr Willie - What has happened on the mainland? You sell the poles and wires.

The SPEAKER - With that, Mr Willie, you are warned.

Mr ROCKLIFF - That is a scare campaign. Built-in service level guarantees, as I have said before, should an asset be sold or indeed, as I put forward yesterday, a 99-year lease for Tasmania Networks. This is the government that has delivered the lowest regulated power prices in the nation.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for the question has expired. I will ask the Premier to perhaps be a little less enticing in his commentary so we can get through Question Time without me having to eject people, thank you.


Motor Accidents Insurance Board - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.43 a.m.]
Tasmanians have been smashed with the cost-of-living increases over the last few years. Will not your plan to privatise MAIB inevitably lead to more expensive car registration fees, just as it has in other states? Why should Tasmanian families and business owners pay for your budget mismanagement with higher registration fees?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - No interjecting on the questions, thank you minister Ellis, otherwise you will be joining Mr Willie. You can both end up having a nice cup of tea outside.

ANSWER

Here we go, scare, scare, scare. I have mentioned before about service level guarantees should a sale proceed, so we can protect Tasmanian consumers. If you are not willing to engage in, frankly, sensible conversation then you are letting yourselves and Tasmanians down. What we are about is providing a solid future for the Tasmanian people and generations of Tasmanians.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Sorry, Premier, I am going to stop you to remind people that Mr Willie, member for Clark, is warned; and Ms Brown, member for Franklin, is warned. Please do not allow me to have others on this list. 

Premier, you may go to the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I am not interested in a scare campaign. I would embrace sensible conversations, for once in your lives, on this very important matter. I am not sure I am going to get it unfortunately. The business community wants you to engage in sensible conversation and take the politics out of this and make sure that we are having a good conversation in this minority government situation in the best interests of Tasmanians.

We will work through what we outlined yesterday in a sensible and prudent way where we can encourage businesses to invest, grow and employ people by cutting red tape, and creating an economy that is conducive to investment, where we will have the right sized public service to deliver quality services for the Tasmanian people, and where we can look at our assets across government and those that we need to keep in government ownership in the best interest of the Tasmanian people, and those that we can divest and put into our future fund in the best interest of the Tasmanian people.

Public Service Cuts

Ms BURNET question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.46 a.m.]
The evidence is clear. Cuts to any part of the public service will impact services Tasmanians rely on and undermine our institutions. We are already seeing problems in the health system thanks to your hiring freeze: delays in recruiting staff and increases in workload for nurses, doctors, paramedics and allied health workers. Now, you want to make sweeping cuts across the board. Yesterday, you announced that you would be looking at every government program and that if you think something is not a priority, you will take the chainsaw to it. Today, you revealed your ludicrous plan to copycat the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Just to be crystal clear: are you saying no program or worker in any government department or agency is out of the firing line? Are there any you can immediately rule out for consideration by Rockliff's razor gang, or should we start calling you Elon?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, I did not hear the last part of your question. Could you please say it again? Members on my right on the backbench were being a little bit loud. Last part of the question, please.

Ms BURNET - Are there any you can immediately rule out for consideration by Rockliff's razor gang, or should we start calling you Elon?

The SPEAKER - I probably did not need that bit to be re-read into the Hansard. I would have known that had members of the Liberal Party not been interjecting. 

I will call the Premier to the question. You bring this on yourselves, people.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, the Greens are coming up with the zingers, are they not? The last couple of days - they have worked very hard over the last few months - we have a few zingers in. Congratulations. It is a different sort of modus operandi in terms of Question Time, but well done. Also, well done on changing your position quite a lot, really, within 24 hours. We had 'premium economist Saul' yesterday. Now it appears that you are rejecting recommendations 3 and 11 of Mr Eslake's report, which highlights your inconsistency and hypocrisy. 

Ms BURNET - Point of order, Speaker, I draw the Premier's attention to the original question.

The SPEAKER – Standing Order 45, relevance, was your point. The Premier is addressing the more flippant second part of your question perhaps, but I will draw him to the more serious first part of your question.

Mr Bayley - Are any public servants safe?

The SPEAKER - I can ask him to do that without your assistance, Mr Bayley.

Mr ROCKLIFF - That was a long question -

The SPEAKER - It was a long preamble, I think.

Mr ROCKLIFF - which has been repeated twice towards the end. The first part of the question, as I recall it, was about health service delivery. That could have been the question that I would have asked in 2011 when you were sacking nurses and putting hospital beds in storage. Now, for those interested observers -

The SPEAKER - Such as myself, Premier. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - that is not what I am going to do. I am not going to constrict the economy with massive cuts to the public service and impact on services that you genuinely care about. I understand that. We have employed 2500 more frontline professionals in a relatively short amount of time to support the growth in health demand, as an example. We have worked really hard to recruit frontline professionals. It is really hard in an environment where every other state is competing for those health professionals. That is why we have been so successful in recruiting people from the UK and other places from around the world to come, to live, to work, to invest and to raise their families in Tasmania, which is fantastic. I am not going to impact on that because what the -

Dr BROAD - That is the 2500 that you have to get rid of.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Please engage in sensible conversation, Dr Broad.

Dr Broad - Well, that is what you said. 

The SPEAKER - Premier, it is not a conversation. You are required to answer the question that was asked by the member for Clark, who I believe is now jumping for her supplementary.

Supplementary Question

Ms BURNET - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms BURNET - The Premier came nowhere near my question. I will say it again: are there any positions you can immediately rule out for consideration by the Rockliff razor gang?

The SPEAKER - The Premier addressed a long preamble and the second part of your question, but that was the first part of your actual question. I call the Premier to that now.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We are looking at all programs - programs that deliver for Tasmanians. This is all about priorities. We want to ensure that all government programs are prioritised towards service delivery for Tasmanians. Why would we not embark on a really prudent look at those programs to ensure that Tasmanians are getting the best value for money, not only for their taxpayer dollar, but ensuring that we are applying those resources in the most effective way in terms of delivering those quality services? This is what we are embarking on. This is what we will do, as per recommendation 3 of 'premium economist' Saul Eslake's report.

The SPEAKER - Premier, I know you are always asked all the questions, but resuming your seat might be prudent.


Stadium - Scrutiny of Dr Nicholas Gruen's Independent Review

Mrs PENTLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.52 a.m.]
In June last year during Question Time, I asked you how the government would treat the independent review of the stadium. You assured this House that your government would absorb and take seriously any information provided regarding stadium infrastructure and would provide a fulsome statement on such matters. 

However, despite receiving Dr Nicholas Gruen's independent review, the government has pushed ahead with its stadium plans as if the report never existed. How do you justify completely ignoring the very review your government commissioned? What does this say about your commitment to evidence-based decision-making?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I understand there are various views around Tasmania about stadia infrastructure. There has been a bit said about Dr Gruen's report. Some disagree with the findings. Others have used it to be anti-stadium, if you like. This is a project that Tasmanians well and truly know where I stand on and will continue to stand very firmly. We have bipartisan support, I think.

Mr Winter - I think I will speak about it in the speech. I might even speak about it in the speech today.

The SPEAKER - Which we will not get to if I leave the Chair, so no interjecting, please.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Exactly. We have gone from 'No Stadium' bumper stickers to bipartisan support, which is good at this particular stage. 

There is an economic opportunity. Dr Gruen has done his work, and we appreciate that, but in my humble opinion the way forward that we propose for Macquarie Point is the right way forward. That is the way that we are proceeding now in the planning system. That is what we are proceeding with in terms of attracting private investment in the precinct as well. That is why we believe this is an economic opportunity and a job-creating opportunity for Tasmanians in an area that has been underdeveloped and underutilised for decades. 

Again, it is very prudent that we would look at an area that is underdeveloped and at how we can maximise that opportunity not just for southern Tasmania, but for all Tasmanians. That is why we are pushing forward with the proposal as outlined.


State Service - Hiring Freeze

Ms JOHNSTON question to TREASURER, Mr BARNETT

[10.55 a.m.]
Yesterday, the acting secretary of the Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management sent an e-mail to all staff. The acting secretary said the department was working to understand your hiring freeze. The department told staff that recruitment processes already underway, but not at the stage when an offer has been made and accepted, will be paused. Clearly, all recruitment will halt until you figure out who is essential and who is non-essential. In the meantime, important services which Tasmanians rely upon are impacted. Talented potential recruits will be left high and dry and recruitment resources have been wasted.

Will you admit your hiring freeze policy is impacting negatively on all public servants and all public services Tasmanians rely upon? Will you admit that your claim of targeting only non-essential workers is nothing but a PR sham? 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. As the Premier made very clear yesterday, we need a right-sized public service. We have had an 18 per cent increase in the public service in the last five years and a five per cent increase in our population. That is very important to acknowledge and recognise. 

I will, at this point, acknowledge and recognise the new member for Lyons, Casey Farrell. Congratulations, well done. I look forward to working with you.

This is not about slash and burn. This is about ensuring we have the right size. The Premier and I made that clear yesterday. The decisions in terms of essential/non-essential in the process is absolutely important for the secretaries of the relevant departments who are absolutely capable. They are professional, they have the capacity and those tools necessary to make those decisions. They do have that discretion, consistent with the objectives of our government to get to a right size.

They will need to consult with the Head of the State Service and we are not backing away from ensuring that we have an effective and efficient and productive public service. The hiring freeze for non-essential public sector workers is exactly what it will do. It will start on Sunday and it will progress accordingly. 

Supplementary Question

Ms JOHNSTON - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Ms JOHNSTON - Can the Treasurer confirm that there is an immediate halt on hiring and recruitment processes until departments figure out what you mean by essential or non-essential? 

The SPEAKER - That was the original question, Treasurer. I will draw you to that. 
Mr BARNETT - Through you, Speaker, I thank the member for her supplementary question. I have made it very clear in terms of the decisions, with respect to on a case-by-case basis, will be made by the relevant heads of agencies in consultation with the Head of the State Service. 


Fishing Industry - Employment Numbers

Mr JENNER question to MINISTER for BUSINESS, INDUSTRY and RESOURCES, Mr ABETZ

[10.59 a.m.]
A report has come out today from the Australia Institute of Tasmania about the Macquarie Harbour salmon company and claims that they had 400 people employed there. It has come out that they actually only employ 69. We know that salmon farms have a detrimental impact on our oceans and we also know that hundreds of Tasmanian fishermen and their families have lost their livelihoods in the last 10 to 15 years, which coincides with the salmon industry's massive expansion. 

Although the salmon industry provides jobs on one hand, we are losing them on the other hand. Can this government tell me how many jobs have been lost in the fishing industry around the Tasmanian coast in the last 10 to 15 years and how this government can justify prioritising a billion-dollar overseas company over small Tasmanian-run family businesses?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, the reason why we need fish farms is that our wild fisheries are no longer able to provide the fish that we require for human consumption. The reason we farm beef, lamb and chicken is because there are not enough of them in the wild. Similarly, with fish. Our health experts tell us that we do well to have at least one or two meals of fish per week. What you need to do is ask the question: do we continue to exploit the wild fisheries where a lot of them are on the decline or do we - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Sorry, I think I have - you do need to say point of order. 

Mr JENNER - Point of order, Speaker, I was asking about jobs. There was a comparison there that they have been saying this for 400 jobs and that is why - and now it is 69 - we are losing hundreds of jobs.

The SPEAKER - The member will resume his seat. Other members will stop helping. The minister will address the question regarding employment in the industry, which was the question. 

Mr ABETZ - Speaker, with respect -

The SPEAKER - You have two minutes.

Mr ABETZ - there were many aspects to the question that questioned the viability or appropriateness of fish farming and I was just outlining the importance of that. 

The simple fact is that our wild fisheries are in decline because of overfishing. As a minister quite some time ago, in the federal parliament I had to close the Bass Strait Scallop Fishery to allow it to rehabilitate. At the time, I was highly criticised because of the impact on jobs. Today, it is a viable fishery and those who went to the Bridport scallop fest will see that it is now once again a vibrant fishing sector. What we need in this is balance and I would like to think that in my period as a minister federally, I have been able to show the need for that balance. To assert that the wild fishery jobs have been lost because of salmon farming is, with respect, unsustainable. 

Similarly, whilst I know that the Australia Institute should in fact be called the Australian Greens Institute because that is the event that is their leaning, but I was at a BBQ with workers in Strahan, at the salmon farms there, and I can tell you there were more than 69 people there. Clearly, in Macquarie Harbour more than 69 people were there because Macquarie Harbour is a lot bigger than Strahan itself. I can assure you that the number of workers that I rubbed shoulders with and had conversations with numbered a lot more than the manufactured figure from the Australia Institute. 


Tasmanian Law Quota

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.03 a.m.]
Yesterday, you declared Tasmania has too many laws. You did not give any examples. You just want fewer laws. If this was not inexplicably stupid enough, you then announced your ministers will have a one law in/one out policy. Want to regulate a new technology or product? You have to deregulate another. Want to introduce a new elder abuse crime? Better legalise arson. 

It is a fact that as our society develops and gets more complex, a greater amount of legislation is required. A law quota cannot and will not work. This is a pathetic far right virtue signalling on your part and we are honestly embarrassed for you. Will you put this reckless, radical rhetoric behind you and commit to approaching legislation like a sensible adult? Or will this parliament have to spend the rest of the term supervising you like a babysitter? 

Mr Ellis - What did you do yesterday? 

The SPEAKER - Before I call the Premier to answer the question - and tell Mr Ellis that he just got his first warning - I note that there is an awful lot of latitude given in questions and the preambles to questions. The Standing Orders require that they do not contain argument or opinion. Some of the comments made in the question stray a little close to being personal remarks. I remind members of that for the future. However, the question stands.

ANSWER 

Honourable Speaker, I thank the Leader of the Greens, Dr Woodruff, for the question. I am not sure what you did over the summer, but you have come back a little differently with some of the -

Dr Woodruff - I have been walking in the wilderness and I am feeling very energised, thank you.

Mr ROCKLIFF - A little too much sun? I do not know, but the zingers, the personal attacks and questions laced with irony - first, when you talk about embarrassment, these types of questions are embarrassing. 

You presented some legislation to me yesterday which I can rule out. We spoke about that yesterday. Why would we not look at the laws that are no longer applicable in 2025? Why would we not look at areas of regulation that are burdensome to business, small, medium or large? I clearly laid down criteria for protecting the environment, looking after the community, public safety, and other areas. We need to make sure we have the best possible laws across those three areas, but there are other areas of regulation that are simply getting in people's way. I hear it often.

The Business Council of Australia report 37 licences to open a cafe. That is state, federal and local. There are federal laws which we have less influence on, but surely as local and state governments we can work together on ensuring that there is regulation there to protect consumers, but also regulation that we can take away that is strangling business. Business in Tasmania is very resilient despite this, but we can make it easier. I look forward to the work in this Chamber where we do take away unnecessary and burdensome regulation and laws.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - My question was whether the Premier would put the radical, reckless rhetoric behind. That was specifically about the one law in/one law out policy. That is not sensible or moderate. Will you please tell Tasmanians whether you are going to stay committed to that approach?

The SPEAKER - I draw the Premier to it; it was part of the original question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We talk about 'radical' and 'reckless'. We talk about community safety. What about your endorsement of people climbing the roof of this heritage building yesterday?

Dr WOODRUFF - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. 

The SPEAKER - I will accept the point of order, Standing Order 45, relevance. Premier, I draw you to the supplementary question. You only have 35 seconds left. I am more than happy to countenance debate on that other issue at another time.

Dr Woodruff - One law in/one law out. Are you going to stick to it?

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Leader of the Greens. You are warned as well for constant interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I always respect your ruling, honourable Speaker. The member mentioned 'radical' and 'reckless'. That is exactly how I would describe your mates climbing the roof yesterday. I was very disappointed to see endorsement of such actions which not only can cause damage to a heritage building but put their own safety and staff safety at risk

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. I call the Leader of the Opposition. We are almost there. Let us keep everyone in the room.


Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.09 a.m.]
You have wrecked the budget and now plan to sell some of Tasmania's most valuable assets to try to cover up your mess. Tasmanians know this will only make things worse. After the energy assets were privatised in Victoria in the 1990s, power prices increased by 170 per cent. Four out of every five jobs were lost at these privatised companies. Blackouts increased by 32 per cent. Do you seriously think that higher power prices, job losses and blackouts are the answer to Tasmania's problems?

ANSWER

Why do you incessantly scare people?

The SPEAKER - I ask the Premier to direct his answers through the Chair because, at this stage, you have just asked me why I am frightening people. I do want to frighten you all into silence, but that is about it.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Speaker, why does the Leader of the Opposition reject a plan for the future with a scare campaign and higher taxes? That is the member's plan. I urge the member to take a peek at the business community media release yesterday, where the TCCI calls on the Labor Party to back in these reforms.

Mr Winter - They can never trust you again, can they?

The SPEAKER - Order, Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ROCKLIFF - They are vital for Tasmania's future. I know it would be easy for the opposition to play politics with such an ambitious agenda, but we are at a critical point in time for the state. In the interests of Tasmania, business and industry and the community more broadly, the TCCI calls on the parliament to work together to deliver these vital reforms and to hold the government accountable for delivering these reforms.

Let us engage in a sensible conversation. I came here yesterday, I outlined our plan for Tasmania's future, how we get our budget to a pathway to surplus, how we can invest for the future, how we can cut red tape to support business growth, and how we can have the right-sized public service to deliver quality services. That is my plan.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The member for Lyons is warned.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You have no plan. Your only plan is higher taxes. Taxes in a cost-of-living crisis are not what Tasmanians want from the Labor Party. 

Mr Willie - You cannot even point to one. It is rubbish.

The SPEAKER - Mr Willie, you have your second warning. One more word from you and you will not be here to hear the Leader of the Opposition's response to the state of the state.


Energy Assets - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.12 a.m.]
Tasmanians have built our renewable energy assets over 100 years. We have invested in renewable energy to underpin Tasmanian industry, to create jobs and to keep prices down to pay for our schools and our hospitals. This is a system that has sustained thousands of jobs in our major industrials for a century. Why are you so willing to put all of this at risk? Will you guarantee that your plan to sell off our energy assets will not lead to higher prices, damage to industry, job losses, and less money for schools and hospitals?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, it was the Labor Party that wanted to gut and destroy Hydro, albeit for 24 hours during the election campaign. I am sure you remember it, Speaker. I remember it. I still look back on it and shake my head at how they could have such a proposal, firstly to gut Hydro and secondly to ditch the policy within 24 hours.

What we are committed to is keeping Hydro, our energy generating asset. Alright? The sacred cow kept in Tasmanian hands. What I have put on the table is the idea of a 99-year lease for TasNetworks. Why would we not consider that? Momentum Energy, why would we not consider selling that, for example, and to have a very sensible conversation about it, but this kind of politics is short-term, alright?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left, there will be a general warning issued if this continues.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You will be found out. Tasmanians want a government with a plan, and a plan for the future. We have that plan and you do not. You have a scare campaign and higher taxes.


Salmon Industry - Disease Outbreak and Ocean Debris

Mr GARLAND question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Ms HOWLETT

[11.15 a.m.]
Last night, the ABC was reporting an email from the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) dated 3 March referring to Department of Health advice warning people not to handle any of the fat balls washing up. However, no warnings had been made public until yesterday, when the public were warned to avoid recreational activities that will bring them into contact with dead fish. This has been going on for weeks now. 

Salmon Tasmania CEO, Luke Martin, told ABC last week it was important the appropriate regulatory and expert bodies provided information to the community as quickly and efficiently as possible. The Chief Vet is yet reported to have said yesterday that testing was recently finalised and the bacteria is something known as P. (Piscirickettsia) salmonis. However, they did not say which specific strain it was.

When was the testing finalised? Which strain of P. salmonis are we dealing with? When will the public be provided with details about the emergency disease response plan which is required to be developed by the Chief Veterinary Officer?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, we acknowledge the community concerns about this matter. We also acknowledge the challenging situation that salmon companies have been dealing with due to the high number of fish losses occurring within a short period of time. Fish deaths are a known aspect of salmon farming worldwide. From an environmental perspective, the critical issue is timely collection and management of fish residue in an appropriate manner.

These incidents are typically elevated during the summer months, when warmer waters and other factors affecting salmon health are more likely to occur. Reports over recent months suggest widespread availability of nutrients along the East and Southeast coasts of Tasmania, brought in by the East Australian Current.

The Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) remains the agency responsible for managing the fish mortality event and associated deposit of fatty substances in the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. Public Health is providing advice to the EPA. I am advised that testing undertaken by the EPA has demonstrated the fatty substances are derived from fish and all fish oil.

The bacteria infection causing the mortality does not cause human disease. The advice remains not to handle or consume dead fish or such substances. If you do touch them, wash your hands. Importantly, breaches remain open for use and no advice has been issued contrary to this. Members of the public can call the Public Health hotline 1800 671 738 if they have questions or concerns.

Supplementary Question

Mr GARLAND - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr GARLAND - When was the testing finalised? What strain of P. salmonis was it? That has not been answered. When will the public be provided with the details about the Emergency Disease Response Plan which is required to be developed by the Chief Veterinary Officer?

The SPEAKER - The supplementary question is in order as it is the actual question that you were asked.

Ms HOWLETT - I will take that on notice and I will provide the relevant answer for you as soon as possible.

The SPEAKER - Confirming that is taken on notice with the government and hopefully we can get that by the end of the day. If it is not impossible, we still have one outstanding from yesterday, I believe. 

On that basis, we have now concluded Question Time and we move into constituency questions. 

Time expired.


CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Illawarra Road - Speed Limit and Truck Stop 

Ms BUTLER question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE, Mr VINCENT

[11.19 a.m.]
My question is on behalf of Illawarra Road land owners. Planning to upgrade Illawarra Road from a B Road to National Highway began in 2020 with the Public Works Committee approving a budget of $80 million in 2022. The committee was incorrectly advised that community consultation raised no major landowner concerns. Illawarra Road carries many slow moving farm vehicles, creating unresolved challenges for repurposing. Since a truck stop opened in early 2023, fast moving heavy vehicle traffic continues to significantly increase.

This project, due for completion last year, remains three quarters unchanged. Despite four years of requests from land owners and local councils, based on safety and noise concerns, State Roads has rejected lowering the remaining 100 kilometres an hour speed limit to a uniform 90 kilometres an hour. A recent consultant's report proposing alternatives was also dismissed. Has the minister reviewed this report? Could the minister advise the House why landowners' concerns and recommendations have been ignored?
Land Use Zoning - Change of Post-Mortem Donated Land

Ms BURNET question to MINISTER for HOUSING, PLANNING and CONSUMER AFFAIRS, Mr ELLIS

My question is from Shannon from Hobart. Around Tasmania, land has been donated by individuals or their family post mortem in their memory for community use. It is being used by state or local governments and zoning is being changed from community use. What right do state and local governments have to take and modify land that has been donated in good faith to the community for their use in perpetuity?


Tasmanian Fire Service - Recruitment Freeze

Ms JOHNSTON question to TREASURER, Mr BARNETT

My question is on behalf of a constituent who fears that they may be a non-essential worker. According to the email that they received from the acting secretary of the Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management (DPFEM), police officers and firefighters are deemed essential workers, the implication being that all other classes of employees within DPFEM are deemed non-essential. This has significant implications for Tasmanian Fire Service (TFS) employees, particularly as there are many more non-essential workers currently responding to and managing the multiple out-of-control bushfires on the west coast than essential workers.

The question they have is: does the hiring freeze apply to the Tasmanian Fire Service at all? How many paid career TFS firefighters - essential workers - are currently working on the bush fire response? How many non-essential government employees who are not firefighters are currently working on the bush fire response? If all the workers deemed non-essential from TFS and from Parks and Wildlife Services walked off the job today, could Tasmania Fire Service resource the management of the fire?


Mole Creek - Rabbit Management 

Mr SHELTON question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Ms HOWLETT

Recently, a constituent from Mole Creek contacted me regarding rabbit management in the area given calicivirus has now been released. What else can be done to control rabbits in and around the virus release to make it as successful as possible? Are there any other approaches to rabbit management?


Number of Licences Required to Run a Cafe

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

A constituent of mine has started a cafe. He is alarmed by your claim that he needs 37 licences and is concerned he is going to get pinged by your army of red tape enforcers. Can you please list the 37 licences he requires to run his cafe?


Forth Road - Potholes

Mrs BESWICK question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE, Mr VINCENT

A constituent has raised concern about two dangerous potholes on Forth Road, approximately 200 metres uphill from George Street. There seems to be an ongoing confusion over which authority is responsible for maintaining this section of road. Correspondence from Devonport City Council suggests the section from Forth Side Road to beyond the bridge is under the Department of State Growth.

Given the safety risks posed by the long-standing potholes and the apparent lack of accountability, can the minister clarify which authority is responsible for this section of road and ensure that urgent repairs are carried out?


Sporting Clubs - State Funding

Mr FERGUSON question to MINISTER for SPORT and EVENTS, Mr DUIGAN

I am frequently approached by sporting clubs in my electorate of Bass that are in need of infrastructure upgrades. Given the Tasmanian Government's commitment to keeping people active and engaged with their communities, I am asking the minister what the upcoming opportunities are for these clubs to receive assistance. Second, how can these clubs be using the intervening time to prepare for upcoming opportunities?

MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Privatisation Agenda

[11.34 a.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House take note of the following matter: privatisation agenda.

I speak, this morning, on behalf of the Greens about the government selling off Tasmania. The government can dress up their plans to support enterprise and business any way they like, but the reality is that they want to carve up Tasmania and sell it off. There is so much of value and worth in our beautiful state: the people of Tasmania; our incredible Tasmanian public service that works so hard to ensure our people have what they need; our public assets, including government business enterprises; and our stunning natural environment, including beaches, waterways, mountains and forests.

These belong to all of us as Tasmanians, yet the Premier stood in this Chamber yesterday and outlined the Liberals' extreme plan that, if it goes ahead, will ultimately result in the trashing of all these treasures that belong to us, that make us, that sustain us. After yesterday's address there can be no doubt in anyone's mind the Liberals plan to push full steam ahead with the selling off of Tasmania and the destruction of all that is dear to us.
The reach of their plans are outstanding. Nothing is safe from this Liberal government drunk on right-wing ideology, fuelled by donations from their business mates who cannot wait to get their hands on our services, our assets, our forests and environment - the essence of Tasmania - so they can increase their profits and grow their personal wealth. The Liberals are not governing with heart, unless by heart they mean a stone-cold heart that loves money above all else. The government has an agenda that puts privatisation and profits before people. This is deeply disturbing. The Greens will work to expose what the government is doing and fight it all the way.

While all of this is audacious, astounding and outrageous, it is not really surprising. We have already seen the government steering in this direction with their efficiency dividends, hiring freezes and general unwillingness to do what it takes to ensure the needs of Tasmanians are well met so they are able to live safe, healthy, fulfilling, productive lives. Take health services in Tasmania for example. The razor has long been taken to these services. Efficiency dividends and vacancy control measures have left positions unfilled within the health service. The government like to tell us they are protecting frontline services, but they have not once defined frontline services and they fail to acknowledge that every single health worker is essential to the provision of smooth, well-functioning service provision. Efficiency dividends and vacancy control sells out Tasmanians.

Over the weekend, the Treasurer announced that the Liberal Government is introducing a hiring freeze on non-essential positions. What even is a non-essential position? Everyone who works in our public service is providing an essential service to Tasmanians across the full spectrum of government departments and services. There is no such thing as a non-essential position. Administration staff create pathways for good organisation and movement of information and Tasmanians through our services. Cleaners make sure environments are safe and clear and everyone can perform their role unhindered. Allied health staff perform tests, provide therapy, give support, and organise equipment - all functions that are essential to healthcare provision in Tasmania. Managers see the big picture and plan for both the immediate and long-term. Nurses, doctors and paramedics provide services on the ground. They are the workers we most identify with the health service, but they are one piece of the whole and without the other pieces they cannot do their job. 

The government can dress their actions with whatever fancy dressing and slick terminology they like, but an efficiency dividend is a cut. Vacancy control is a cut. A hiring freeze is a cut. Letting jobs slide away through natural attrition is a cut. Their cuts will result in service deterioration and service deterioration means Tasmanians will miss out. If the government are willing to cut staff and services and let Tasmanians miss out, what else are they willing to do to the detriment of Tasmanians?

The Greens will not let the government sell off Tasmania without a fight. We stand with the people of Tasmania, we stand with the public service, we stand for protecting our public assets and we stand for our precious natural environment. Tasmania deserves so much better than this Liberal government. 

[11.39 a.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Attorney-General) - Deputy Speaker, I am very pleased to be here as Deputy Premier, Treasurer and Attorney-General to respond to these unfair accusations and allegations made by the Greens but raised by state Labor in this parliament today.

I pass on congratulations to the Premier on his state of the state address. It was outstanding in terms of making it very clear that as a government we have an assault on red tape and regulation, to get out of the way of business, small, medium and large, to get on with business. We will undertake an audit of government programs and services to ensure that there is an effective, efficient and productive public service delivering the services that the Tasmanian people believe are appropriate and a priority. Of course, there will be an assessment of the suitability of divesting a number of government-owned businesses. 

There have been allegations made in this place regarding the mandate. We have a mandate to grow the economy and not to increase new taxes. What we have learnt today from state Labor is that they have a scare campaign - that is what they are on about - and they want to increase new taxes. They want to increase our taxes and bring in new taxes. This has been confirmed today by the Leader of the Opposition in all his questions rejecting the Premier's plans, which have been described as the most ambitious plans in two decades for this parliament.

We have a plan. We are so pleased to have the backing of business for that plan. The Labor Party has no plan other than a scare campaign and an increase in taxes. That is what they are on about. That is what they are doing. Make no mistake -

Dr Broad - That is not a scare campaign, is it? It is something that is based on zero facts.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Member on my left, order.

Mr BARNETT - Well, we have had an interjection from Dr Broad.

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order.

Mr BARNETT - Dr Broad was there during the election campaign when you put forward your $2 billion of cuts to the Public Service, and what happened? I think there were 11 changes to this document.

Mr Willie - That is made up by one of your advisers. It is not even true. I know for a fact.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr Willie, order.

Mr BARNETT - We have seen no policies, no plans, no alternative budget. We hear chipping in comments from the shadow treasurer there. Well, time to stand up, offer a plan, offer an alternative budget, offer a costed policy. Not one costed policy has been delivered by state Labor. You have had plenty of time.

Mr Willie - You liked that GBE reform so much that you copied it.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr Willie, order.

Mr BARNETT - I am so pleased and proud of our GBE reform agenda. We have worked shoulder to shoulder with business. We had a discussion paper and we got the 48 submissions feedback. Guess what? It was positive feedback. It was good engagement. I have had roundtables together with the Premier and others with those business groups. We have established reference groups. It is working. There is positive collaboration.

There is a broad range of views, particularly with respect to divestment. The discussion paper that was put out in November included that very point - should these government business enterprises be divested or not? You are acting as though this is not part of a long-term plan. The Premier has made it very clear it is part of our long-term plan and that assessment will be undertaken.

Dr Woodruff - You never talked about it. Do not rewrite history.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order, Dr Woodruff.

Mr BARNETT - I thank Saul Eslake for being willing to lead that assessment and review and provide that advice back to government and in due course to the public and to the parliament.

Mr Willie - You will probably ignore it like you ignored his last report.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order, Mr Willie.

Mr BARNETT - I do not accept the views of the Greens. Having so many months to come up with a few zingers, it has come up with an absolute fizzer in parliament today. Some of those remarks by the Leader of the Greens should be called into question.

We have always said we want a team Tasmania approach. I am so pleased and proud that the plan backs that in, to grow our economy, back in business, and back in jobs. That is exactly what we are doing. We want a right-sized public service and that is what we will be delivering - an 18 per cent increase over a five year period for our public service. They are the facts on the record: a 5 per cent increase in terms of our population. That is why it is important to have that review. We are proud to back in the government's agenda.

Time expired.

[11.44 a.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Deputy Speaker, the news of public service cuts does raise serious concern for our Parks and Wildlife Service, the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania (NRE), who are already underfunded and seriously under-resourced. What will this mean for critical sites like Mount Pleasant? What will it mean for the forgotten segment of Parks and Wildlife amid an extinction and biodiversity crisis? What will it mean for biosecurity? NRE is an absolute essential service: everybody in the entire NRE. It must be growing, not shrinking.

Exactly what these cuts will be we do not know because we still do not have a definition of what 'essential workers' and 'frontline workers' actually are. As we heard from the Premier yesterday, if you wear high-vis, you will have no greater support than this government. Perhaps all Parks staff, NRE, Land Titles Office staff and public service workers should start wearing high-vis.

We do not want to see Trumpian style politics creep into our Parks and Wildlife Service, into our World Heritage Area. In the United States in the past month, more than 4000 national parks and forest workers have lost their jobs as President Trump, Elon Musk, and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) shrinking the federal workforce. These cuts have already had a huge impact. We are seeing visitors in huge lines at park entrances, trails are being closed and public facilities are not being cleaned. How would it look if we saw anything like this happen in Tasmania? What would that do for our global nature-based tourism brand?

Dr Woodruff - A disaster.

Ms BADGER - It would, indeed, be a disaster, Dr Woodruff. Part of the US cuts are also to the fire service and that is unthinkable here when we consider any kind of cuts or recruitment freeze, as over 100,000 hectares of ancient landscape are still burning on our west coast. I know Ms Johnston mentioned it this morning but I would like to read into the Hansard part of the email from acting secretary of the TFS. 

Subject: Recruitment Freeze Update;

The government has identified that the freeze does not apply to frontline services such as sworn Tasmania Police officers and Tasmania Fire Service firefighters; however we recognise all services provided by our staff are important to supporting and delivering our responsibilities to a safe Tasmanian community and workforce.

On Monday, when the Premier said that there would be a comprehensive review of government programs, it was to eliminate duplication waste and unnecessary spending. Well, one example of wasteful and non-essential spending is the failed tourism expression of interest process, which, in the past decade, has seen just nine projects commence. There are no doubts that the cuts to political moves like EOI is not what this government has in mind, so what do the Liberals consider examples of important and essential expenditure within our parks?

The proposed $40 million Tyndall Range Walk, which over the weekend the government admitted its own ill logic in designing the walk initially and has now made changes, including coming to the realisation that some people actually like camping in a tent and do not need a gimmicky two-person private pod. There was also a soft launch of a privatisation of commercial operations on the publicly funded walk that was done through the frequently asked questions sheet.

Is this possibly a hint of the lack of otherwise viability for this project because where is the current updated business case or feasibility study? That $40 million price tag has been on this project since 2021 and Tasmanians are not fooled into thinking that inflation somehow has miraculously not affected this project, not to mention the ongoing design changes. The Tyndall's Walk is non-essential and the government should, if it wants to just splash around $40 million, put that straight into growing and not shrinking our park service. 

What about the Cradle Mountain cableway? Let us not forget that started at $60 million with a 50/50 split between the state and federal government. I cannot remember if it was Monday or Tuesday, the Premier said, as their federal election asks, 'They were asking for $180 million for the cableway and an 80 per cent split from the federal government'. If the $180 million is now the 80 per cent split, that makes it $225 million that this cableway has now increased to, from $60 million. 

State Growth said they were making a revised business case for the cableway. Where is it? If this price has been updated that we can go to the feds for it, we need that business case. Last time the federal government did not come to the party because we did not have a business case, so is this government going back and repeating the past without the proper paperwork being in place?

Acting Chair, to conserve and protect our wild places we have to have a fully resourced, upscaled Parks and Wildlife Service and NRE. Our Parks and World Heritage Area are our state's greatest safeguard against biodiversity loss and they are our climate protection assets. Let us get our priorities right and ensure our magnificent wild places remain so for future generations.

[11.49 a.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, before I start, I welcome Casey Farrell, member for Lyons on our side of the House. I have known Casey for a number of years now and we are very excited about the contribution he will make to this parliament. His background is small business and enterprise and it is a great day that he has taken his place.

In terms of privatisation, the Liberal government did not take their privatisation agenda to the election because they know, in the Tasmanian community, it stinks. Tasmanians know that privatisation is a failed experiment. It has not worked anywhere in the country. They know that the motive for these businesses goes from the general public welfare to a profit motive and that there is a big focus on the bottom line, which means reduced services, higher prices - and just yesterday we had the Health minister in here, lamenting about a private health service with a board overseas that has no connection to the Tasmanian community, making decisions driven by profit because services are not profitable, lamenting what had happened here in Hobart with the Hobart Private Hospital and maternity services. We had the Health minister, a member of this government, talking about that. What do you think is going to happen if you privatise some of these government businesses? They may have boards with no connection to Tasmania. They will be driven by profit and they will reduce services. 

We know that this failed experiment of privatisation can lead to inequality and you are talking about privatising public transport. That could mean fewer services from some of our most disadvantaged suburbs. It could mean higher prices, bus fares where people in these communities have no other form of transport, unable to participate in the community, and unable to get to work because it becomes unaffordable. It increases inequality. We know that from failed experiments all over the globe.

We also know that when you privatise businesses, you decrease accountability. We have seen accountability play out in this parliament in the last 12 months when it comes to government businesses. We have elected representatives in here who are accountable and some of them have paid a high price, I admit, but ultimately under our system they are responsible. The buck stops with the elected members in this place.

It also allows for transparency and democratic change. We have seen that play out in the last 12 months. We have seen people take responsibility. We have seen democratic change in terms of reforms. If you privatise businesses, you decrease accountability and you take that away.

We also know that when you privatise businesses it leads to job losses. It is bad for workers and we have seen that play out in Victoria in terms of the power companies: massive job losses for workers because the motive of these companies goes from the general welfare of the community to a profit driven one - mass sackings of the workforce.

We also know that this is a short-sighted fire sale because this government has destroyed the state's finances. It is history repeating itself. Back in the 90s we had a Liberal government, drowning in debt, propose to sell the Hydro. Now, we have another minority Liberal government drowning in debt proposing to sell everything else and it is selling the state's future.

There are $500 million of dividends that help to pay for schools and hospitals in the budget. They are going to take that away through selling these government businesses, making it more difficult for future governments to fund those essential services that Tasmanians rely on.

Why should Tasmanians pay for this government's mismanagement of the budget? We have record deficits in the last two years: the biggest deficits in the state's history; not just small blowouts, but blowouts to the tune of $470 million we had just tabled yesterday, coming here with the Liberal credit card out saying, 'Please parliament, can you help us continue to spend money we do not have because we cannot manage the state's finances?'

It is going to be Tasmanians who pay the ultimate price of this budget mismanagement from this government and it will be this government's legacy. People in generations to come will be talking about the Rockliff minority government that sent the state bankrupt and tried to sell the state's future.

[11.54 a.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Well, roll up, roll up. We have the great Tasmanian fire sale courtesy of the Rockliff razor gang, the sale of assets and public institutions, and a huge scare campaign scaring the pants off 37,000 public servants across Tasmania. From Smithton to Geeveston, from Launceston to Hobart and everywhere in between, people are scared about what this government will be doing to cut the bejesus out of public service institutions. It is just not good enough. It is not visionary as the Premier has suggested his speech yesterday was. It is an insult to those institutions and those public servants who should be looking at a government that is looking out for them. That is not what we are seeing.

I stood this morning with members of unions: public servants who were not so much worried about their own jobs, but they were concerned about those institutions they have worked so hard in over many years, institutions right across the public service. It is a huge concern to think that this is going to undermine rather than build up what we have.

Interesting captain's pick by the Premier in tapping Saul Eslake on the shoulder. Saul Eslake, from what I remember - Mr Bayley, can you remind me? Was Saul Eslake just disregarded? His advice disregarded, recently, by the Premier?

Mr Bayley - 100 per cent.

Ms BURNET - Not only Saul Eslake, but that is a common pattern by the Premier, unfortunately. This government has had the Gruen Report which was released on 1 January, which was disregarded. The advice from Martyn Goddard, who is a health analyst, was summarily disregarded. So, too, was the work of John Lawrence and Graham Wells. Again and again, this government seems to cherry-pick advice. From this morning's interview with Saul Eslake on the radio, he does not have any terms of reference as yet and there is no timeline. Good way to start to look at any sort of review.

In 2021, Ian Watt AO was asked to review the Tasmanian State Service. He reviewed that and the recommendations were taken on board by the government. They are moving through that. It is a bit like just reinforcing that red tape. Here we have a review of the State Service to make it more efficient, and yet what are we seeing? We are seeing the government think about introducing some other major review. This is not good enough. It undermines the public service. It is not visionary. We need strong institutions. This is a sure-fire way to undermine those institutions.

Setting up the EPU, which was announced this morning by the Deputy Premier, minister Barnett - the EPU is the efficiency and productivity unit. It is there; it is another captain's call, by the Premier and Treasurer. It is a real sort of executive government, so you will not get a say in this at all if you are not the Premier nor Treasurer. The members will be appointed shortly.

This is a retrograde step by this government. It is an irresponsible step by this government and it is very poor fiscal management. We do not have a state of the state address which has been visionary. We have public servants who will be shaking in their boots.

Time expired.

[11.59 a.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, it is important to rise today and speak on this critical matter of public importance about the Rockliff government's privatisation agenda. What the Premier fails to point out every time he speaks up in recent days and recent weeks is that the government, his government, this Premier, have led this state to this position. The Liberal minority government have led Tasmania to a position where they believe they need to sell off valuable Tasmanian assets that look after and serve the Tasmanian people.

This government, over the last 11 years, have lost control of their financial management. They have lost control of their understanding of what it means to serve and lead Tasmanians. They have got themselves in such a mess that they have destroyed the budget, and now they are asking Tasmanians to pay. We know that right-sizing the public service - that is this government's, this is your public service that over the last 11 years you have had a capacity and a responsibility to look after, protect, and ensure that it serves Tasmanians. We know that the debt at the moment - this Liberal minority government have served across for 11 years and got ourselves in this financial situation despite alarm bells being rung. I can remember in the first weeks of being here, the fiscal sustainability report was released and it declared very clearly what had to happen and what this government needed to do to start correcting the mismanagement that they had been across for many years. 

We know that the state-owned companies and the GBEs have got to a point where some of them serve Tasmanians beautifully. Some of them are questionable in terms of losing their focus on acting in the best interests of Tasmanians. For the last 11 years, the Rockliff minority Liberal government has been responsible for ensuring that they do act in Tasmania's best interests. We know that the red tape that has been built up and laid on and has made it more difficult for Tasmanian businesses, Tasmanian individuals, Tasmanians or people outside Tasmania who are looking to come and invest in Tasmania. You guys have made it harder every year for 11 years.

This morning it was amazing. The government, the Premier, stands up and says, 'We want to create an environment where people want to invest'. I think he used the words 'are inducive to investment'. You have been the leaders of this state for 11 years and we know that people are being turned away. There is money that could be invested in Tasmania to protect us from your privatisation agenda. The Tasmanian economy would actually be thriving but you get in the way and you stop opportunities for investment.

I needed to explain this when I was talking last night to my family about what was happening in the state and what this meant. In simplest terms, when I was explaining it to my young son, I said, 'You imagine in our home we have some debt. We might have reasonably built up some debt, because not all debt is bad, but we might have been out of control for a little while. We have some things in our household that we could sell. They are important to us, they serve us well, but maybe we might need to sell them'.

The Premier says he wants to set up a future fund. He says that he wants to secure the future of Tasmania. At one point this morning he called it the 'sovereign wealth fund'. Then he said, actually, we are just going to sell stuff to put in a fund momentarily then to pay off debt. 

In a home, just say any home in Tasmania, you have a bike that you ride to work. You might have a couch that you enjoy at night time to sit on as a family, but you might have some debt on a credit card. You sell your bike and you pay off your credit card. You have nothing. You cannot get to work anymore to earn your wages. You sell your couch and you pay off your debt. You cannot sit around as a family anymore and enjoy your afternoons together.

Selling things off in Tasmania to put into a future fund, a 'sovereign wealth fund' - I would question the Premier if he actually understands what the definition of that is. I would like the Premier to put on record a definition of what he wants his future fund to be, when in the next breath he says it is just to pay down debt. Tasmania is not served by selling our valuable assets to pay off debt and be left with nothing better to do.

Year on year we have entities, organisations, and authorities in Tasmania that generate revenue for us to invest in our futures. That happens now. You erode that, you sell that off, you are undermining the future and the contributions that our Tasmanian assets can make to our Tasmanian community and economy. It is short-sighted. We know the outcomes of privatisation is always increased cost. It has always decreased services and eroded assets. It does not serve Tasmania into the future.

[12.04 p.m.]
Mr WOOD (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, as part of the of the government's 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future, the highest priority of this government is indeed growing our economy and creating opportunities for further job growth. Government-owned businesses are important Tasmanian assets. We will be progressing the first lot of solid changes and reforms for our GBEs and state-owned companies (SOCs). As the Premier has made very clear, we will also be looking at what businesses the government should own on the basis that the government, wherever possible, should not compete with an efficient private sector. We said last year that we are open-minded about the possibility of divestment of government businesses and other assets, but only if it is in the best interests of Tasmanians. 

The key question is why the government should own a business when there is not an overwhelming public benefit in doing so? We have also said very loud and clear that Hydro will always remain in public ownership.

We have proposed to merge TT-Line, TasPorts and TasRail into a unified government-owned entity for a strategic long-term approach to managing Tasmania's critical infrastructure. We will also be undertaking a detailed assessment of the benefits of moving several entities out of government ownership. That assessment will include things like community service obligations, cost of living considerations, like ensuring things such as car registration and energy costs remain the lowest in the country and whether our entities would do a better job without the shackles of government.

The Premier has been crystal clear. We will only divest if it is in the best interests of Tasmanians. Last year, we said that as part of our government business reform process we would define a principles-based approach for government's ownership of businesses, including the development of a government business ownership policy. We said each government business would be individually assessed, including consideration of whether it is operating within the most appropriate operating model or if it should be considered for divestment. 

Why should not we explore those options? Tasmania has a significant asset base and we recognise the important economic and social benefits that these assets provide. Paying down debt through sensible divestment of assets to help pave a sensible pathway to surplus makes good sense.

This is a sensible review of our government business enterprises. Our commitment is to fix our GBEs and to review our GBE portfolio to ensure that our GBE portfolio is put to work in a way that is in Tasmania's long-term interests. Retaining Hydro is undoubtedly in Tasmania's long-term interests, which is why we have ruled the sale of it out. The value in other GBEs is less obvious compared to Hydro, which is why we are undertaking the review.

If the numbers do not stack up, or if it is taking more than it is giving, then we will consider what options we have. Labor is quick to complain about the debt-incurred response to COVID-19 and implementing the recommendation, but they offer no solution for alternatives.

Members interjecting.

Mr WOOD - They also say we are not spending enough when it suits them to say so. 

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order. 

Mr WOOD - If they oppose rebalancing the state sector, oppose divestments of assets, they are left with one choice: to impose higher taxes on Tasmania. 

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order. I remind Mr Willie that I believe he is still warned. 
Mr WOOD - Our plan is to use our GBEs in a way that maximises their value to our state. We have seen recently from our GBEs that we cannot always sit back and watch. We need to get on the front foot and that is precisely what we are doing. What we are doing is sensible, measured, considered and appropriate.

Deputy Speaker, the government owned business portfolios are significant contributors to our economy and employ thousands of Tasmanians. That is why the government is undertaking reform of the government's arrangements for government businesses to improve transparency, accountability and efficiency. We are taking a holistic approach to the proposed reforms to ensure a more integrated cost effective, responsive and transparent team Tasmania outcomes.

PREMIER'S ADDRESS

Motion to Note

Resumed from 4 March 2025 (page 48).

[12.10 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - Deputy Speaker, I would like to start - in fact, no, I will not start because the new member for Lyons I was about to welcome has not arrived yet, so perhaps I will come back to it. 

Mr Barnett - Where is he?

Mr WINTER - It is his first day, Deputy Premier, so I will give him -

Yesterday's state of the state may as well have been pitched from an alternative universe: a universe where the Premier had not been part of a Liberal government for the last 11 years, where he had not created the problems that he had seemingly just discovered: massive debt, record deficits and a business environment that makes it too hard to build things or start a new business.

I have been reflecting on the speech since yesterday afternoon and on Liberal governments in Tasmanian history, and history is repeating itself. A minority Liberal government just like we had in 1998. A minority Liberal government that has run out of money, just like we had in 1998. A minority Liberal government that has run out of money and is now selling off state assets to try and cover up their mess just like we had in 1998.

A desperate, tired, minority Liberal government that cannot manage money and which has the wrong plan for the future of this state. It is a plan to sell Tasmania's future, just like we had in 1998. They have lost their majority and the Premier has lost his authority. They have lost their budget discipline, which means they have nothing left. They have lost touch with the Tasmanian people, they have broken their promise to not govern in minority, they have broken the state budget and they have broken the promises they made to Tasmanians. They have broken what little trust they had left.

After 11 years of the Liberals, there is no-one else left to blame. After they inherited zero net debt in 2014, there is no-one else left to blame. After finally admitting they trashed Tasmania's finances, there is no-one else left to blame. No-one for Tasmanians to blame but Jeremy Rockliff and this minority Liberal government.

Tasmanians do have a choice: a minority Liberal government that is tired, incompetent and desperate after 11 years in office, or a renewed Labor Party with a new member here today and a party that has changed under my leadership.

I would like to acknowledge the slightly late member for Lyons at this point in time, Mr Casey Farrell. We are incredibly excited to have Casey joining our team and this parliament. I have known Casey for about 10 years or so. He was running Startup Tasmania when I was running Tasmania ICT. Back then we chatted about the emerging digital trends around Airbnb and Uber and all the impacts that might have on society, business and the Tasmanian economy. Over the course of those discussions, we started talking a little bit about politics and realised we had a few things in common. 

You may have heard today, around the building, the cheer that arrived when he walked into our caucus. That is the level of excitement that we have. It is like anything in life, whether it is a football team, a community organisation or a parliamentary team, renewal is always good. Getting new ideas, new energy into our team is fantastic. I know that Casey is going to bring all of those things and we cannot wait to see what you contribute to this parliament and to our movement over the course of the next little while.

The Liberal minority government has proven that they cannot be trusted with the finances or with major infrastructure projects. The Labor Party does have a proven track record of paying off Liberal debt and building on big projects that drive our state forward. A minority Liberal government has lost touch with Tasmanians, whereas the Tasmanian Labor Party is back squarely at the political centre of our state.

We are back as the party of jobs and economic development. We are back in the business of building things. We are backing development, backing business, backing workers every single day. We will never ever back the privatisation of our critical energy assets, car registration or public transport.

This is a fundamental issue for the Labor Party. It is who we are. We will never support the agenda that the Premier announced yesterday. Like the great Jim Bacon, we will never support a reckless agenda to bail out a failing Liberal government. We definitely will not be backing privatisation when its only purpose is to cover up the mess that Jeremy Rockliff and the Liberals have made of the state's finances. It is not like they are doing this to build something better for the state. They are doing it to bail themselves out of the budget mess that they have created through waste and mismanagement.

That is not what public assets are for. Tasmania did not invest in renewable energy for 100 years so they could bail out the Liberal Party in 2025. We invested in these businesses to create jobs, to keep prices down, and to help pay for our schools and hospitals. These are our assets, the assets of Tasmanians. They are not Jeremy Rockliff's to sell.
Some of our greatest Tasmanian premiers, like Cosgrove and Reece, built assets that were so great that they are still helping to pay for our health and education systems today. We are not going to let them get away with selling them for a short-term sugar hit. We are not going to let them sell Tasmania's future.

Privatisation has not worked. The privatisation experiment in electricity has demonstrably failed on almost every measure, with consumers experiencing higher prices, lower reliability, and lower customer service. The privatisation of electricity assets in Australia has shown to have led to higher power prices for consumers. Since the assets were privatised in Victoria in the 1990s, power prices have increased by 170 per cent. Productivity has also declined. Since 1995, productivity in electricity, gas and water declined by 25 per cent, while all other Australian industries saw increases of 34 per cent. 

Privatisation has also led to increase in managers at the expense of engineers and actual tradespeople. The number of managers in the electricity sector has increased by a staggering 217 per cent since 1997, 10 times more than the number of technicians and trades workers. Private ownership creates an incentive for utility owners to over-invest in capex so that they can pass on the cost to consumers and get a bigger return. That is what happens.

The announcement yesterday from the Premier was reckless. It will hurt investor confidence and there are significant risks to the private sector. The Premier only needs to travel to Bell Bay where there are significant pressures on our major industrials who are already under incredible stress from the highest energy bills they have ever paid, and logistical and financial challenges across their businesses. They do not need this. He is putting their proud history in Tasmania at risk. He is selling Tasmania's future. There is no doubt that asset sales are now on the cards over there. They want to do it. They believe in it. It is in their DNA.

The Premier, who spoke at length yesterday, also spoke about red tape. The absurdity that this Premier is going to go back to the world with a slogan of, 'Fairer, faster, cheaper and simpler'. Of all things I thought I would hear yesterday, it was like I was in a time warp. This should not be lost on anyone in this place. This is the signature policy of the 2014 Liberals that they never, ever implemented. There is still no single statewide planning scheme today, 11 years later. Councils that we talked to that have implemented the new scheme say it is harder than ever to build a home. They have had to put on more planners to deal with the red tape that has been added by this Liberal government. Yesterday, we had the Premier of Tasmania arrive back in this place and use the same slogan and empty rhetoric that he used in 2014.

The Premier yesterday claimed that it takes 37 licences to open a cafe in Tasmania. He discovered this, he says, not by speaking to anyone in hospitality at a cafe or in a small business, but by reading the Business Council of Australia report. The claim in his speech was that after 23 years in parliament, 11 of those in government, the Premier of Tasmania has now discovered that there are 37 licences required to open a cafe. Just think about that for a minute. If it is true, who does he think is responsible for it? What on earth has their red tape reduction coordinator or Coordinator-General been doing for 11 years? What message did he send to young Tasmanians thinking about opening a new business? Is he saying, 'Do not bother, it is too hard'? That is what it sounded like yesterday.

Most of these regulations sit within the scope of local government. I have lost count of the number of times they have announced new reform attempts on local government over the course of the last 11 years for absolutely zero change. What are they actually going to do about it? How could anyone trust them to fix these things?

This is a mess that the Premier has made. A deficit handed down last year was more than $1.5 billion - nearly five times worse than the deficit at the height of COVID, a time when money was basically being shovelled out the door: more than a billion dollars worse than what it was  until then, the biggest budget deficit on record. This year it looks like it will be just as bad. There is $1.3 billion in the red so far and counting. We only have the figures until December but it is already a billion dollars worse than at the height of COVID. Tasmania is actually going to get $50 million more in GST than expected this year, but the problem is they have already spent it 10 times over. This level of deficit spending is completely unsustainable. There is no pandemic, there is no global financial crisis, just a minority Liberal government that has been in office for 11 years.

Tasmania needs change. Tasmania's credit outlook has been downgraded to negative by both major agencies, with a full rating downgrade now well and truly on the cards. It is not just those independent voices sounding the alarm. Saul Eslake has shown that Tasmania's finances are now the worst of any state in the country, worse than the Northern Territory, and worse than Victoria - a state they used to mock only two years ago.  Saul Eslake said:

This mess is entirely attributable to the actions and decisions of this Liberal government. 

The Liberals have no-one to blame but themselves. They have no-one to blame for the decisions like spending $7.2 million on a northern prison that was never built; millions gifted to public servants suspended as a result of the most heinous allegations; hundreds of thousands of dollars gifted to their own ministers who chose to start their own legal action, against all precedent and the guidelines; $22 million on traffic gantries that do not turn on; $39 million in advertising and self-promotion just last year, including tens of thousands of dollars on advertisements claiming they were fast-tracking the wharf at the Spirit of Tasmania; $65 million on consultants just last year, $40 million more than budgeted; $46 million on travelling, including the Coordinator-General's five-star hotels. All up there is more than a billion dollars blown on consultants, advertising and travel over the past 10 years. There is more than $100 million on planning for Marinus, which is years behind schedule and may not get built at all if you listen to some of the commentary from the former treasurer.

For the completely avoidable energy crisis that was caused when they almost blacked out the state, $180 million; $11 million for three hydrogen buses which they cannot operate because they have no hydrogen; $50 million for a Hydrogen Action Plan, where they said we would be making hydrogen by now, but there is still no power or water to actually turn it on; $3 million on local government reform that was abandoned before it even issued its report; a Spirit of Tasmania project which is the biggest stuff-up in Tasmanian history and will be $500 million over budget and six years delayed by the time they are finally finished.

I could go on, honourable Speaker, but I think the point is clear: Tasmanians cannot afford this reckless and wasteful spending. 

Jeremy Rockliff's minority government has shown time and time again they cannot manage money. For the sake of Tasmania's future, Tasmania needs change. Where all this wasteful, reckless spending has led is $10 billion of debt - debt that will consume $500 million of borrowed public money in interest repayments every single year.

That is enough to double the number of teachers employed in our schools. Imagine what we could do for our education system and kids' futures with twice as many educators in our system. It is enough money to triple the budget for the state's overstretched emergency departments. Imagine what we could do for Tasmanian patients who are stuck waiting in hospitals, or what we could do to completely abolish payroll tax for every business and company. Imagine what we could do for jobs, business and investment at a time when our economy is slowing. Instead, we will be paying for the Liberals' massive debt with poorer schools, worsening health services and, potentially, higher taxes.

If Jeremy Rockliff gets his way with higher power bills, higher car regos and higher bus fares too, he wants to sell Tasmania's future to cover up his record debt. This will be the defining legacy of Jeremy Rockliff's minority government. The facts speak for themselves. This Premier cannot manage money. If you cannot manage the budget, you cannot lead our state.

When the Liberals first came into office in 2014, Tasmania had no debt at all. In fact, there was more than $200 million worth of net cash and investments in the bank. Our state finances were the healthiest in the nation. We had an AAA credit rating. After 11 years of Liberals, those days are gone, because this Premier and the Liberals cannot manage money.

I want to make sure I get this next bit exactly right. I will quote:

We have a responsibility to ensure we do not leave debt legacies for future
generations because we are too selfish to tighten our belts. Maintaining our lifestyle today at the expense of the next generation is intergenerational theft and selfishness writ large. The current debt levels all over the country are distressing and need to be addressed. This will require tough decisions for the genuine welfare of the next generations. 

Those are not my words. They are the words of the Leader of the House, Eric Abetz, just last year. He is talking about his own minority government, his own Premier, because he knows this legacy and the legacy of the Liberal Party will take decades to overcome because - how will Tasmanians be able to trust them again if they have racked up $10 billion of debt, when the Liberals tell them their only plan for the future is higher power prices, higher car registrations, higher bus fares, and they are selling off businesses that pay for our schools and our hospitals? 

Mark my words, I am going to make the Premier and the Liberal Party feel the economic damage that they have caused and inflicted on our state. They are wholly and solely responsible for this and they must be held accountable. On behalf of every young person in this state who will be working to pay back for their whole working lives, they must be held accountable. I will make sure they are held to account for every dollar that they have wasted and ensure that they cannot just run away from this mess by imposing higher power prices, higher car registrations, and higher bus fares on every Tasmanian family and business. 

The truth is that you can no longer be trusted with the budget, which means you can no longer be trusted to lead our state. Tasmania needs change and Tasmanians have been here before. They have seen a minority Liberal government drive this state into record debt. They have seen a Liberal Premier try to clean up his mess by selling off our most valuable assets. They have seen them try and put up power prices for families and businesses and rob future generations of the revenue our assets generate. 

In times like these, Tasmanians know that voting for the Greens will not work. They know that voting for independents will just mean they get the Liberals again. They know that if they really want to change the government to stop the Liberals privatisation and change Tasmania for the better, then they need to elect a majority Labor government. 

Jim Bacon stood up to Liberals when they tried to sell the Hydro and I am going to stand up against their plans to sell everything else. Jim Bacon showed that by making our businesses more profitable, that was the way forward, not by selling them off. I am going to ensure that 100 years of investment in renewable energy helps to pay for our schools and hospital and police services for 100 years to come. Jim Bacon showed that a government that took budget management seriously could pay off every single cent that the Liberals had left. I am committed to treating this Liberal debt like a family treats its mortgage: something to be paid off carefully, methodically and steadily overtime. Most of all, Jim Bacon showed what a Premier with a vision could do with our state, for our state. An economy in a state's future could do with a turn around. That is why I am so determined to deliver that change Tasmania needs. 

I have said that Labor has changed under my leadership and I mean it. I have said that Labor stands for safe, secure, well paid jobs and I have started putting forward policies that prove it. I have said we need to be clear on what we stand for and when we support people, we should be proud of it. On my first day as Leader, I went straight to the west coast to show my support for the industry and the workers there. We went out on the water at Macquarie Harbour and spent the evening at Hamer's Bar with the workers whose livelihoods and communities and children's futures depended on that local industry. I promised them that I will do everything I could to protect their jobs and set about doing exactly that. 

I went to Canberra with our Deputy Leader, Anita Dow, took members of industry to meet with some of the most powerful political officers in the country and I could not be happier to see that work pay off. The Prime Minister's announcement that he would legislate to protect the west coast industry was celebrated by industry and Mayor Pitt, even if some on the other side seemed disappointed. It is a message that Labor stands for regional jobs in aquaculture, mining and native forestry in this state, and we always will. It is a message delivered also by our Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, who got it done for those west coast workers. He promised them he would fix it and he did.

The west coast is where I am from and it is where the Tasmanian Labor Party is from. We were born there 120 years ago. Our party exists to support working people and we are not going to take a backwards step on that mission. I know some people will not agree with me and that is fine. I can guarantee that Tasmanians will know exactly where we stand and this is what they will see us continuing to do; fighting for those regional industries like mining, renewable energy, every single day. Labor succeeded last year in legislating industrial manslaughter legislation through this parliament. It was a reform for safer workplaces that was the culmination of decades of work from advocates who had experienced the most unimaginable personal tragedy. We worked with unions and we got it done. 

Under my leadership, Labor stands for safe, secure, well paid jobs and we are the party that will always support working people and their families. We also announced a plan to slash red tape to get $25 billion worth of stalled investment moving by creating and supercharging the Coordinator-General. We announced that we will give it the power to coordinate environmental assessments, apply zoning changes and direct government businesses to support, not block.

Supporting investment and creating jobs will be at the centre of a Labor government's mission because that is how we deliver the change Tasmania needs. I have also announced policies to rebuild Tasmania's nightlife and create more jobs in our night time economy. We have announced plans to cut red tape and regulation for night time venues, outdoor dining and events.

It did not take me 23 years to work out that there is too much red tape in our hospitality sector. I spoke to the operators who told me exactly what it is like and we outlined our plan within six months of those conversations. Late last year, a business told me that they were unable to sell Boags or Cascades because they were not Tasmanian; completely absurd, unTasmanian. We have set out to overhaul these ridiculous restrictions being placed on Tasmanian businesses by an out of control licencing branch. 

If the Premier wants a place to start with his so-called red tape plan, perhaps he could start there. We put forward a plan to support live music and a night time economy, to protect existing venues from noise complaints, and we outlined a plan, as Labor governments always will, to support night time economy workers with a plan for better public transport and safety.

Not everyone was a fan of this policy, especially in the city of Hobart, but we need to take big steps to make Tasmania a great place for young people to choose to stay and to come to from all over Australia because, when 6000 Tasmanians have lost their jobs under this Liberal minority government, when young people are leaving for the mainland in record numbers, I believe we need to do something about it. We need to create jobs and deliver the change that Tasmania needs. 

People say that I am pro-development and they are right. Under my leadership, Labor is back in the business of building things and I put forward policies to prove it. Last year, we announced we will be backing an AFL stadium and an AFL team and the thousands of jobs that project will support. I can see huge opportunities for this project to deliver for our construction industry, for our tourism sector and for the business sector, and the vibrancy of our capital city and for the whole state.

We called on the government to develop a local jobs plan to make sure as much of this work goes to Tasmanians as possible. To unite Tasmanians, this project needs to deliver, on the ground, the promise of local jobs and more apprenticeships. A fly-in, fly-out workforce will not cut it. This is a huge project for our state and we cannot afford for it to go the same way as the Spirits.

We also announced our unequivocal support for the University of Tasmania's move into the Hobart City, their plans to build a $500 million science and technology centre and a plan to build 2000 new homes on their vacant land. It is the biggest building project Tasmania has seen in a generation and we have backed it all the way. We stood up to the reckless policy from the Liberals and the Greens to block it. We oppose their plan that would have sentenced Tasmania to a 20th century university education in an environment that demands 21st century learning. Not everyone agreed with us, but we put Tasmania's future first and we won. 

Renewal energy projects are big construction projects. A big part of my vision for the future of Tasmania is to give those opportunities that are currently before us. Not just how much we can get from selling off the assets, but from building more assets, we can drive even more investment so that the developments that have powered this state for 100 years can continue to drive our economy for 100 years more. 

Under the Liberals, major businesses are being turned away from our state because there is simply not enough power for them to operate. Robbins Island has spent eight years dealing with planning and environmental approvals. It took Whaleback Ridge four years to get permission to get into a development process and more than a year after the Liberals announced it is a major project, the proponent is still stuck trying to access the site. No progress has been made on offshore wind or the infrastructure needed to support it and there is no clarity about the North West Transmission Developments. 

The key to it all, Marinus Link, is delayed for reasons that the government cannot explain or just refuses to say. In Tasmania, more than anywhere else in this country, energy is the economy. That is why we have announced a policy to hand ownership of Marinus to the federal government to get Tasmania out of the way, and that is why we have announced a plan to bring forward planning work for port upgrades at Bell Bay so the next opportunity in the offshore is not delayed or squandered like the rest of the projects that have been put forward over recent years. 

Labor is the party that built the Hydro. We stopped the Liberals from selling it. We delivered Basslink. We built the gas pipeline. We built the nation's first wind farms. It has always been Labor that delivers on new renewable energy assets and it always will be. We will be the ones that deliver change and an ambitious renewable energy development once again.

I have also guaranteed Tasmanians that a Labor government I lead will always be responsible with the state's finances. That includes ruling out new taxes. I am going to say that again - ruling out new taxes, like we did last year following the Eslake report. Instead, we proposed a wholesale reform of Tasmania's government businesses to focus them on Tasmania's economic interests to sharpen their management and to ensure they have proper oversight, which they have not had. Reforming our government businesses, making them more profitable, increasing returns to Tasmania is how we fix this budget - not selling off the businesses that Tasmania worked so hard to build.

I announced 10 policies to get started on the difficult work of budget repair. I said we would cut waste by axing consultants, terminating outsourced contracts that do not deliver value for money, banning pork-barrelling to stop taxpayers being ripped off, and tasking Treasury with identifying and ending failed programs, something adopted by the Premier today. I have announced we will improve budget transparency by including a 10-year projection for debt and deficits in every budget as Saul Eslake recommended, and establishing independent Parliamentary Budget Office.

I have announced we will drive efficiency by sharing more services across agencies to reduce duplication, introducing performance-based budgeting that links government spending to measurable outcomes, and merging generic ICT infrastructure to reduce maintenance costs, strengthen buying power and improve cyber security.

Unlike the Premier, I have committed to allocating every single cent saved through these initiatives to paying down debt, as should happen. I have been upfront about these budget repair policies, that they are only the first steps, the things we will do on day one to start repairing the enormous mess left by these Liberals. I know their debt is too big, and their deficit is too out of control to be fixed overnight. It has taken 11 years for Liberals to get us into this situation, and it will take just as long to get us out.

We will treat their record debt like a family treats its mortgage - something to be paid down carefully, methodically and steadily over time. Over the course of the next year, our team will unveil one of the most comprehensive policy packages any opposition has put forward in decades. Over the course of the next year, we will do that by working with businesses, working with workers, the workforce and across our community. We are going to give Tasmanians a real choice: a choice of more debt, bigger deficits, credit downgrades, and privatisation under Liberals, a plan to sell Tasmania's future, or an ambitious plan to deliver the change Tasmania needs to create jobs, to grow the economy, to back development and get Tasmania building again. To govern this state with responsible budget management, Tasmanians need to vote for Labor.

Under my leadership the Labor Party has listened. We have changed. We are back as the party of jobs and economic development. We are back in the business of building things. We are proudly pro-development, pro-business, and we are pro-worker. We are the party of responsible financial management in Tasmanian politics today.

The Liberals, in contrast, have run out of road. After 11 years in office, they have run out of good ideas and the ability to get things done. They have shredded their credibility through stuff-ups, particularly with the Spirits. They forfeited their right to govern this state through disastrous mismanagement of Tasmania's finances. Their only plan for the future is to privatise our assets and put up the price of power, car registration, and bus fares.

In their place, I offer Tasmanians new leadership. I offer a new Labor Party, particularly today with Mr Farrell joining us, a plan with a vision for the future, and a plan to deliver the change that Tasmania needs.

Members - Hear, hear.

The SPEAKER - I did not want to interrupt the member while he was speaking as these are significant responses. All members know they are not allowed to drink coffee in the Chamber. The next person who does it will leave the Chamber for the entire day.

[12.40 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, this is Muwinina land. It was stolen in a violent dispossession and those people are no longer with us today. I pay my respects on behalf of the Greens and acknowledge that today's proud and strong Aboriginal people, the Palawa Pakana, live on as custodians of this island. They continue the practices, the hopes and wisdom of a community that is tens of thousands of years old.

We have so much to learn about courage, persistence and caring for country. The Greens stand with Tasmanian Aboriginal people in their demands for justice from a colonising government that has never yet enacted the treaty that was promised. We stand with them in their demands for laws that protect country, their heritage and living landscape shaped by hundreds of generations. We applaud the strength and leadership of Uncle Jim-puralia meenamatta, Ruth Langford and others arrested for defending the ancient forests of Lutruwita from the Liberals' destruction.

As Uncle Jim said, 'First Nations law is in country and we are obligated to defend our law because we are country and country is us'. We stand with them, his people and the many others appalled at the destruction of land, sea and sky country. We commit to working for truth telling of our collective history, the return of lands, and a treaty.

When we arrived back here yesterday, it felt like we had never left this place for the summer break, despite the resignations, the changed seating, portfolios, and beards that had grown. That all changed with the Premier's speech. It was channelled from the hard right agenda, the likes of Thatcher, Reagan and now Trump. When the Premier said yesterday, 'To govern with a heart you need a strong economy', he has forgotten that to govern with a heart you actually need to have a heart.

What we saw was a Premier - in the shortest speech in recent memory for a state of the state speech - reading words with no conviction, making promises that will cut to the hearts of poor and vulnerable Tasmanians who are looking at losing essential services they desperately depend on.

The state of the state is usually where we see Premiers outline their positive vision for the year ahead. Instead, Jeremy Rockliff used it to officially announce his government's huge lurch to the political right. Jeremy Rockliff might be Premier in name, but his speech yesterday spelled out that it is Eric Abetz, Guy Barnett and their radical right-wing friends in Cabinet that are now pulling the strings in the Tasmanian Cabinet.

The Premier announced cuts to the public sector, privatisation of public services and assets, and giving corporations and industry free reign. This is straight out of the neo-conservative playbook. We have been watching this play out in countries around the world for over 50 years.

The Premier was so shameless in his ideological shift that he happily directly referenced Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump's language when he said people want government out of their lives. Well, it is not true. Tasmanians want an ambulance when they need it. They want a safe and secure place to call home. They want a reliable bus service. They want schools that give every child the chance of a bright future.

The Premier had the gall to say that he is leading a government with heart. Nothing can be further from the truth. In his distorted view of the world, he is trying to persuade us that you have to be cruel to be kind. We do not buy it. This is all about a destructive right-wing agenda and a red carpet for corporations and the Liberals' special interests. What he is proposing is to flog off critical government businesses, even to reach in with a mighty steel claw and privatise parts of government itself like the Lands Office. He has not told us where it will end. When the Premier says he is going to sell off the farm to deliver better quality public services, we say electricity at a fair price is service, we say access to buses is an essential service. There is no guarantee that any of those services will exist under privatisation for businesses that operate for profit. 

It is a classic sign of a Liberal government on the rocks, after more than a decade of election pork-barrelling, disastrous economic management and sweet deals for mates. The Greens are fundamentally opposed to the disturbing agenda that the Liberals laid out yesterday. We will be fighting tooth and nail to make sure they do not get their way. We are standing strongly with workers, with unions and Tasmanians who care about this place and who will resist this move.

The Premier pulled out some of his favourite old clichés yesterday. According to him, it is just red tape that is stopping Tasmania from being his wonderland. He said this so many times it sounds like he has believed his own dishonesty. Where did he talk about the reality for Tasmanians, of record hospital wait times, of homelessness, of the extinction of species? What about the ravages of climate change that we are seeing more and more?

They were the wooden talking points of a Premier who has forgotten who he is meant to be speaking for: the many people who are struggling to pay their bills - that is, if they are lucky enough to have an affordable, secure home. Those Tasmanians who are anxious about the basics of everyday life: these people are not dreaming about champagne flowing in the corporate boxes at Jeremy Rockliff's billion-dollar-plus stadium.

We know that Tasmanian hospitals remain desperately under-funded. Every day this has real-life impacts. People are waiting longer than everyone else in the country for an ambulance. The length of time people sit in an emergency room is still getting longer.

The cost of living is hurting households and driving small businesses to the wall. The price of everything that we know is going up: bills, groceries, rents, buildings. These are all facts. If the Liberals were really prioritising Tasmanians who are struggling, we know there is so much more that they could be doing and that they could have been doing for the last decade. 

Step 1: they can make everyday public services, education and public transport truly free. It is such a small cost to the overall budget that would make such a massive difference to some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in our community.

Step 2: they would pull all the levers that they can pull at the state level to help Tasmanians get an affordable and secure home. Housing is a fundamental human right but finding a home that does not break the bank is now one of the biggest stresses for the majority of Tasmanians. Liberals have sat on their hands for years while thousands and thousands of rental homes have been converted to Airbnbs. They stood by and watched rent prices go through the roof and saw rental supply crash. It was all forewarned. They stood by and watched. The party closest to the developers has done nothing to stop that even when there is a planning fix. So much for having a heart.

Lutruwita/Tasmania still has some of the weakest rental protection laws in the countries. Renters can still be evicted without cause. Our minimum rental household standards are callously basic. It is a shame. It is an outrage that the Liberals have knowingly done nothing about this. On top of this, they have failed year on year to build the homes that they promised the people who desperately need them. They will not muster the will and energy to build homes. Instead they are using the full force of government departments right now and many high-paid consultants to bulldoze through a billion-dollar stadium project. It says everything about their warped priorities. 

Instead of fixing the real blockages to the housing crisis, the Rockliff Liberals are now claiming they need to reform the planning system as if that is what is holding back progress. Let us call that for what it is. It is cynical. It is self-interested. They are giving party-donor developers what they want and not doing what is actually needed to build homes. If they were serious, we would expect to see in here legislative rights for renters, a rein-in for short-stay accommodation, building more public and social housing and dropping their focus on a billion-dollar stadium. The community does not want it, they do not need it, and we cannot afford it.

In case you are Zooming in from Mars and this needs to be spelled out, the reason that the Liberals are not putting the needs of Tasmania first is because they are wholly focused on what their corporate mates want. We saw this so clearly with their pokies backflip. Tasmanians put tens of millions through the poker machines every year. Those parasitic machines are rigged to give money to gambling corporations. They destroy lives and livelihoods and they break up families. Despite all that, Jeremy Rockliff chose to put the pokies lobby first. He betrayed all Tasmanians by breaking his promise to introduce the pokies mandatory pre-commitment card. The slightest pressure from the gambling industry and any help that was to be there for problem gamblers has evaporated. We saw exactly the same thing from Labor in the 2018 election. We know who is pulling the strings of both these major party puppets. 

For decades it has been both the Liberal and Labor politicians, many decades now in Tasmania, who have worked separately and together to put the interests of these big businesses above the long-term and short-term interests of Tasmanians and above protecting our environment. Millions of dollars in secret donations have flown to both parties. How much of those vast sums has come from the gambling industry or from developers or multinational corporations like big salmon or healthcare organisations? What is the quid pro quo? What have Tasmanians paid the price for?

Pokies are an obvious, glaring, brutal example, but the payouts obviously do not end there. Last year, the Liberals rammed through special legislation that enabled their developer donor, Tipalea, to bypass the state's planning laws. It is a pretty clear picture: developer wants something; developer donates money to the Liberals; developer gets what they want. Job done.

We desperately need a stronger Integrity Commission now more than ever. It is not a later issue. We have to urgently clean up politics and make all politicians accountable to the people who elect them, not to wealthy donors and vested interests.

The Greens are doing what we can. Last year we passed through this bill to ensure that all donations over $1000 are made transparently to the public. It is a good start. I can assure you that we are not going to stop there.

I cannot talk about the state of our beautiful island without mentioning the fires that torched almost 100,000 hectares over the summer. They put lives and properties at risk. They destroyed Aboriginal heritage. They devastated the magnificent rainforests of Takayna and east of there. The damage that has occurred now to some of Earth's irreplaceable natural values, especially to our ancient pines, has shocked and saddened many Tasmanians. The Greens offer our deepest thanks to everyone who worked and continue to work so hard to fight the fires and protect communities and our globally unique environment. Many of these people were volunteers and there obviously needs to be a dramatic investment in early prevention of fire. This is not something that can be subjected to a job recruitment freeze.

The fires are a terrible reminder for us all that climate change is starting to bite. It is already bringing us fear and heartbreak. This is an emergency. Tasmanians have raised their voices loud and clear. I especially pay my deep respects and acknowledge the work of young people in Tasmania who have fought so hard and raised their voices about the frightening state of the climate future that is ahead of us, indeed that we are seeing today. They want the Liberals to take real climate action now and do what we can before things get worse for us all and for future generations.

Instead of taking the ambitious action that we have to take, the Liberals are now peddling climate denial and greenwashing. They are trading in false solutions and incrementalism. They have refused to rein in the emissions of corporations. Business as usual with big emissions flowing is continuing. They have refused to work with and substantially invest in local communities and council to help planning for the increasing climate threats that are coming fast.

We have to have the ruggedising of impacts on infrastructure and communities that will inevitably come from stronger and more repeated extreme events. The Liberals are especially ignoring the big climate elephant in the room - our glorious carbon-storing native forests with globally significant tall trees are those that they are continuing to log and burn. Other states and territories have got the message. We are in a climate and biodiversity emergency and they have banned native forest logging and there is no time to waste. The Greens stand with the communities of future-minded Tasmanians and with everyone in our forest today who is putting their heart and body on the line to protect us and the forests from destruction - to stop the millions of tonnes of emissions a year that go into the atmosphere and heat it up from Forestry Tasmania's logging and burning of native forests.

This is what real climate action looks like. The government has to end native forest logging today.

The Premier is content to flog off government businesses that operate in the public interest while he continues to support millions of subsidies to keep Forestry Tasmania afloat but instead of protecting the native forest, which other states in Australia have sensibly seen is a pathway for a safer future, the Liberals are planning to expand further into high-conservation value Future Potential Production Forest (FPPF) forests in the north-east, north and north-west. In a climate and biodiversity crisis, this is nothing but cooked. The news, I have to say, has been a galvanising force for local communities in those regions who are bewildered and outraged that the areas of local forests that they protected - some of them who formed local groups 25 years ago - are now threatened with being logged and burnt. They cannot believe it.

I have been and spoken to a number of those communities with other members of the Greens - members for Bass and Lyons - and what we hear are communities reforming groups, starting new groups, reaching out in communities, starting to have the public meetings, speaking up in outrage at what the Liberals are doing. They reject this move and communities will form and stand strong against it to fight it.

In recent weeks Tasmanians have been rightly disgusted at the animal cruelty of the aquaculture industry and seen hundreds of thousands of fish floating diseased and dead at the top of salmon pens. This is a toxic industry. It is polluting our waterways and now it is spewing up fatty chunks of dead salmon that are washing up on southern beaches. Swimmers have not been able to swim there because of the fishy stench from their bodies. 

The mixed messages from the EPA were very disturbing. They spoke of an Environment Protection Authority that does not have as its first and most clear priority to put the protection of the environment first. Were it that sort of organisation, we would have expected to hear all the facts about what is going on. However, what we have heard today is news that piscirickettsia is apparently the identified organism that has caused the disease in the salmon pens. That is very bad news if that is the case for the Tasmania salmon industry because it was that particular organism that caused the collapse of the whole Chilean salmon industry and has decimated other salmon industries around the world.

This shows this is one of the outcomes of having appallingly weak environmental laws because those environmental laws are not only bad for the marine environment, they are also ultimately bad for the industries themselves. When you rely on the marine environment, you are relying on having healthy functioning ecosystems. That is not what we have in our waters around Tasmania because of the EPA's and the Liberals' failure to rein in the big salmon industries that we know are major donors. 

Unlike the Premier, I will not ignore the state of the environment in this speech. After a decade of avoiding doing the work, the government finally released a State of the Environment Report last year. What a shocker it was and how appalling the government's response to that was. It shames them all. What the report shows is that the past decade of Liberal government has resulted in a serious and dramatic decline in Tasmania's natural environment. The report looked across all the themes of land, biodiversity, rivers and wetlands, air, waste, coast and marine. Most of the measures for those areas were shown to have a declining state in those essential parts of our environment.

I will focus particularly on the marine environment part of the report, which shows the deeply concerning pace of ocean heating that is happening. We are, unfortunately, in one of the hottest marine spots in the world.

Our average sea temperatures have increased 2.5 degrees from what was once called normal. Over the warm months, it can now be 3.8 degrees higher on average, so obviously the impacts of this are serious. I am sure we are all concerned -

PREMIER'S ADDRESS

Motion to Note

Resumed from above.

[2.30 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, the sea surface temperatures over the warm months off the shores of Tasmania can be 3.8°degrees or higher on average, and the impacts can be many and serious. Just this past summer we have seen an explosion of salps, bioluminescence across the south and the east, an explosion of moon jellyfish, and we have been told by eminent scientists that these are the direct results of the massive amount of nutrients going into our waters from fish farm aquaculture combined with hot oceans. The millions of dead fish that we have seen washing up on beaches and reported in fish pens is disturbingly and unfortunately unlikely to be the end of where we are at in Tasmania. 

We have been repeatedly warned by scientists this is a dangerous sign of an ocean ecosystem under pressure. It is at risk of flipping into a new site. Those are the signs of nature in distress which is exactly why the State of the Environment report made many urgent recommendations for actions to reverse the decline across not just our marine environment, but our environment across the whole of Lutruwita/Tasmania. The Greens urged the government to give top priority to addressing all the recommendations from this report. 

I will take a moment to reflect on the last year for the Greens. Our party has an amazing and proud history of achieving important outcomes for the state. It has been exciting to see how the current team of members, the new Greens members, has built on the legacy of the last 40 years of Greens in parliament. 

My Deputy Leader, Vica Bayley MP, the member for Clark, has shown himself to be a remarkable parliamentarian in addition to his history as a remarkable and outspoken voice for the community and for wild places. His scrutiny of the government's ill-advised Macquarie Point Stadium has been rigorous and detailed. He has passionately represented a range of stakeholders who have been let down by both the Liberals and Labor. He has worked hard on the massive issue of housing as a voice for renters and for people who cannot find a home. He has drawn on his long history in the conservation movement to be a powerful voice in this place for the environment and has played an important role on the Energy Committee as it undertakes its essential in-depth work about our collective futures. As leader of Greens business, Vica has been instrumental in working across this chamber on behalf of the Greens to achieve positive change for the community. 

After nearly two decades on Hobart City Council, Helen Burnet is the second Greens member for Clark and she has already shown the benefits in this place of her vast experience and wide-reaching community connections. Her work on behalf of Devarshi 'Dave' Deka and his family played a significant role in Dave being awarded permanent residency in Tasmania. She stood firmly against the self-appointed planning overlord, Felix Ellis, in his push to undermine proper process in every area it can be found. She has been working with unions to progress a much-needed portable long service leave scheme for key industries and she is now gearing up for the fight against the government's planned public service cuts. Helen has also pushed the government to take on important areas like tackling racism and road safety, helping to achieve real outcomes for her community and her voters like the recent speed limit reduction at Leith. 

Our member for Bass, Cecily Rosol, brought her experience of a life full of caring for people into the parliament. As a foster carer, Cecily was well-placed to take on the children and young people portfolio and she has been a relentless voice in this place for them. She has played an essential role in scrutinising the government's progress to respond to the commission of inquiry. She has continued to expose the weasel words and the excuse making we hear from the government on Ashley Youth Detention Centre and in child safety generally. In the hugely important health portfolio and as a former nurse, Cecily has been outspoken for health workers and patients, decrying the Liberals' devastating underinvestment in essential services and cuts. She has done a fantastic job of building relationships with stakeholders across all her portfolios and she is a wonderful local member, like the work she has done on behalf of the Beauty Point Caravan Park residents.

After a decade without a Greens member for Lyons, it was so good to see Tabatha Badger MP elected. Tabatha's collaborative strong work on the issue of family violence immediately once she started as an MP across the Chamber has been incredibly impressive. She was also responsible for taking through our bill to decriminalise begging that became law last year, which was, we would have to say, a rather complex process given the nature of this new parliament. Tabatha was known for her strong advocacy on behalf of Tasmania's wild places before she became an MP and she has shown her depth and breadth of knowledge of Tasmania's special protected places. She is doing a great job building the case for investment in future industries, including regenerative tourism and landscape restoration. I would also note that while all that has been going on, the film that Tabatha directed about Lake Pedder has been nominated for awards at not just one, but two, international film festivals.

Finally, our member for Hobart, the inimitable Cassy O'Connor MLC, the first Greens member for the Legislative Council and a previous member of this place for 14 years. She is a force of nature and for nature. It has been so wonderful to see Cassy in the Legislative Council become the oxygen-clear voice for all that we stand for as a party. Cassy holds the critically important role on the Integrity Committee, a position likely to become even more important given recent announcements from the government. As our justice spokesperson, she started a campaign for long overdue reforms to quad bike and all-terrain vehicle (ATV) laws. With the Liberal and Labor politicians both focused on cheerleading the racing industry, Cassy continues to be a strong voice for the horses and greyhounds that are abused, mistreated and neglected. That is just the beginning of our team and what we have been able to achieve in less than a year. We are very excited about the outcomes we can achieve in the year ahead.

The world is changing fast. Far-right and conservative thinking has been supercharged by Donald Trump's election. One of the most powerful men in the world is a narcissistic autocrat. His right-hand man, Elon Musk, is promoting fascist movements in Europe to destabilise their governments. The United States president has called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dictator and has changed the US into an illiberal superpower that backs Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a few short weeks, Trump has ruptured the 85-year alliance between Europe and the United States. This bodes very ill for Australia, given our dependence on the United States. A new chaotic world order is forming around us.

We are not immune here on our tiny island. It was a shocking lurch to the right that we saw from the Premier in his speech yesterday. It is more important than ever for us to stand strong and defend our democracy. The Greens will call out and fight the creeping manipulation and control of both Liberal and Labor politicians by big corporates. We see it already in those parties, the lockstep assault on the planning scheme with a development assistance, developer panels, the support for bespoke legislation to override laws for developer mates, and their backflips on pokies reforms. That is why we must have an Integrity Commission with teeth.

I can say I think we all understand that these times will test us. We have a choice to lead together and unite to protect the values of freedom, diversity, equity and inclusion, to stand against extreme right agendas that would tear down our public institutions and hollow out public services.

The Greens' focus will be to fight for Tasmanians who cannot afford to feed their families or find a home. We will be a voice for patients waiting in emergency rooms. We will be defending this island's wild places, our forests from loggers, our oceans and waters from the toxic salmon industry, and world heritage wilderness which we will look after for the planet, from privatisation. A key part is getting the dirty money and secret deals out of politics. We will do everything we can to do that. We will not be silenced or shut down, and neither will the communities we represent. We will prevail.

[2.40 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Deputy Premier) - Honourable Speaker, I am pleased and proud as Deputy Premier, Treasurer, Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, to say congratulations and well done to the Premier on an outstanding state of the state address, one which has been described by the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI) as, without doubt, the most ambitious reform-oriented state of the state speech in over 20 years. The TCCI supports what Premier Rockliff outlined today. 

It is very encouraging indeed, because we have, as part of our DNA in the Rockliff Liberal government, plans to back industry, back business, create jobs, and grow the economy. This was made very clear yesterday in terms of our plan, which is a long-term plan to grow the economy so that we can reinvest in those essential services of health, education, housing, and police.

It is important for us as a government to back in our communities. It is important for us, and, I know, the community, to recognise that we cannot reinvest in those essential services without a strong economy. That is what we are doing. That is what we have delivered and will continue to deliver, despite not only the lack of a plan, but the scare campaign plan from state Labor. It is incredibly disappointing that they cannot address the issues before us in this parliament in a measured and sensible way, dealing with each and every argument on its merits, rather than simply running for a scare campaign. No plan, relentless negativity.

It was informative that the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry called on state Labor to back in the Premier's plans for Tasmania. The TCCI 'calls on the Labor Party and the crossbench to back in these reforms'. We are very keen to work with our colleagues across this parliament to ensure that we get the best interests of Tasmania front and centre.

As Treasurer I am so pleased to have, just an hour or two ago, announced that our gross state product has hit yet another record. That is very encouraging news. The State Final Demand for December 2024 calendar year was $48.9 billion - a record 12 months for Tasmania. That is the strength of our economy. It does not just happen out of thin air. It is because we have policies that support and encourage business and industry to create jobs to grow the economy. It is because we have a growing economy that you can spend record funds into health and education and in those essential services. 

This is on the back of historically low unemployment, record retail spending, which again I announced in recent days. This is very encouraging news. The highest wage growth figures were announced just a few weeks ago. We are backing in the economy to get the job done.

I congratulate the Premier on delivering on this plan. This plan is in many parts, but includes slashing red tape, streamlining the processes to allow business - small, medium and large - to get on and do their job. As a government we create an environment in which business can do their job and prosper and grow. That supports all of us in Tasmania and across this great country. We now have more than 37,000 small businesses in Tasmania. They are the big employers, particularly in our rural and regional communities.

I recognise the Mayor of Tasman, Rod Macdonald, here today, and other members of the business and wider community. I thank them for being present for this very important address, and remarks with respect to the state of the state address by the Premier which was led by the Premier yesterday.

We are very pleased to be able to back in this plan. In terms of delivering on that plan, the Premier has said, 'Yes, we want to support business and industry. We want to make sweeping changes to red tape. We want to slash red tape'. There will be an audit of government programs to remove waste and an assessment of the suitability of divesting a number of government business enterprises. I make note that since our election last year, 1000 initiatives have been completed and are under way. We have set targets, we have met them, we have delivered. We will continue to deliver, to grow our economy, create more jobs, back business, back industry and deal with the cost-of-living pressures that Tasmanians absolutely are under at the moment - cost of living, and cost of doing business as well.

We are delivering record support in terms of concessions for vulnerable Tasmanians, in terms of electricity prices across Australia - having either the lowest or amongst the lowest electricity prices across all our jurisdictions - all our state jurisdictions across the country for regulated prices for both residential customers and small business.

On top of that there is the renewable energy dividend, which we as a government promised at the election. Guess what? We have delivered. We have delivered on that because we know cost of living is a top priority for Tasmanians.

In terms of cutting the unnecessary red tape and regulations, looking at government waste, I had the opportunity on behalf of our government to announce earlier today the establishment of an efficiency and productivity unit (EPU) to be part of the Department of Premier and Cabinet, reporting directly to the Premier and the Treasurer. This will ensure that we can focus across the state public service on efficient and effective services that are more productive through digital investments and through an assessment and audit by the EPU across the government programs - across those government services to make sure that it is fit for purpose, to make sure that the views and the priorities of the Tasmanian people are front and centre.

We want to make those services and those programs even better and more effective. Wherever there is government waste, we want to cut it back wherever possible. I am really looking forward to progressing that initiative.

I note that the Saul Eslake report and Saul Eslake, who I have spoken with in recent days, absolutely backs that in the merit of reviewing the efficiency and productivity of the government. Of course, that is important and we will do it; we will deliver on it.

In terms of the government business enterprise reform agenda, it is very clear that this is a priority of government. The Premier and I announced the release of the discussion paper last year. We got feedback on that - 48 submissions. We had roundtables, a reference group of business and industry representatives. A number of those were held prior to Christmas and on a number of occasions since then. That will be ongoing.

Likewise, there was a meeting with the chairs and the CEOs of the government business enterprises to ensure that we can get best practice governance in Tasmania. The reason I tabled just short of a 200-page draft bill for consultation yesterday for six weeks was to get that feedback, get that collaboration, and to deliver on our commitment of the first tranche of legislative reforms.

We said we would deliver that in the first quarter of this year and that is exactly what we have done. We have worked closely shoulder to shoulder with those business and industry groups. I am so pleased and proud to have delivered on that in terms of highlighting full disclosure of renewal of board directors and of ensuring key performance indicators are injected into the operations and activities of our government business enterprises.

It has been a great privilege and an honour to get that feedback from those involved and then working with Treasury and others to make that happen. I want to say thank you to all those who have been involved in the process and look forward to continuing to work with you. The second tranche of that reform agenda will be tabled or at least released for consultation around the middle of this year. We have an expert consultant delivering on views with respect to best practice for our government business enterprises in Tasmania. We are backing them. We will look forward to making that happen.

With respect to the government business enterprises in that discussion paper last November: when it was released it made it very clear it would consider divestment wherever appropriate and get feedback on that divestment of those government business enterprises. That is exactly what the Premier has announced and what we will be delivering on.

I am very pleased that Saul Eslake can lead that work and provide advice back to government. What is best for Tasmania? Surely, that is the key question when it comes to those government business enterprises.

Others in this place can have a view. We certainly welcome that, but we do not welcome scare campaigns by the opposition. The presentation by the Opposition Leader made it very clear that he rejected the Premier's state of the state plan for Tasmania, which is described by business as the most ambitious plan for Tasmania in decades. He rejected that. On the other hand, he supported making those GBEs more profitable. During this whole GBE process, all the feedback, comments and messages that are coming through are supportive of a team Tasmania approach. 
There is only one thing that state Labor has in terms of a plan and that is higher charges and higher costs for the Tasmanian people when it comes to bus fares, electricity prices and other consumer-related costs that would flow from forcing those GBEs to deliver increased profits. This was the message coming through since last year and before that - that we want a team Tasmania approach - to work together to do what is for Tasmania. This is part of Labor's secret plan, no doubt, to increase those costs across the board and that is very concerning.

There will be a very considered look at those GBEs in terms of what is relevant and those cost-benefit analyses; that advice will of course come back. There will be careful review and in due course it will come back to this parliament in terms of what is in the best interests of Tasmania. That is why we are backing that. This will be done in a very considered, measured, professional and wise way as we progress over the weeks and months ahead - as we progress these very significant reforms to grow our economy, create more jobs and deliver for the people of Tasmania.

We are backing the economy. We are backing the strengths that we have. For context, I can say, as Treasurer, this is on the back of COVID-19, where we saved lives, where we saved livelihoods. It was really hard. In terms of the budget, it was more than $2 billion of expenditure during that time. We had to do it. We did do it. We received support across the community for it.

Flowing from that, we had a commission of inquiry in terms of the child sex offences with respect to state government institutions. Guess what? Not only over the last few years, over the last 40 years-plus. Guess what? The responsibility is for us as a government to take on board that tragic, very sad and disappointing history and take it on board on behalf of all of us. That is a cost to the taxpayer of some billion dollars or more. In terms of the potential liability, there is $600 million we have allocated in the budget. 

This is important and we are coming off the back of that. There has been reference to the debt and the deficit. I have made it very clear that the debt is manageable. There is a whole range of data to confirm that.

We are now preparing the budget for 29 May 2025: my first budget for this year and for me as Treasurer. It will back a sustainable future. It will back our economy. It will back industry. I am looking forward to continuing to work with the relevant stakeholders and those within government to deliver on that.

We continue, as a government, to support our community with cost-of-living measures to support Tasmanians. I mentioned, earlier, the renewable energy dividend of $250 energy bill relief. What about the school lunches for the mums and dads and their kids, saving some $950 a year, the stamp duty for first home owners, some $29,000 that can be saved for homes up to $750,000? That is a big saving for a family. I have met many recipients and very happy young couples who have been part of that process and have benefited greatly. We continue to invest heavily in health and education. 

Regarding infrastructure, I commend Kerry Vincent, who is not here today, but his announcement just more than a week ago of a multi-billion dollar - a $30 billion - infrastructure pipeline over the years to come. This is injecting confidence, capacity and a plan for the future, because that is what we have. We have that infrastructure pipeline and as a government we have backed it in over the last 11 years: more than $6 billion in infrastructure. I can acknowledge the importance of that, whether it be the Bridgewater bridge - that is absolutely a ripper - I know Tasmanians are pleased and proud of that regarding roads and bridges.

Two fantastic new schools at Brighton and Legana were completed in recent weeks and months. I am so pleased and proud of that. Jo Palmer took a leadership role there and an innovative and professional approach, delivering for the people of Tasmania. Our Health minister, Jacquie Petrusma, is always at the frontline. She understands health and the health services that are required for the people of Tasmania. It is so encouraging to have somebody who is committed and respected in that space taking on that role. I know how challenging it can be as a former Health minister. 

I commend Felix Ellis with the champion effort he has to support planning, growth and development and progressing so positively, working with the relevant stakeholders, supporting our High-Vis Army together with the Premier and others. It is absolutely very encouraging indeed.

Madeleine Ogilvie, who is just a few metres away from me right now, regarding the innovation and the digital economy. She is such a flag waver for the important investment that we have every year to move us into a streamlined process to cut the red tape and make a big difference. 

To Roger Jaensch, likewise. His commitment; he has heart, he delivers, he cares, he is authentic and he is delivering. 

To Jane Howlett, likewise. Certainly, in the Primary Industries and Water space in particular, she is so committed. She is always out there supporting the local communities. To be standing there together to lock in that $350 million for the South East Irrigation Scheme is one of the highlights for me of the last quarter of this year, to be there with Peter Dutton and Susie Bauer. 

I want to do a bit of a shout out to Susie. She is a champion for the Lyons electorate. She will not give up. She is so determined and such a hard worker and I am totally convinced that you have been an excellent federal member for the Lyons electorate. I commend Susie and thank her for her commitment and her care to her community. The list absolutely goes on. 

Regarding the Premier, thank you for your leadership, and for what you have done for the people of Tasmania. We are very pleased and proud of that and we are backing you a 100 per cent. We know that you are providing that leadership that is so important. You are not doing a TikTok dance on the lawns of parliament House like the Leader for the Opposition was yesterday. You are taking it very seriously and getting the job done for the people of Tasmania.

Time expired. 

[3.00 p.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, Jeremy Rockliff and the Liberals have proven they cannot manage our money and Tasmanians will have to pay the price. The Premier has finally admitted the Liberals have trashed Tasmania's finances. Instead of taking responsibility for fixing this mess, the lazy Liberals want Tasmanians to bail them out and they are going to flog off Tasmania's assets in a fire sale to pay for their mess. Our leader, Dean Winter, has today delivered a strong state of the state speech which was energetic, upbeat and positive for the future of Tasmania. Dean made it very clear that we will fight this government's privatisation agenda and outline our own disciplined, responsible and methodical approach to fixing the mess the Liberals have created.

I warmly welcome Casey Farrell to our team and congratulate him and his family, including the President of the Legislative Council, his dad, Craig Farrell, on his election to this place. Casey will bring fresh new ideas to our caucus and this parliament and that is a great thing. Thanks to each of our Labor candidates who put up their hand for the recounting lines and thanks again to my friend and colleague, Rebecca White, for her service to the Tasmanian Parliament. I take this opportunity to wish all of our federal candidates in the upcoming election all the very best because Julie Collins will continue to be an outstanding member for Franklin, but Rebecca White, Jess Teesdale and Anna Carter will be outstanding federal members in the federal parliament.

I would have to say that the Premier's state of the state speech left me feeling frustrated and with a sense of déjà vu. Tasmanians have heard it all before. The Liberals, after 11 years, have not delivered. During his speech, the Premier made a point of posing what he said were important questions. Well, here are a few more, Premier, just for the record. Red tape reduction, really? What has the Red Tape Reduction Coordinator and the Coordinator-General been doing for the last 11 years? That is a pretty good question to ask. Another really good question is: why did it take an Australian Business Council report for you, after 23 years in the Tasmanian parliament, to understand how many permits it takes to sell a coffee and a pie? Really?

Have you only just realised that Tasmania is over regulated after 11 years of a do-nothing Liberal government or did it really take your interest as you look to life after politics? I think Rocky's pies has a nice ring to it. Following swiftly on from the Premier's move to put a freeze on non-essential staff across the public service, whomever they are - we still do not know yet - came the fire sale of government businesses that will mean, in a cost-of-living crisis, that Tasmanians will be paying more and getting poorer service delivery. There is no two ways about it. 

Back in the 90s, last time the Liberals wrecked the budget, they tried to sell the Hydro. This time they are trying to sell everything but the Hydro and that is what the lazy Liberals do. When they wreck the budget, they privatise. I remember those dark days of the late 90s. It was when I chose to leave Tasmania as a young woman and head to the mainland like so many young Tasmanians are choosing to do now. We need to offer those young Tasmanians a hope, a reason to stay, not sell off their future. 

Yesterday was one of those defining moments in time in this place, the day the Liberals admitted they had blown the budget, squandered Peter Gutwein's golden age and had driven Tasmania's finances deep into the red and that they have nothing to show for it. A day the Liberal minority government revealed its only plan to fix it was to re-announce red tape reduction initiatives, announced a strange audit of legislation and policies, which must mean that they have run out of business in this place, and that they will examine privatising all GBEs except Hydro. 

First, it was TAFE that they have privatised. Now it is our public transport service, Metro. It is the lowest of the lowest. We should be investing in public services to make them better for Tasmania, not flogging them off. To be honest, I do not quite know where to start, looking back at the year that was. 

It was a big year last year in this place and across Tasmania, with the JLN bit of division and divorce from the government; the government forgetting to build the berth and loading infrastructure they needed for their billion dollar ships that they had ordered to be built, the biggest infrastructure project stuff up in the history of Tasmania, the ferry fiasco. You might remember it; the resignation of the deputy premier and treasurer to the backbench; the worst fiscal position in history, a government that is deep in the red with no plan to get back into the black; and a newly minted Planning minister with his signature policies around DAPs (Development Assessment Panel), which got knocked off in the upper House, a sign of a government and a Premier that has lost authority and cannot get anything done in this state. Yet, after all that, we are back here, the government survived and we are here for another inning.

I love Tasmania, from our unique cities and towns, our salt of the earth people, our innovative industries and our businesses, but the longer I am in this parliament, the more frustrated I get with this government and their wasted opportunities and the handbrake they are putting on Tasmania, the state that I love. To be in government should not be taken for granted. It is an enormous responsibility and privilege. To be the premier of this great state should be a privilege, not a right. A premier should govern for all Tasmanians from all corners of the state and have the backs of all workers and their families from right across the state, not just those in high-vis. I know that Dean Winter, as premier, would do just that.

This hapless minority government continues to say that we are talking Tasmania down. I would never talk Tasmania down. I am proud to be Tasmanian. I am proud of the opportunity Tasmania has afforded to me and my family. We are talking down the abysmal record of this state government, full stop.

Tasmanians know what can be achieved with a visionary government. They remember what Tasmania was like under Jim Bacon and Eric Reece. The Liberals did start out with some good ideas, but that is where it ended - with ideas. The problem with this government, the problem that they have, is that they cannot execute those ideas. The most glaring examples of these are the statewide planning system and the ferry fiasco.

Recurrent early elections, recurrent election commitments and spending, broken promises galore, state infrastructure that is not built or up to scratch, including our road networks that not even the Premier's 'pothole blitz' has fixed. Worst health outcomes, worst educational outcomes in the country, worst budget position in history. It is not exactly a glowing record, but you would never know it because the Premier and the government are in complete denial. The greatest problem that we have is the leadership at the top. That is right: a Premier who is paralysed by his minority government and who has terrible difficulty in making a decision and standing by it.

The Spirit lease debacle is the latest example of this, but there are many, many more. A premier who does not know what he stands for, does not know where he wants our state to be. No amount of reflection on what he would say to his former self on social media is going to help with that. He does not know if he is leading with heart. or right-sizing the public sector. What we do know is the two do not go hand in hand. The two do not work together. Cuts to services and people's jobs are heartless.
Let us just look at how farcical this government has become. 'We've always acted in the best interests of the Tasmanian taxpayer'. A quote by the minister, Eric Abetz. It is a catchcry we hear regularly from this government but it could not be any further from the truth. Stretching the truth is something that this government has never had any trouble with, so it should not come as a surprise.

The truth is this: the now minority Liberal government has always put the Liberal Party first and its own self-preservation above all, not the people of Tasmania. In fact, it is worth reminding the House that in order to form a minority government in the first place, they had to have supply and confidence with the JLN members. The Rockliff Liberals had to undertake three reviews - of the Integrity Commission, the state's finances and the stadium project - and now they are in government they pretty much just decided to ignore all these reports. They are where they need to be, I guess, but that does not matter, because the two former JLN, now independent members, might as well be part of the government anyway. The minority Liberal government circus rolls on.

The latest in this farcical series of events is the government - despite ignoring the majority of Saul Eslake's independent report on the state's finances - saying they are now going to work with Saul Eslake on yet another review of its privatisation agenda. It is utopian, it is absurd, and it could only happen in Tasmania.

Let us talk about the Spirits. We have done a lot of that over the last 12 months. Tasmanians are proud of their Spirit of Tasmania vessels. Despite what the Liberal minority government say, Tasmanian Labor is proud of our Spirits. After all, it was a Labor government that brought them to Tasmania. Spirit IV was originally meant to be transporting passengers and freight across Bass Strait by last year. The delays at the Devonport port mean that none of that is expected to happen until 2027. That is what we have been told, but there is no guarantee on that date, given the Liberals' track record on infrastructure projects.

This year started as it began. Not much has changed. It is pretty much like a bad episode of Captain Pugwash, if any of you have ever seen Captain Pugwash. We still have the same captain at the helm of the state's worst infrastructure stuff-up in history and a project over which the government has completely lost control. Events over the weekend only demonstrate that further.

Here is the greatest hit list so far on this project. We have $80 million of taxpayers' money in secret bailouts. We have Finnish-built motors dressed up as local content. We have a berth 1 project that was proceeded with despite expert advice that that would not proceed, and more taxpayer money wasted. We have berth 3 where there are loads of questions in the community about what is happening on site. Progress seems quite slow, and there are concerns about work not being done around the clock. It needs to be done faster now that Spirit IV is finally coming home. We have the storage process, which was really just about saving face, sending the ships to Scotland. More waste of taxpayers' money. Local content, LNG infrastructure - we are still waiting.

We have the leasing process, which is another waste of taxpayers' money. The government said they wanted to end the blame game and then they blamed us for the leasing arrangements going nowhere and the ship coming home. It is extraordinary.

There is plenty more to talk about. What happened over the weekend was a very strange set of events. There is more to see when it comes to relations with the Scottish Government and the negotiation about the lease, but we will leave that for another time. The fact is that the whole leasing farce has been an unnecessary distraction when the government should have been focused on building berth 3. A couple of high-vis media opportunities do not cut it, Premier. It is time we had an update on berth 3 and the progress that has been made.

That brings me now to our budget position. I want to read a couple of quotes from Saul Eslake's really comprehensive report. They are really important in setting the context of where we are at in Tasmania right now.

Since the beginning of European settlement more than two centuries ago, government has always played a major role in the Tasmanian economy and in the lives of Tasmanians. The State Government and its instrumentalities account for a larger share of economic activity and employment in Tasmania than in any other part of Australia … and a larger proportion of Tasmania’s population than of any other state look to the State Government for services that play a vital role in their lives.

The Tasmanian Government’s capacity to meet the expectations which Tasmanians have of it is crucially dependent on its financial position.

…

… a protracted failure to ensure fiscal sustainability almost inevitably leads to a fiscal crisis – which in turn increases the risk of political and social instability, and long-term adverse economic consequences.

Fiscal sustainability is arguably more important for Tasmania, given that its long-term economic performance has been consistently poorer than that of any other state or territory.

This is precisely the tipping point that we are now at in Tasmania. It is very serious. Despite government rhetoric, Mr Eslake states clearly that COVID-19 and the commission of inquiry have contributed to Tasmania's fiscal position, but that the trends began before the pandemic. His review finds that deterioration in the financial position of Tasmania's general government sector - that is, state government departments and agencies funded primarily by taxation revenue or grants from the federal government over the past decade - is entirely attributed to policy decisions by the government.

By contrast, parameter variations, being the effect of factors beyond the controller influence of any state government, such as unforeseen changes in economic activity or employment or decisions made by the federal government, have more often than not had a favourable impact on the government's finances.

What that says to me is that a lot of the economic success of the Liberals was influenced by external factors, not their good management of our state finances. Planned cuts to public service and the privatisation of government assets will hurt Tasmania and Tasmanians. They will have a significant impact on government services provided for Tasmanians, which quite honestly have already been run into the ground by the Liberals.
The government has had 11 years to improve the level of service and focus of our GBEs. These GBEs provide important financial dividends which fund our schools and our hospitals. Where will that funding come from under Jeremy Rockliff's fire sale? This tipping point has been further entrenched through Premier Jeremy Rockliff's minority government with private investment stalling, business confidence declining and the business community's trust in this government at an all-time low.

This was always a government that overpromised. The Premier might think his fake new social media posts are a good strategy, but the charade is over. This government has survived on spin and politics for far too long.

If I look to my shadow portfolio responsibilities in the electorate of Braddon, I want to highlight a couple of things. The first is the state of maternity services on the north-west coast. Maternity services on the north-west coast are a great example of one of those services that has been run into the ground by this government. There is no training currently for obstetrics or gynaecologists on the north-west coast. I know that it has been a terrible time in the south with closing of access to private birthing services, but if you are a family in the north-west, you cannot have a private birth at the moment. I have not seen anyone jumping up and down about that. That is really important and says a lot about the priorities of this government. At the moment, they are relying on 70 per cent agency staff on the maternity ward. They have outdated facilities. We have the highest instance of birth trauma in the state, the least perinatal support services in the state, and the most decentralised population. There is no midwifery course provided by the University of Tasmania in this state. Quite frankly the whole situation is a disgrace.

I ask the Premier whether mothercraft nurses or enrolled nurses working in maternity services across the state are classified as essential workers?

Local government is another passion of mine. It is another example of an area that this government has failed in consecutively over the last 11 years. Nothing has really changed for the sector. If anything, the challenges that they are facing have got worse. The government wasted $3 million undertaking a review of local government, a reform process, when, arguably, a lot of the legislative reform that is coming to the parliament now should have been enacted back in 2019, when they first muted changes to the Local Government Act, which is archaic and needs updating. It is a joke.

We will look at the infrastructure - our roads across the state. Despite Mr Vincent's press release the other day, there are no major infrastructure projects on the horizon other than the stadium, and there is not even approval for that yet. The list included things like Marinus, Robbins Island; they are all off in the never-never. They are all projects that this government has had the distinct inability to deliver for Tasmania. Then there are our roads. 

The parliament might remember Ronnie from Zeehan, who I spoke about in Estimates, who wrote to me concerned about the state of Tasmania's roads. He is not the only one. He and members of the local community in Zeehan were concerned about the dangerous state of our roads and the potholes that plagued them. His concerns have not been allayed by the Premier. The Premier's only response was to fill one pothole on social media; that was his response to the state of our roads.

This is a structural issue. We are determined to get to the bottom of it. We need Tasmanian roads built for Tasmanian conditions. That is what a Labor government will do. This government has no long-term plan for Tasmania, no shared objectives, no goals and no insight into what is really important to all Tasmanians. If they did have a plan, they would not be coming up with a new slogan and a plan every six months after a rocky reset. They have squandered the good times and wasted their good luck. I am angry about the state they have left our state in.

Jeremy Rockliff and the Liberals have proven they cannot manage money. It is Tasmanians who will ultimately have to pay the price. Privatisation ends in increased user costs and decreased services. After 11 years of the Liberals, Tasmanians cannot afford either. One thing is abundantly clear though. The Liberals, under the leadership of Premier Jeremy Rockliff, have reached their expiry date and they are not taking us to the next level. We have hit rock bottom. The Premier has given up, thrown his hands in the air and placed Tasmania's future on the market. 

Our team is reinvigorated and ready to go. We have announced a number of policies over the last year and will continue to outline our positive vision and plan for Tasmania in the months and weeks to come. It is a team that I am proud to be part of. When given the chance to govern, we will not let Tasmanians down. For the record, our plan and pathway to budget repair and our vision for the state will not include new taxes.

[3.19 p.m.]
Mr JENNER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, not surprisingly, I do not believe the Premier's parliamentary address to be overly optimistic, given what the government hopes to achieve in parliament in the coming year. We all already know the economic analysis of Deloitte's believes that Tasmania's gross state product will shrink by 1.1 per cent in 2024-25. That means we are going backwards while, according to Deloitte, every other state is moving forward.

While I would love to embrace the Premier's optimistic view of the state, based on the government's performance in previous years, I find it hard to do so. I am not being negative for negativity. I am just being realistic. The JLN initially held great enthusiasm about this government and what it would deliver in its fourth term, and perhaps more optimistic than most about what this government was capable of.

I believe this was evidenced when we signed our original confidence and supply agreement. Our agreement to provide supply and confidence was based on the government's commitment to commission two independent reports. Perhaps naively, I assumed that by undertaking these reports the government would also take their findings seriously and work with parliament in adopting solutions that had been recommended. Unfortunately, they have instead chosen to discard the reports and all the expert advice within them. In doing so, the government has shown that they are not willing to take on board criticism, nor are they willing to work gravitatively to achieve a positive outcome for Tasmania.

The ferry fiasco is undeniably one of the worst - and I will not say cock-up; I will say stuff-up this state has ever seen.

The SPEAKER - I appreciate that, Mr Jenner. 

Mr JENNER - Blame being tossed around by the government in every direction except the mirror, leaving no-one else untouched by the controversy of finger pointing. Embarrassingly, this mess-up was big enough to even be broadcast in the United Kingdom. Understandably, Tasmanians are starting to lose confidence in the government. We have had seven years to build a suitable port and still it cannot be delivered anywhere near time. A quick glance at the Geelong website shows that they had their deal wrapped up in two years. It has already been operating for an additional two years. They had access to the same information that we did, yet somehow the government just could not get it together.

However, I am not here to dwell on the mistakes of last year. What does concern me, though, is that this government is making the same mistake with an arguably unnecessary, more costly infrastructure project: Macquarie Point stadium. Despite three separate economic assessments, two of them commissioned as part of the stadium case and one from an independent expert, all showing it does not stack up, this government has chosen to totally ignore it all in a stunning display of arrogance. A fourth independent assessment, this time on the state's budget by Saul Eslake, found that comparatively we have been running the biggest infrastructure program in Australia, despite the fact that we have been living beyond our means for years.

Anyone who has run a business or a household knows that it cannot go on this way. You will go broke. We need to change. One of Australia's most well-respected economists, Dr Nicholas Gruen, forensically examined every aspect of the Macquarie Point stadium project. We should heed his warning. The stadium does not make financial sense. No-one is denying that we need or should have an AFL team but the price should not be another stadium that we simply cannot afford. Rather than own up to their mistakes or admit defeat, the Liberal government has chosen to dig in its heels and make decisions that, I believe, do not benefit Tasmanians.

It is truly baffling that this government hand-picked two independent economists for separate reports only to completely dismiss their findings - sending their spin doctors into overdrive, desperately trying to dress up their failures as successes. Dr Gruen's report should have been the nail in the coffin for the stadium project. Dr Gruen stated that the project showed all the hallmarks of mismanagement, with costs significantly understated and the benefits significantly overstated. He has projected a cost-benefit analysis showing that return is just 44 cents on the dollar. Most businesses that I know would not go near an investment like that, but we are told the list is full. I look forward to seeing that. Millions have been spent to be told what was obvious from the start: the stadium in its current format, and I say current format, just does not stack up financially. 

If the Project of State Significance (PoSS) report also delivers a negative verdict on the stadium, no-one will be surprised if the government dismisses that as well. A clear pattern is emerging. Every economist who has got their hands on the state's finances has said it reads like an account in shambles, and yet the government remains utterly indifferent.

As we near the six-month anniversary of the Eslake report, the government promised a comprehensive response. Essentially, there has been no response at all. Choosing not to implement of any of the recommendations outlined is not a response; it is a joke. For a government in this bad a financial position, you would think they would take any help they could get.

The chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Ruth Forrest's, recent op-ed 'Sleepwalking to Disaster' is an excellent shakedown of how this government and others are choosing to operate the state. It states:

Few have taken any issue with the prognosis laid out by Saul Eslake in his landmark report into the State's finances. Even fewer have modified their policy positions to reflect the harsh reality of our predicament.

Now, more than ever, we need to be focused on real solutions that properly address the financial mess that we are in and not hide from it. We need to prioritise where we will spend our money and what little funds we have. It should obviously go into health, education, housing, and frontline staff. To not do this is completely irresponsible. 

Last month, we heard stories of stroke patients at the LGH being given icy poles to cool them down because of what the lack of infrastructure funding meant for the air conditioning system. The hospital was completely inadequately covered. A separate report on the same issue stated that the risk of heat exhaustion and heat stroke was a real concern for staff, with one staff member saying it was unbearable working at the LGH on hot days. A letter to the editor from a patient in the stroke ward at the LGH said:

There is not even a breath of fresh air in the corridors. It was horrendous. I was just lying there gasping for air and using a wet wash rung out in ice water in a vain attempt to keep cool.

The lack of infrastructure funding in our health system is not confined to the LGH. We know that the planned expansion of the Royal Hobart Hospital emergency department has been cut back because of budget constraints. The Public Works Committee recommended - the Department of Health submission committee - $149 million for the project. We know that that budget has now been reduced by 13 per cent to $130 million. We know that doctors believe that the cut price job will struggle to meet demands when it opens and have zero capacity to handle any future demands.

We also know that the Australian Medical Association (AMA) believes that the top priority for infrastructure spending should be on a second public hospital in the south, to put an end to the decades of onsite renovations that have made operating in the Royal far more difficult than it should have been. In a media release in October last year, the AMA made it clear that decades of costly, morale-crushing renovations have left the Royal outdated and inefficient. While other states built new hospitals, Tasmania remains stuck in ageing infrastructure. It is time for a visionary approach, a second acute hospital within five to 10 minutes of the old one on the current site to meet the needs of the growing population.

Very few Tasmanians would argue that essential health infrastructure should take place over a multi-billion dollar stadium. Spending on health is money that needs to be spent. It might not be the legacy project that this government was hoping to leave behind, but it is necessary and it needs to be done now. Tasmanians are suffering from this government's skewed priorities.

The lessons that Gruen has given us in this report do not only apply to the stadium project, but can be applied to every single infrastructure project this government embarks on going forward. It is okay to admit the stadium does not stack up. In fact, people would have far more respect for this government if they did.

Last year, the Queensland Government scrapped the plans for the Gabba rebuild. The Premier there, Steven Miles, declared at a time when Queenslanders struggling with housing and rising cost of living, 'I cannot justify spending $3.4 billion on a new stadium'. This is what common sense looks like. It is what responsible governments do.

The government is cutting red tape. It appears that this is a 2025 catchphrase, along with selling the family silver. We have seen it everywhere and heard it. While reducing unnecessary bureaucracy, especially for small businesses, is not something I would turn my nose up at, but it needs to be done carefully. Too often governments announce red tape cuts, only to be replaced with a new set of bureaucratic hurdles. To reform means making processes simpler and more efficient, not just shifting the burden elsewhere. I truly hope that is what is going to happen.

The potential sale of the GBEs and other public assets as a means of revenue-raising is deeply concerning. It is a short-term solution to a long-term problem. It is like selling the family silver for a quick sale and cash injection. There is no denying that this government needs money, but selling off public assets is not the answer.

I have seen this play out in the United Kingdom where privatising essential services has led to profit-driven decision-making at the expense of the public. Private companies obviously prioritise the bottom line, often cutting out services that may not be profitable but are crucial to many in the community. Once these assets have gone, they are gone for good, and the public are left paying the price.

This should not be a priority to the government plan of raising revenue. The first step towards the budget getting back on track should be immediately scrapping all non-essential infrastructure projects.

Over the parliamentary summer break, I had the opportunity to engage more with my community firsthand, gaining valuable insight into the issues that matter most to the people. These conversations have reinforced my understanding and the key priorities that will help me guide my work for the year ahead. My electorate of Lyons is made up of predominantly rural and regional areas. Services and spaces such as the Men's Shed and community houses are particularly important. Strong communities are built in spaces where people come together and support one another to find purpose.

Men's sheds, neighbourhood houses and community hubs are more than just buildings. They are lifelines for connections, wellbeing and social inclusion. Investing in these spaces is not just good policy, it is essential to strengthening the fabric of our society. The Men's Shed in Triabunna recently approached me deeply concerned about losing their space, a vital hub for community connections, skill building and wellbeing. Sadly, this government has shown that spaces such as these are not a priority.

Another deeply concerning sign of how much people are struggling is the growing reliance on neighbourhood houses and community houses for food and essential resources. Several community and neighbourhood houses in Lyons were forced to turn people away or limit food distributions before Christmas due to the lack of funds and resources.
This is a stark indictment of the crisis unfolding in our state at the moment. People are struggling to survive. We need to ensure our communities are succeeding, and that takes money. If the government believes we have enough money to spend on a stadium, then we should have more than enough money to help and support these grassroots communities.

Last year, members of the Retired Police Association approached me with a concerning issue around the lack of mental health support available for retired frontline officers. At first, I found it hard to believe that those who had dedicated their life to service were left without support after retirement. However, nothing now surprises me. I acknowledge that workers diagnosed with mental health issues during their service receive ongoing support. However, conditions like PTSD do not follow a set timeline. As history has shown us with thousands of returned soldiers, PTSD can emerge and intensify years after the initial trauma. Frontline workers deserve and should have ongoing mental health support. I am sure many of us could not even imagine the things they have had to deal with on a day-to-day basis.

Holding the government to account should be the top priority of any crossbencher. We are elected to serve the community, not to rubber-stamp the government's decisions. That means scrutinising policies, challenging poor decisions and demanding transparency. The real result comes from collaboration, accountability and genuine debate. It may not be this government's ideal way of working, but it is what Tasmanians voted for and what I aim to deliver. I made myself very clear when I voted against last year's budget. I am not here to prop up a Liberal government. I am here for Tasmanians.

If this government actually wants to function, it needs to start being transparent with parliament. Feigning surprise when legislation fails after neglecting proper consultation is not a strategy, it is incompetence.

I truly hope that this year we can work together collaboratively as a parliament to achieve the best results for all Tasmanians.

[3.35 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Minister for Business, Industry and Resources) - Honourable Speaker, the 2030 Strong Plan, which was our election manifesto, followed up by our recent Budget and then followed up by yesterday's state of the state address, are the trifecta of documentation that we as a government have put forward to the people of Tasmania. They provide a plan for the future, a vision for the future, and they ensure that we have a road to surplus to guarantee and protect the next generation.

This stands in stark contrast to those sitting opposite who went to the last election with a manifesto priced at least twice, if not three times, the amount of money that we went to the election with.

The question that all Tasmanians need to ask themselves in relation to the budget and the future of Tasmania is, amongst other things, what is the right size of the Tasmanian public service? It is a right and proper question to ask. Those opposite, the Greens, are clearly unable to answer that question, let alone ask it. Now, in our private lives, in our households, from time to time, we have to make decisions. What are our priorities? If the interest rates go up on a house mortgage, you have to make savings elsewhere. 

You have to be adept, you have to be agile, you have to be able to juggle your budget. Those of us who have run a business know full well that those sorts of considerations apply in business as well. They also apply to government and it is good and proper that you do a review of household expenditure, business expenditure or, in this case here, of government expenditure.

Is the public service the right size or, in the particular area, has it grown beyond its needs or is it too small? Those sorts of questions need to be asked on a regular basis and we, as a government, have the courage and the commitment to ask those questions, despite the fact that we knew that by raising those fundamental questions we would be subjected to a scare campaign. We looked at some government business enterprises and scoped them and asked fundamental questions: are they serving the people of Tasmania to the very best of their ability? Should they be configured in a different way? Would they be better off privatised? They are questions that we should not be too scared to ask and those who are too scared to ask those questions are unfit for the role of governance. 

Let us be very clear: the Labor Party, in Canberra, sold off Qantas, they sold off the Commonwealth Bank, they sold off Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) and do you know what? The world still turned, the sun rose again every morning and here, locally, the Labor Party of course does not want to talk about the sale of the Hobart Airport. Remember that? Did it stop aeroplanes coming in and out of Tasmania? Did it stop the world? No, it did not. 

Those questions need to be asked, considered and then acted upon. Just because the Premier is willing to have a look at all the business enterprises, other than Hydro, to ascertain how they can deliver better for the people of Tasmania is something that this House ought to embrace and be thankful for, rather than saying 'business as usual'.

Well, business as usual will not allow the budget to find a way to surplus. The people of Tasmania know that. They know that some tough decisions need to be made and, from COVID onwards, we have seen the public service grow and at the time of COVID, I think an argument can be made that it needed to grow to help with the circumstances we faced and every single state and the Commonwealth saw a burgeoning of the public service numbers for that particular emergency. 

The question now is: should the public service remain the size that emergency required or should we start to downsize it again? As we are seeing in Victoria, a Labor state government, what we saw in Queensland with the then-Labor state government, what we are seeing in Canberra as well, there is a recognition that we have to confront these issues and deal with them to the very best of our ability.

What disappoints me in this place is that, day after day, and I am sure it is going to happen, it happened last year, I am sure it will happen this year, the Labor Party, out of one side of their mouth, talks about the deficit and the budget out of control and then somebody else asked a question about cuts. Well, you cannot have it both ways. You cannot talk to the people of Tasmania with a full tongue. You cannot say out of the one side there is far too much expenditure and then on the other side of your mouth complain that there are going to be savings money. You have to be honest with the people of Tasmania and that is what we as a government are seeking to do. 

So bereft of talent are they on the other side that they were unable to deliver an alternate budget. Where is their blueprint? Where is their 2030 Strong Plan? Where is their alternate budget? All we heard earlier today was relentless negativity from the Leader of the Opposition, full of problems, alleged, but no solutions, no vision, no forward thinking, no idea as to how we ought to go into the future other than we have a pretty good hint. We were going to increase revenue from the government business enterprises. What does that mean?

People will have to pay more for the services that the government business enterprises provide. That is taxation in any other name. Everybody knows that, and the people of Tasmania will not be fooled in relation to that. Indeed, the Labor Party in this state, as I understand it, is still under federal administration because they cannot run themselves. They are still unable to have an endorsed candidate for the federal seat of Clark, as I understand it. That is how bereft they are. Canberra does not trust them to run their own show. They cannot even find a candidate for the seat of Clark. Yet, here they are with the audacity to tell us how we ought to be running the government of this state. Until you can run yourselves, do not pretend that you have the capacity to lecture us and hector us about the way that the state ought to be run. 

Clearly, there are difficult issues to be faced by this government and the government is willing to ask the questions, probe and have a look and there might be some uncomfortable answers. If they are uncomfortable, then we as a government will deal with them and take the people of Tasmania on that journey with us because I think they understand that there is a need to deal with the issues that confront us. 

Can I briefly turn to the issue of the stadium and Dr Gruen's report. I had the opportunity of discussing that report personally with Dr Gruen. We agreed that our discussion would remain confidential and private and I will honour that. The one thing that I will say with due respect to all economists, and I love them dearly, but you get two economists in a room and you will get three opinions. It is an inexact science. The respected Dr Gruen, if he is so respected, as Mr Jenner said, said 40 cents on the dollar return on the investment. KPMG told us it was 50 per cent more in the high 60s. Who is right? Dr Gruen or KPMG? Quite frankly to you, member for Lyons, I do not know, but it is interesting. Also interesting is that the same analysis of the Townsville Stadium suggested a return of 21.9 cents on the dollar. The Hobart one, according to Dr Gruen, is worth twice as much. 

All I would say to the member for Lyons, for whom I have a great degree of affection, and anybody else from a rural regional area, if we start analysing every infrastructure project on the basis of return on the dollar, you would not have any rural or regional roads. Tasmania would only have one hospital. All the Commonwealth infrastructure would be spent in Melbourne and Sydney, and Tasmania would not get a look in. There are other considerations than just simply the dollar return. 

It is so bizarre, in particular, when I hear the Greens all of a sudden want to become economic rationalists and say that the dollar return is not big enough for the stadium. This will be transformative for our state. Yes, it will be a difficult project, but it will be an iconic gateway to our capital city and will stand for something which, I think, future generations will be able to look back on and say, 'What a great development. Good on them for doing it'. As I understand it, no single stadium - be it the Townsville one, the Adelaide one or the Perth one - has ever been welcomed until after they were built. Then everybody rushes to them and says, 'What a great idea it was'. I am very hopeful that history will repeat itself in relation to the Hobart Stadium.
In the moments remaining, I will talk about the productive sectors of our economy. They are often overlooked. We, as a government are concerned to have red tape cut. We are concerned to ensure that the productive sectors of our economy perform exceptionally well - not because we want to win a prize in economics, but because we know the social good that flows from it. The most important one of these is jobs. That is what motivates us in trying to have the very best economy that we can. Every single job is the best social welfare system that one can imagine.

Ms Haddad - Then why are you cutting jobs?

Mr ABETZ - The self-reliance - and might I add, in relation to the relatively quiet interjection from the member for Clark, Ms Haddad, when we came to government, the unemployment rate was 8.6 per cent. That was 8.6 per cent of human misery when our economy was in recession. Today, unemployment is 4 per cent, less than half. There is still more work to do, fully accepted, but nevertheless a good result.

In relation to cutting of red tape, we have looked at the rental car business, we have looked at the forestry, we have looked at a whole host of areas and we will continue to cut red tape as more and more examples come to light. We are committed to that because it helps business flourish, which helps job creation and job maintenance.

In relation to forestry, I simply say to those who sought to aid and abet, encourage and legitimise the illegitimate activities of yesterday that if we do not have native forestry, the demand for wood will not diminish. All it will mean is, as we have seen by the stupid decision of the Victorian and the New South Wales and Western Australian governments in stopping native forestry, what did they see come as a result - hardwood imports from the Solomon Islands, from Malaysia, from Indonesia, from South America. There has been a 40 per cent increase in hardwood imports into Australia. Is that good for the world environment?

Does anybody do forestry better than we do it in Tasmania? The IPCC and other organisations and the former chief scientist from CSIRO, Dr John Raison, tell us that native forest harvesting is good for the environment if it is balanced, as it is in Tasmania, with over 50 per cent of our land mass in reserves. When you get that balance right, you are doing something exceptionally well. However, those in the Greens would seek to cut out native forestry. Keep in mind that native forestry, the vast bulk of it, is in fact regrowth forest, which they now claim is so pristine that it is worthy of protection. Does that not tell you something about the way we do forestry? It does come back, it does regrow, the natural balances are preserved and we get a truly renewable product.

If you do not use wood, what do you use? Plastic, concrete, aluminium, and so the list goes on. What do you think is better for the environment? We all know the answer. That is why the ideological - and might I add, sometimes just the cynical - fundraising arm of the Greens, namely the Bob Brown Foundation has to be called to account.

It is similar in relation to fish farming. There has in recent times been a very real and genuine concern in the community about the mortalities that have occurred in fish farms. You know what? They have occurred on cattle farms and in chicken farms around the world. It is a matter of genuine concern. You would never wish that on anybody and the lack of sympathy shown especially - there is even a chuckle. How ugly and horrendous is that, to be able nearly to dance or seek to dance on the difficulties being confronted by the salmon industry and all the workers who are gainfully employed.

Mr Bayley - We are just standing up for the communities that want their coastlines protected, minister. They do not like chunks of decomposing flesh washing up on their beaches.

Mr ABETZ - Of course, who cheers on the Bob Brown Foundation in their policy? It is the Chilean fish farmers from across the oceans who are now importing their product courtesy of the federal Labor government. They condemn foreign investment in Australia in fish farms, but are more than willing to accept the imports from foreign fish farms that do not employ a single Tasmanian in the production.

That is the result of the activities of the Bob Brown Foundation. What is one of their accusations? That these companies do not pay tax. Can I make this point? Every single company in Australia is subjected to exactly the same tax law as any Australian company. Guess what? Does the Bob Brown Foundation pay tax? No, it does not. What gross hypocrisy. The Bob Brown Foundation, with its millions of dollars flowing in, does not pay tax. It then has the audacity to point to a company and falsely allege that they do not pay tax. As I was taught as a kid, if you point at somebody, there are always three fingers pointing back at yourself. That is exactly what is happening with the Bob Brown Foundation in relation to these false allegations. They make these false allegations hoping that those living in a comfortable lifestyle in Melbourne and Sydney might continue to bankroll them in the pursuit or alleged pursuit of looking after the environment.

As my time comes to an end in relation to this contribution, can I say that when I first got up in this place I said that I would dedicate myself to service. I will continue to do so because I know that this state has a great future. People who visit this place want to stay here. Why? It is because we are doing something pretty damn good here as we speak. Things are going relatively well, but they can always be done better. We, as a government, recognise that challenge. That is why we are willing to ask the tough questions. That is why we are willing to ask whether our government business enterprises are serving the people of Tasmania as well as they might. Is the public service the right size?

Those sorts of questions are healthy to ask. We should not be afraid of asking them. We should not be afraid of the answers. That is why I look forward to the results of the scoping studies and the other considerations that we are currently undertaking as a government, to ensure that we deliver the best possible governance for our wonderful state of Tasmania, which I have the privilege of serving in this House.

[3.55 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to make my contribution to the debate in response to the Premier's state of the state address. I am shocked with the Premier's speech, with its brevity, with its absence of grace, with its lack of thanks, with its blokey aggression, with its Trumpian tone and its shallow agenda, and with a naked, barefaced pitch to cut jobs in the public service and flog public businesses and the services they deliver, to plug a budget black hole of his own making and pay for a billion-dollar stadium that Tasmanians do not want, do not need and cannot afford.

Where was the gracious acknowledgement of our teachers, our firefighters, our police and other public servants? Where was the vision for the future? The compassionate follow on from the commission of inquiry, the commitment to quality education, to world class healthcare, to reducing the ever escalating waitlist of social and affordable housing? Where were those rose coloured glasses, even if fake? No mention of the AFL team and not a single whisper of the stadium, a legacy piece for this Premier that will supposedly revolutionise Tasmania's economic and social opportunities. No waxing on about clean and clever. No commitment to truth and reconciliation. So much for heart.

Instead, we had Tasmania's own Trump. Axing government jobs, flogging public assets, waging a war on regulation, and fawning over high-vis. Then there is the fraud. How can a man who so comprehensively ignored the recommendations of independent economist Saul Eslake's review for the state's finances, keep a straight face when announcing Mr Eslake's appointment to implement reforms to government business enterprises? I quote, 'Keep Tasmania on a sound economic footing'. This government is becoming a parody.

Saul Eslake is the economist who belled the cat on Tasmania's economic footing, highlighting the parlous state of the finances and the fact that it is government policy that got us here. Let me read into Hansard exactly what Mr Eslake has said about the Tasmanian Government's fiscal decisions. I quote:

Drawing on publicly available information, the Review finds that the deterioration in the financial position of Tasmania's 'general government sector' - … - over the past decade is entirely attributed to 'policy decisions' by government …

…

Tasmania's public sector finances have deteriorated significantly since the latter part of the 2010s - despite a noticeable improvement in Tasmania's economic fortunes …

These trends were partly attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic, and more recently to the need to provide for compensation payments to survivors of child sexual abuse in state institutions. But they began before the onset of the pandemic, and have continued after it.

So $9.6 billion of debt by 2028, $500 million each year to service it; and $16 billion estimated by 2035 and a whopping $730 million in annual interest repayments. The figures are staggering and it cannot go on. After 10 years of the Liberals, Tasmania is in a bit of a mess. The budget is cooked, our wilderness is burning, decomposing salmon wash ashore, and with some of the worst, if not the worst results in healthcare, education, and housing. The government is secretive, opaque, and deceptive.

From that state of the state review, anyone would think Premier Rockliff had just taken office and had someone else's stuff to fix up. Make no mistake, not enough is being done to turn it around. This state of the state review revealed just whose advice is driving Tasmania forward. It is not the independent experts. It is not Dr Nicholas Gruen or Mr Eslake. It is not the public service and it is not the Tasmanian people. It is 100 per cent clear from this address that it is a hard right that is in control of the Liberals.

The hard right is doing the bidding of the big party donors who want a free kick and an easy ride. The far right is dancing to the tune of major industrials and property developers looking for the limits to be lifted. The neoliberals are seeking a fire sale of government assets and smaller government services to cover escalating debt from bad decisions and dub deals. Just think, stadium.

This is a bad place for Tasmania to find itself. As international politics lurches beyond the right and into absurdity, we should resist it infecting us here, and resist it we will. There is no mandate for cutting the public service and flogging state owned assets.

A quick review of the Liberals policy pitch to the Tasmanian people in March 2024 reveals 99 policies, including ones that address both public service and government businesses, but not a peep on cuts or sell offs.

Let me read the relevant policies:

requiring government businesses to deliver outcomes consistent with the Tasmanian Liberals policy objectives;

deliver services to Tasmanians at the lowest sustainable cost while also growing our economy and engaging with businesses and community in a constructive manner; and

not growing back office public service numbers on a per capita basis. 

A re-elected majority Liberal government will remain committed to improving the provisions of services to the community including growth in frontline workers. In this context, the Tasmanian Liberals will seek to improve public sector productivity by carefully managing and transparently managing full-time equivalent growth.

Despite directly referencing issues in the so-called strong plan, there is no mention of cuts. There is no reference to asset sales. This is a deceptive government, writing the rules as it goes and flailing around in a toxic soup of hard right ideology captured by vested interests and actions against the needs of Tasmanians. This government is failing to deliver the care, transparency and sound decision making that Tasmanians deserve. 

I acknowledge that we meet on the unceded lands of the Muwinina people and pay my respects to the Palawa community and Elders past and present. As the Muwinina did not survive invasion, their hopes and aspirations live on through the Tasmanian Aboriginal community.

I note again, as we made the Tasmanian Greens representation opposing a private commercial zip-line development on Kunanyi, that another destructive development detested by Aboriginal people and exploiting a living Aboriginal cultural landscape on Kunanyi is to be assessed against the flawed Aboriginal Heritage Act. It is over three and a half years now since the then minister, Mr Jaensch, came into this House and tabled a formal report into the review of the Aboriginal Heritage Act that conceded that it simply did not work. To read from the review report itself:

Need for a new act.

The review has confirmed the government's long standing position that the act is considerably out of date and that new legislation is required. It is clear that the act itself does not provide effective mechanisms for protection, nor does it adequately consider the significance of Aboriginal heritage in the context of Aboriginal culture.

A long-standing position: the act does not work. On 21 July 2021, this government admitted that to this House but nothing has been done to update it. 

Meanwhile, highly problematic projects like the cable car, Robbins Island Wind Farm, Flinders Island Marina, and now this stupid zip-line are assessed against the ineffective act. Just fix it. It has to be a priority. It is more important than pretending to deal with red tape. It is simply not good enough to let it languish and allow highly contested project proposals be driven through the gaping hole this government refuses to fix.

Kunanyi remains a natural and cultural treasure that people will stand up to defend. There have been hundreds of representations to the Hobart City Council process assessing the zip-line as they were for the so-called strategic review of Kunanyi. We, as do many others, remain deeply mistrustful of that review process, not independent of government, with a steering committee of departmental heads all under the direction of their ministers. It is clear that this is a stitch up to undermine the Wellington Park Management Trust planning process and pave the way for a cable car and other private commercial development that is simply not permitted under current planning and management rules. The zip-line falls into that category.

Here today, I say thank you. Thanks to the organisations and individuals who have made the effort to submit their views to both the zip-line and the Abetz review on the mountain. There have been eight cable car proposals for Kunanyi and, as expressed in Wellington Park Management Trust historical notes of Wellington Park, all have been strongly protested by citizens of Hobart. Rest assured, we will continue to protest. There is a critical mass of people committed to keeping Kunanyi cable car-free and its management plans, strong and enforceable. On the environment, this government has been worse than neglectful. While there is wilful apathy on one hand, on the other there are active decisions knowingly made at the expense of the environment.

September's State of the Environment Report was a complete and utter wake up call. The first State of the Environment Report for 15 years - because this government wilfully ignored two statutory reporting deadlines in a row - paints a dire picture of Tasmania's environmental health with nearly two-thirds of key environmental indicators in decline or rated poor. The State of the Environment Report covers nine indicators and the data is alarming: 16, 55 per cent are deteriorating; six, 21 per cent are stable; two, 7 per cent are improving; and five, 17 per cent are unknown. Despite this, and the centrality of the environment to Tasmania's brand, economy and social fabric, government has dismissed outright or fabricated deceptive responses to many for the specific recommendations. 

The Environment Protection Authority remains toothless and unable to properly regulate destructive industries like aquaculture. This year's catastrophic die off of farm salmon in south-east waters highlights just how bad finfish regulations are. Despite the upper House recommendations that salmon farming be removed from its inshore waters, it is bigger and badder than ever with an expansion agenda into the waters of Storm Bay and eyes on the north and north-west coasts. As the inevitable disease and deaths that come with high density and warming waters intensify, the case to bring salmon farming onshore simply intensifies also for the environment, for coastal communities and for jobs.

The EPA continues to gum away on toxic salmon and it's decomposing carcasses and the newly decreed war on regulations where Premier Rockliff wants a 'one-in, two-out' approach to legislation and regulation, one wonders what must be lost in order to finally rein in toxic salmon.

We Greens can recommit to defending our environment as we have always done. We want to see strengthened legislation and regulation, not weakened, so the places that make Tasmania truly special are retained, protected and respected in the common interest.

I take the opportunity to acknowledge the heartbreak of many who for weeks recently watched the wildfires on the east coast and Cradle Mountain National Park meander with the winds and bit by bit consume over 100,000 hectares of country. Without action on climate change and the resources to tackle multiple remote area fires immediately and at the same time, the dry lightning and drying landscape will see more tragedy and heartbreak year by year, piece by piece. I put on the record here my thanks to firefighters for their efforts and their commitment.

Whether fire - industrial legacy or illegal - the impacts on our environment have been great and we have a clear need to put back and right wrongs inflicted over past years. Restoration of degraded or destroyed landscapes can deliver environmental, social, economic and employment wins and build credibility back into Tasmania's clean, green and clever brand and identity.

In the United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, the opportunity for exposure, funding and support is immense, but Lake Pedder and the refusal to embrace a vision to right the immense wrong demonstrates the Liberals are content to let these opportunities go.

While Hydro seems immune, the Premier has confirmed this morning that Tasmania's other power entities are in the gun for sale or long-term lease - what we can and should consider as effectively a sale. That includes Aurora Energy. Time and time again privatisation has been shown to increase prices, reduce services and jeopardise jobs. Aurora is a power provider for Tasmania's households. They send out the electricity bills. If they are privatised, it is fair to assume that those bills will go up. In a cost-of-living crisis, we simply cannot afford that.

Marinus adds uncertainty and conflict into the mix. While it too will drive up prices with a huge capital cost and locking us into the National Electricity Market (NEM), it appears it will drive destruction at the North West Transmission line with a rush on for wind, where many like Robbins Island are located in absolutely the wrong location. Renewable energy cannot come at the expense of the environment or proper planning processes, and it must bring the community along.

Sadly, with the perversion of processes like major project assessments and parliamentary approvals, confidence in the renewables rollout in Tasmania is low.

Tassie's education results continue to lag the nation despite the valiant effort of our teachers, teacher aides, specialist support professionals and admin support to whom I offer the Greens heartfelt thanks. Many a measure does not meet the expectations and needs of the state. I acknowledge the funding negotiations with the federal government that improve school funding, but there remains a loophole that sees much of that funding diverted from classrooms. The loophole means that $260 million is diverted from classrooms into non-teaching costs like depreciation, transport and the Teachers Registration Board. Until that loophole is closed, no-one can claim that 100 per cent of the schooling resource standard is delivered to our schools and our students.

We now have an education review. We will watch closely the government response. It cannot be another left on the shelf to gather dust. It must come with the funding to mean genuine outcomes can be truly delivered.

Meanwhile, sitting above everything is a billion dollar stadium - a stadium Tasmanians do not want, do not need and cannot afford. Again, Dr Nicholas Gruen's expert analysis that found costs underestimated, benefits overstated and the project bearing 'all the hallmarks of mismanagement' is ignored. Recent documents reveal impacts on the Cenotaph, despite landscaping. Abandoning the Collins Street pedestrian bridge means parking and a lane of traffic on Davey Street will need to be closed. The recent polling shows we do not want it. Existing stadiums where AFL is already played demonstrates we do not need it. The recent KPMG report published with the PoSS documentation shows we simply cannot afford it. To quote directly from the report:

Need. If existing schools and hospitals are insufficient to meet the needs of Tasmanians such that education standards and health standards of some citizens are being compromised, then other things being equal, the benefits of building a new school or hospital will be very large and almost certainly larger than the benefits of an equivalent investment in a stadium.

Enough said. No-one can claim that Tasmania's health and education needs are being adequately met. We can add housing in there too. The social housing wait list is getting larger and longer. Despite the supposed record investment, the 4000 homes the Premier references have long been shown to be a mirage. Figures are fudged and forged, counting as houses, vacant land, crisis accommodation and health-worker accommodation. 

Adding to this housing supply mix - the extraordinary shift of whole home rental properties to the short stay market as the Liberals stand back and let Airbnb set the agenda. Report after report highlight the loss of rental homes, swapped out for short stay hotels in a system that advantages those who already have at the expense of those who do not. Renters continue to languish with limited rights. We Greens are committed to helping them out. We will work to ensure no-cause evictions, ensure all rentals have minimum standards and try to curb the extraordinary rent increases that are driving housing stress and pushing people into homelessness.

Meanwhile, the long-promised Liberal commitment to shift the playing field and allow renters to keep the pet they love seems kicked into the long grass. Renters' rights and other relevant stakeholders' feedback to us is that no-one has picked up the phone to consult with them about the legislation, potential amendments and when it is coming back to this House.

As the days tick by, it looks like yet another Liberal promise broken. When it comes to promises lost, add pets in rentals to the pokies pre-commitment card. Pokies ruin lives, literally. They are designed and located to strip cash from our community's most vulnerable to line the pockets of those who already have far more than they need. In what is now revealed as a monumental deceit of his own ministers and the electorate, a secret deal was done by the Premier to put the card on the back burner and make sure it never sees the light of day. Such a shame. Pokies should be stripped from pubs and clubs. Failing that, a card-based playing system that restricts losses and protects people is the least we, as leaders, can and should deliver. 

Speaking of leaders, let me acknowledge the role of Rosalie, member for Franklin, for her role in leading our party to a red-letter election and record number of Greens in the Tasmanian parliament. Finally cracking two seats in Clark with my colleague, Helen, and retaking a Greens seat in both Lyons and Bass with Tabatha and Cecily, we Greens are back in bulk on the crossbench and standing up as the real opposition in Tasmanian politics. Thanks Rosalie for your role in that and leading us into this House. Congrats and thanks to my colleagues one and all for the work you do, the commitment you bring and the defiance you display. 

Thank you, too, to my predecessor Cassy, now sitting on red velvet and carrying the flag for Greens values and policy in the Legislative Council. Not only does that break new ground and create new opportunity for we Greens upstairs, it means your knowledge, history and wisdom is not lost to us. Better still, it is directly on hand. Together we are looking forward to the parliamentary year. 

Despite the revelations of yesterday, the emergence of a hard-right agenda as central to the Liberals' mission, we are optimistic and energised. We will hold the government to account. We will expose the deceit. We will stand up for what matters. We will progress where we can, working with those in this Chamber willing and able to put the interests of Tasmanians ahead of their own.

We face a situation where we condemn our children to a poisoned inheritance, a mountain of debt, second-rate services and environment in decline, sliding down an increasingly steep and slippery slope. It is intergenerational theft, a tax that future generations do not deserve and cannot afford. The decisions we make today affect us all, but they will affect our children even more. We have to get them correct. We Greens will make sure that we are on the right side of history and can look those kids in the eye with confidence that we did all we could to make it right. Thank you. 

Members - Hear, hear.

[4.14 p.m.]
Ms OGILVIE (Clark - Minister for the Environment) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, to make my first contribution for 2025, I first congratulate our Premier on his outstanding state of the state address - the many highlights in that speech. He covered many portfolio areas. It was clear to me that it was strategic in a way that we have not seen in this state for some time. He has leant into that. The way we are going to go about this matters. It matters to set the program of work across business aspiration, focusing on the creation of more and better paying jobs, cutting unnecessary legislation or retiring legislation, which is entirely sensible, and importantly, managing the state's finances responsibly. It is incredibly meaningful, and as the Premier said, encouraging people through incentive rather than through limitations is good. It is aspirational. We are all optimistic.

I want to quickly reflect: I have been listening all day today to the contributions. It is interesting. I am always interested to hear what people would like to come into this Chamber and speak of and it all does seem to be very topical things. That is good to do, but I would also like to suggest that when we have the leader of the Labor opposition trying to tell us that Labor has changed, it does feel like the leopard explaining how his spots look different, even though to the observer the spots are entirely the same.

With the Greens, I should say, I think Dr Woodruff ought to be a little bit worried because I think Mr Bayley would make a very good leader of the Greens. He is obviously on the way through, so that will be interesting to see where that goes. I did note that the Greens with their Henny Pennying around 'the sky is falling', their protest politics, catastrophising to their base as usual and scaring the kids is probably not where the mainstream want to have our politics.

As I have said, our government has a track record of working to deliver a stronger and more resilient economy. That gives us the best opportunity for dealing with cost-of-living pressures which are very real to many Tasmanian families. We need to continue our investment in health, which we are doing, and we need a strong economy at the same time.

The Premier's speech touched on things that really matter to a lot of Tasmanians, to a lot of Tasmanian families. I always think about it in terms of, 'What touches us as Tasmanians?' As a mum who has done many years of the school run, whether it is building safe roads, making sure our schools are in great shape, or hospitals delivering what we need to deliver, the simple fact is that it is all and must all be underpinned by a strong economy.

The opposition, as I have mentioned, would have us believe things have changed over there, but they are relentless: the incessant negativity about the economy, talking things down. It is just really not on. I really hope they are able to improve their performance.

Rest assured, our government and our plan for Tasmania's future - a future that does make this place, which I think it is already, a great place to live - we want it to be the best place to live, to work and raise a family. We are building a strong economy, delivering jobs and growth and supporting our communities just to tackle the daily challenges that they have, including cost of living. We know that is happening right across Australia.

In relation to the environment and climate change, we have heard a bit more of the Greens catastrophising, of course, but let me just lay out some facts for the Chamber. We should all be immensely proud of our natural wonders in Tasmania. Our environment is, as I see it, some of the best in the world and it surrounds us even in our urban settings. That is why as a government we are strongly committed to its protection, not just for now but also into the future.

I have publicly announced our response to the State of the Environment report in December 2024, having tabled it in September 2024. I will quickly note that in the time that I have been Environment minister, the Greens have asked, I think, a total of one question to me as Environment minister. Is that correct? I am getting a nod. I think that is correct.

Mr Bayley - I do not know, but we have asked plenty of environment questions. We ask plenty of questions on the environment. We just ask them of different people.
Ms OGILVIE - No, I think you have asked me one. I am a bit surprised about that, as a party that cares so much about the environment.

Our response builds upon this significant and amazing work already underway. It recognises that protection of our environment requires continuous improvement into the future. We just have to get together on this. This is something where protest politics is not going to do it. It is divisive. We have to come together. We have to find those sweet spots where we can collaborate and make it work for the whole of Tasmania.

Mr Bayley - More terrestrial reserves, more marine reserves? Rejected.

Ms OGILVIE - I have done that with you, Mr Bayley, I hear you interjecting. I have come to you with things that we want to work together on and I have genuinely tried. I will continue to do that despite the rhetoric which I understand plays to your base. We are here to try and work together for the benefit of our environment, for the benefit of Tasmania, and for the benefit of our economy.

Some of the work already underway includes $8 million into our Threatened Species Fund to directly support conservation activities for priority species. This investment builds on existing work to support threatened species in Tasmania, including, importantly, $2.1 million to establish a captive breeding program for the maugean skate.

I have visited the Taroona facility. It was a fantastic day. I went there with some scientists and colleagues. The skates were quite amazing. When the lid opens on the tanks, they come up, because they are very curious creatures. They come up and look at you and you can see them, their little beaks. Particularly the little ones are very interesting creatures. It is going well.

There is $1 million into saving the swift parrot, $2.5 million to build the orange-bellied parrot captive breeding facility, which I have also visited. Such beautiful little birds; to see those little nestlings. Just a wonderful day. Ongoing funding to continue to save the Tasmanian Devil program as everybody would expect us to do. We will be revising the threatened species strategy, focusing effort on a contemporary framework for Tasmania to maximise conservation and recovery investment. That is due to come out this year.

It does not stop there. Another important way our government protects and manages our environment is through waste and resource recovery. The Tasmanian Waste and Resource Recovery Strategy, led by the Tasmanian Waste and Resource Recovery Board, sets our path for the next few years as we move to take advantage of the global shift to a circular and low emissions future. This strategy will help set us onto a sustainable pathway as we move to make our state a place where nothing is wasted.

Our long anticipated container refund scheme, Recycle Rewards, launches on 1 May 2025. Some people may have seen me out there celebrating some of the early milestones already. I was thrilled recently to visit a reverse vending machine installed last week at Cove Hill. Great day. Noting that drink containers make up to 45 per cent of Tasmania litter by volume, this scheme is good for the environment. It is good for Tasmanians. It will reduce pollution. It will reduce litter. It gives the kids - actually a couple of kids came up to us on their bikes, a nine-year-old and an 11-year-old. They were doing wheelies in the car park and they wanted to know what was going on. I explained to them that they could save up these plastic containers, they could go to their neighbours and collect them all up and make some money. They were thrilled and they went off to tell their friends as well. That was just a really nice little anecdote, a vignette. Our scheme aims to reduce the volume by half of that pollution I mentioned, to create new economic opportunities, new jobs, and turn drink containers into new recycled products.

We are also leading the nation in climate change action. Our state has provided significant investment of more than $250 million in climate change activities across government, which demonstrates our commitment to a coordinated response to climate change. We have amended the Climate Change Act 2008, which outlines a framework for a target of net zero emissions or lower from 2030. This is the most ambitious legislated emissions reduction target in the nation. In addition, we have delivered on our key actions under the act. I look forward to seeing further progress as the Climate Change Action Plan 2023-25 progresses.

I know we have heard a little bit about the Environment Protection Authority (EPA). I would like to state very clearly that the EPA is doing an independent statutory role. It is doing the job that we have asked it and funded it to do. It is my expectation that they will deliver environmental protection assessments and their approval functions in a way that meets community standards. It operates independently from government, and that is a good thing.

In relation to my personal particular portfolios and interests, I have innovation, science and the digital economy, which is a fantastic portfolio because it is about the future. It is about optimism. It is about new jobs. It is about innovation. It is about bringing Tasmania on the global journey in the same way that other states and territories in Australia are able to do. It is at the heart of Tasmania's economic future.

To secure that prosperous tomorrow, we want to inspire our children to learn, to innovate, to explore and to build a legacy through existing careers right here in Tasmania that can be taken up globally as well, in those opportunities right around the world. We need to create the right set of skilled people here at home, to grow the number of children studying, doing well at STEM, doing well at TAFE, university, straight into jobs with those skills, and to encourage entrepreneurship, industry and startups to inspire that next generation and position us as leaders on the world stage, which I know we can do.

High quality, reliable digital infrastructure is essential for providing those key services that not only the Tasmanian government delivers, but that will also underpin future economic growth in our state and make those businesses of the future very viable. We are committed to ensuring that our digital connectivity makes this state attractive to live in and do business. We want to reach out to the diaspora right across the world and say Tasmania is where it is at. There are really cool things happening here. We know this is true.

We want to secure future industry and provide global career opportunities for our young people all from right here in Tasmania. We know a lot of this is already happening, so we have something to work with. We have a base, and we can do more. 

In his speech, the Premier noted that entrepreneurs are the engine of our economy. He is quite right about that. Well said, I say. I would go further to say that innovators and entrepreneurs drive the engine room of our economy, and they drive government too. Process improvement, digitisation - those things that we need to do in government are really important. We have heard a lot about that through the previous speakers on our side.

Encouraging entrepreneurialism and innovation is at the heart of our ethos. It is actually at the heart of being Tasmanian. We have always done this as a state because we do not have the vast mineral resources of Western Australia, and we are not a financial centre like Sydney or New South Wales. We have to work with what we have. We have these assets. We have these niche areas that we do incredibly well in.

That is why as Minister for Innovation, Science and the Digital Economy, I am working collaboratively with industry, including UTAS, to ensure Tasmanians get the very best fit-for-purpose resources and opportunities to shine on the world stage. We need to celebrate that success.

We know that the pace of technological evolution and innovation continues to speed up. It is ramping up. AI, for example, is coming. It is an exciting time for Tasmania. In relation to AI, for instance, a topic which is becoming more and more relevant to Tasmania - and I am sure everybody has had a turn using it on their own phones and within their offices - but it does present a significant opportunity to boost productivity and enhance how we deliver services for the benefit of Tasmanian constituents.

Our government is embracing this potential responsibly. Ethics matters when it comes to AI in particular. We want a human in the loop. We have the Tasmanian AI guidelines which are aligned with the national framework. AI is a tool that complements human expertise, safely and securely, unlocking efficiencies that will strengthen our economy. We recognise that some people have concerns about this technology, but our tech sector is thriving, and with a strong foundation, workforce growth, revenue generation and government support, it is a key driver of our state's economic future. I am confident that they will chart the course appropriately.

We have had the 2024 Digital Pulse Report from the Australian Computer Society and Deloitte Access Economics showing Tasmania's tech workforce stands around 9600 people with a growth forecast of 4.7 per cent annually. That is pretty good. We work closely with industry to ensure that they can leverage rapid scientific and technological developments, keeping our sector in tip-top shape.

There is also the science and research sector which we are really proud to support. We invest in this sector. We invest in community engagement and industry growth initiatives, our STEM awards, Science Meets Parliament, participation in the Australian Chief Scientists Forum, our support for the Menzies Institute, and robust digital infrastructure to responsible AI adoption. We are creating jobs and lifting productivity.

In relation to Heritage, I too was very concerned about the clambering around on this beautiful heritage building yesterday. By all means, go out the front and protest. Everybody welcomes that, but please stay off our heritage roofs. We have enough challenges with them as it is.

There are a lot of key initiatives in the Heritage portfolio - $1.5 million annually over three years from 2023 to 2026 in built heritage funding and our grant scheme. Successful recipients often come up to me and say they could not have completed the project or done the work without the help that we had given them.

We have enhanced public access to the Tasmanian Heritage Register through the new Discovery Heritage Portal, allowing people to explore more, and we have got the data going. Tasmania's built heritage is more than just bricks and mortar. It is part of our identity. It is part of the Tasmanian brand. It is a key reason people come to visit us. The arts, as you know, is an integral part of Tasmania's cultural fabric. We have amazing artists here, the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra and others.

I will touch on one that I think is really interesting, intriguing, and fun. The Tasmanian Government introduced a $500,000 increase to support video game development in Tasmania to drive the industry to the next level. This led to the Level Up Tasmania Video Game Showcase, which was a unique opportunity. We got 2500 people there for the first event. It was remarkable. Such a great day. The industry day at the Theatre Royal was wonderful. Attendees had the opportunity to play 30 games from Tasmanian developers.

These Tasmanian developers are all over the planet as well, selling their games, teaching, particularly on the west coast of the USA. I get over there fairly regularly and I was happy to touch base with them recently as well.

Put more money into screen - Bay of Fires, Alone season 3. $1.5 million uplift to the arts also benefited organisations.

In relation to Corrections and Rehabilitation, I noticed or I listened, I think it was probably Mr Winter talking about change in strategy in relation to the Tasmanian prison system. We will talk to you about what we are doing very quickly. We are focused on delivering practical forward-thinking improvements to corrections across Tasmania, ensuring our facilities and services meet the needs of today and tomorrow. We are investing in infrastructure and technology to support both staff and prisoners while keeping public safety at the heart of all we do. At Risdon Prison, I am really delighted to see the new $21 million kitchen under construction. It is fantastic. I look forward to telling you more about that project.

Astra, which is rolling out in April 2025, is a prime example of productivity and process refinement and digitisation of systems that will make it easier for everybody to do their jobs and make it safer and more secure for everybody in the system. We have had a $38 million Carrera unit which will add 52 maximum security beds.

Importantly, the piece that I am really proud of because it leans into the new economy, digital technology, and that is our in-cell technology project. It is a practical step to bring education, support programs, and family contact right into cells, making rehabilitation more accessible while giving our staff better ways to connect with and manage prisoners. Imagine being able to speak to your lawyers when you need to, stay in touch with your family, do your orders online, and learn to have access to education on the screen in your cell. It is quite amazing.

I am running out of time. I will just say there is so much going on in Clark which I love. Every day I get up and I think I am just so honoured and lucky to be in this role. We all are. We must never forget that. The Glenorchy Pool is fantastic. The Queenborough Oval upgrade is amazing. The University of Tasmania: I will use my last few seconds on that. As a third generation UTAS grad, my son there at the moment will be a fourth generation UTAS grad, and we want Sandy Bay campus up and running for STEM and for the future generation of our children.

[4.35 p.m.]
Dr BROAD (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I stand tonight to give my reply to the state of the state address that the Premier gave yesterday. What is the state of the state? Well, I suppose it could be summarised in this way: debt, deficit, struggling services and a tired old Liberal minority government that is completely out of ideas. Now, why do I say that? Well, I listened to the Premier's address yesterday and you could see why he was probably lacking enthusiasm. I must admit, I could not help but laugh. I really probably should not openly laugh in this place, but I just could not help myself.

I have been around this place for a few years now, coming up to - I think I have ticked over eight years in this place. The reason why I was laughing is because there was absolutely nothing new. I have virtually heard this all before and it dawned on me that this speech was actually a cut and paste of state of the state speeches of the past. There were no new ideas. Basically, what the government was trying to do was hark back to Liberal governments of the past. I will go through the Premier's speech to give you a bit of an idea on why I could not help but laugh. 

Right off the bat, the Premier talked about a re-elected government with a fresh mandate. Right? What has this government actually got? They do not have a fresh mandate. They have a cobbled together minority government held together with sticky tape. What we have seen is that - even over the past week - we have Independents who are propping up this government, threatening to block supply, in fact. The member for Lyons, Mr Jenner, talked about blocking the budget. We had the member for Clark talk about giving up on her supply agreement. She obviously has had it with the government. Labor, being the sensible adult in the room, has talked about trying to give business confidence and not frivolously supporting no confidence motions because that is the state of this government. 

This government is teetering on the edge, and yet, the Premier talks about a re-elected government with a fresh mandate. Then he talked about a refreshed team. A refreshed team? Where is the refreshment in the team? What we have seen is one change. Mr Fairs has come into the parliament and that is the sole change. That is hardly a refreshed team. 

Then he talked about new ideas. There are no new ideas and I will be talking about that. Then the Premier started talking about things that are simply not true. You have only got to get a bit over half a dozen lines into his speech to see the first complete mistruth and that is, he said, 'We have delivered more than 4000 social and affordable homes'. This government has not delivered social and affordable homes under any measure. Not 4000 by any measure. It is complete nonsense. 

What they are actually doing is an accounting trick, and I have talked about this before. They are accounting absolutely everything from supported accommodation, homeless accommodation, land releases, ancillary dwellings, private rental incentives, rapid rehousing, absolutely everything, to get to their target. A promised 10,000 houses in 10 years and they say they have delivered 4000. It is complete nonsense. Absolute nonsense. Yet, instead of fudging and talking about social and affordable lots and homes, land releases is now actually any speech. He said, 'We have delivered more than 4000 social and affordable homes'. This is simply not true. That is in the first few minutes of this Premier's speech. How can you believe anything else he said after that?

Then he went on to say, 'Oh, you know what are we going to be doing? We are going to be making our planning system fairer, faster, cheaper and simpler'. What we have is a planning system that is more complex. I have talked in this place about the difference between building a house 10 years ago and building a house now. The amount of red tape that you have to go through is ridiculous. All the councils talk about how it is anything but fairer, faster, cheaper and simpler. So much so that the government is still talking about making our planning system fairer, faster, cheaper and simpler when they already promised to do that some 11 years ago. What a tired old government.

Then the Premier goes on and he talks about a report that found that it takes 37 licences to open a cafe in Tasmania and 26 licences to open a retail shop. If this was actually true, which I very much doubt, what nonsense? What has this government been doing in the last 11 years? If a cafe requires 37 licences and it has just dawned on the Premier that this is the case, why has he not done anything about it? It cannot be true: 37 licences. When you walk into a cafe, there are a couple of placards on the wall to highlight some of the things like food safety that they are responsible for. There are not 37 licences spread across the wall of every cafe. This is complete nonsense. 

What we hear from the government is complete nonsense all the time. What we heard about in the Premier's speech is that there is too much red tape. Businesses hate it. 'I agree', he says, 'So, we are taking a slasher to it'. Wow, a slasher to red tape. 'Over the coming weeks and months, we will be hunting down red tape and regulation that is blocking growth and removing it. 'This will not be a one-off blitz', he says, 'We are going to keep looking and keep ripping it down'. Wow. That is tough. I will turn your mind back. Some time ago there was a report - this is only one thing I have found, I am sure there are others - this was an article by our friend Becher Townshend in the Tasmanian Inquirer, way back when. I will read from it:

In his first week as Premier, Will Hodgman has sent a clear message to Tasmania and the rest of the nation that the state is again open for business.

He outlined his priorities. He sat down with Becher Townshend and outlined his priorities. One of the things he says is:

We have listened to the business community and developed a long-term plan to restore confidence, cut red and green tape, and encourage investment to build a modern economy supported by our competitive strengths to create jobs.

I think some of those lines are actually in this. Here we go. This is, I will remind everybody, 11 years ago:

Already we have commenced the process of establishing a planning reform taskforce which will have responsibility for establishing a single statewide planning scheme that is faster, simpler, fairer, and cheaper.

Yet, 11 years later, they have done a cut-and-paste, and they have inserted exactly the same language into the speech that the Premier gave yesterday. That is embarrassing. They also appointed a regulation reduction coordinator to start work on cutting red and green tape that strangles businesses. It was 11 years ago that they appointed a regulation reduction coordinator to start cutting red and green tape. You wind the clock forward 11 years - and if you believe the Premier, 37 licences required just to open a cafe. What have they been doing?

That was not the only time they had a crack at red tape. They have had a red tape reduction coordinator, who has been producing reports and so on, and indeed even this year has produced a report. Way back in 2017, I saw the press release where Elise Archer was promoted to Cabinet - remember Ms Archer? In 2017, a parliamentary secretary for red tape reduction was appointed. In 2017, you even had a parliamentary secretary for red tape reduction, and yet here we are in 2025 and red tape is still at the top of this Premier's to-do list. What a joke. What an absolute joke. 'This will not be a one-off blitz', he says. Yes - it has been 11 years of sitting on his hands. That is what it has actually been.

Do not just take our word for it. There was a press release from Robert Mallett from the Tasmanian Small Business Council, just today, 5 March. It said:

The Premier's example of requiring 37 separate licences simply to open a café was stark, and highlights the bureaucratic tangle of red tape we are drowning under. 

But then he goes to say:

But, to some extent, we have heard all of this before, and the proof will be in pudding as to whether the Government actually does effectively reduce the red tape burden on small business.

There you go.

We look forward to working closely with the Government to bring the dream of less red tape, and more effective bureaucracy to reality.

The dream of less red tape. There it is. That is the reality. They are dreaming. They are absolutely dreaming. Here we are, Premier. I could not help but laugh. This was simply embarrassing.

Then we went on to further complete nonsense that the Premier talked about, trying to justify the indefensible. What he said was:

Labor left a debt legacy when they were voted out in 2014. Under the Liberals, that debt burden was lifted.

This is just not true. Absolutely not true on any measure. When we left government in 2014, there was zero debt. If zero debt is a legacy, then we are proud of it, proud of the legacy of leaving this Liberal government with no debt. 'Under the Liberal governments, that debt burden has been lifted' - that debt burden has been lifted, it has been lifted towards $10 billion of debt. That is the legacy of this government. We left them with zero debt and now we are approaching $10 billion.

It is clear that they are getting absolutely desperate, but what does debt mean? Maybe the people of Tasmania do not understand what $10 billion of debt means. What it actually means is that the government has to make serious repayments - half a billion dollars a year and so on.
That means that we have less money to spend on other things. It also means that you are in a debt spiral because they are borrowing to repay the debt. It only ends one way. We know that the credit rating agencies have given Tasmania a credit downgrade. They have said that it is a negative outlook.

Also, importantly, it gives the government much less flexibility in an uncertain world. We have got a government in the US under Trump putting tariffs on everything, which could have an impact on businesses in Tasmania. This is debt spiral that we are under, yet the government tries to pick a stat that says that our debt level is manageable.

They have said the lowest level of debt-to-revenue of all states. That may or may not be true. The thing that the Premier is not talking about is the trajectory of the debt. This debt is growing at such a rapid rate, record deficits, and it is going pear shaped very quickly and that is why the ratings agencies have given Tasmania a significant warning. Then he says he is not going to slash and he is going to talk about a sensible pathway to surplus and there is absolutely no evidence of that.

He goes on to the language of we need a State Service to be in quotes 'right size' and we heard the Treasurer, Mr Barnett, talk about that as well. The number that they have given us is they need to get rid of 2500 public servants. A hiring freeze is not going to reduce the State Service by 2500 people. What does 2500 people actually look like in the State Service?

We can have a debate about what is frontline and what is not frontline. For example, in Police, Fire and Emergency Management there are about 1100 people. There are about 900 in State Growth. There are about 330 in the Department of Treasury and Finance. These figures I have are from the start of 2024. It would probably be a little bit different.

If you wanted to get rid of 2500 public servants, you could get rid of that entire department, Police, Fire and Emergency Management, State Growth, Treasury and Finance. If they did not exist anymore, then that would be 2500 people. That is the quantum that you are actually looking for.

Education has about 8700 and the Health department has about 1200. Let us just pretend for a moment that everybody in Health and Education and Police, Fire and Emergency Management, and maybe Justice are actually frontline staff. To get to the 2500 figure, everyone else would have to go. Every other department. It is just absolute nonsense. We keep on going on.

The Premier talked about where there is duplication, inefficiency and waste:

We need to make sure that every state service job is effective and as productive as possible …

What are they actually talking about there?

… and look at ways to streamline and improve services, including by using digital technology to replace paper-based and manual processes.

Now that sounds really good. There was a program in the Health department worth about $150 million, from memory, to upgrade their IT systems. That would have created efficiencies, got rid of the paper-based problems. People would have been more productive. What happened to that $150 million? From what I understand, it went into operating. They canned that project.

Then the Premier went into what I would call high farce when his speech became a complete joke. He talked about the government business enterprises:

The challenge we faced with the Spirits raises the important question about what businesses the government should own. I believe to answer that we need to return to first principles …

and ask questions about whether these GBEs should be in public or private hands.

The government completely stuffing up the Spirits - forgetting that they needed somewhere to load and unload these new Spirits - would have to be the dumbest excuse for an asset fire sale that any government has ever come up with. Imagine that: you have a government that has basically admitted they are so incompetent they have spent a billion dollars on ships with nowhere to park them. As a result they have to sell the family jewels. What a complete joke. Absolute shocker. This is where they really go into the playbook of past Liberal governments. Remember the last Liberal government and what they did with their privatisation agenda? The government has learned that they cannot sell the Hydro, but they are going to try to sell just about everything else. Remember some of the things the last Liberal government did that caused massive problems for subsequent governments? 

The last Liberal government sold the Queen Alex in Hobart - that section of the hospital that created no end of trouble. They privatised the Burnie hospital and that created no end of trouble. To be able to build a car park or to build a cancer centre at the Burnie site, a Labor government had to buy it back. What did they do? They raided trust funds. They completely blew the budget. Then they tried to sell Hydro. Well, this government learnt that trying to sell the Hydro is not a very good idea but now what they are trying to do is put everything else up for sale. It is not just GBEs that are up for sale. They have flagged a wider agenda than just the GBEs when the Premier in his speech talks about the Land Titles Office. Does the Land Titles Office really need to be owned by the government? Where could this end?

Where could this end? Could it be that Service Tasmania gets privatised? Could it be any other department privatised? State Growth privatised? Who knows where this government is going to start and end? No wonder public servants around Tasmania are quaking in their boots. Then the Premier talks about walking both sides of the road when he says these measures would benefit the budget bottom line. This privatisation agenda is to cover up complete incapacity for this government to manage a budget.

What would they do? Then the Premier says they will pay down debt. Pay down debt. Then, down the speech a couple of lines, he said 'We will look to invest the proceeds of any change of ownership in a sensible pathway to a surplus future fund'. He has called it the Sensible Pathway Surplus Future Fund, all in capitals like that is what it is going to be called. A few lines before that he said he was going to use it to pay off debt. Now he is trying to fudge it by talking about some offset account. That is what this government has come to.

They are starting to talk about an offset account. This is just completely ridiculous. How is it that something like the Motor Accidents Insurance Board (MAIB) could be sold? How much return on investment would this new future fund get, compared to the rivers of gold that the MAIB has delivered this state government over the past five or six years? No way known, but that is what we have got with this government. No new ideas - harking back to a Liberal government of the past. The Liberal governments of the past - exactly what this government is doing. They have absolutely wrecked the budget and now they are having to start the idea of flogging off state assets. The Tasmanian public has seen this movie before and what happened last time is they absolutely took the baseball bats to the Liberal government at that next election. That is what we are working towards.

It was great to hear our leader, Dean Winter. He did not just talk about the issues. As we have done before, he talked about some of the solutions that this government should be looking at such as shared services across agencies to reduce duplication, terminating outsource contracts, acting consultants, tasking Treasury, not some Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) or whatever new format you are going to come up with to identify failed programs and so on and so forth. That is what this government should be doing. We have given them some ideas. Take up some of them. Otherwise we are going to head into what is a budget catastrophe and it is a catastrophe of this government's own making. 

Time expired.

Mrs PETRUSMA (Franklin - Minister for Health) – Honourable Speaker, I am delighted to rise this afternoon on the Premier's address and to congratulate and thank the Premier for his speech yesterday, which laid out a strong pathway forward for Tasmania.

The year 2014 might seem like a long time ago, but when you look back and compare to where we are now, it is so obvious just how far Tasmania has come and just how much our government has delivered. For example, if I look at my own portfolio of Health, we have delivered new infrastructure such as K Block at the Royal Hobart Hospital, a new helipad at the Launceston General Hospital, a new antenatal clinic at the North West Regional Hospital, and a new operating theatre at the Mersey Community Hospital. We have hired more nurses, doctors and paramedics. We have turned our economy around which, as the Premier references, everyone knows allowed us to get through the pandemic.

I know the opposition does not like us talking about it, but these are the things that matter to Tasmanians. I am proud to be part of a government that is improving our state. We know that there is still more to do. With parliament returning for another year, we are getting on with the job of delivering our plan that we took to the election just under one year ago.

It is a true honour to stand here today as the Minister for Health, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Minister for Veterans Affairs. I first acknowledge all my wonderful ministerial and electorate staff, each of whom work exceptionally hard to support me and our government in delivering our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future. From the bottom of my heart, a huge thank you to you all.

I also thank our departmental staff and the Department of Health, Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania and the Department of Premier and Cabinet, who are so invaluable with their advice and support.

On the topic of staff, I recognise the incredible contributions of our hardworking healthcare professionals on the ground and personally thank our doctors, nurses, midwives, paramedics and healthcare workers across our state for their tremendous efforts in caring for Tasmanians. Having worked in the Tasmanian Health Service, I greatly appreciate the outstanding work that our healthcare workers do in supporting our community. It certainly does not go unnoticed. It is very much appreciated.

I want to assure all of you that we are committed to supporting you so that we do have the workforce to deliver the healthcare that Tasmanians need. This includes our commitment to delivering even more healthcare professionals, with our biggest ever recruitment blitz well underway for Tasmania's newest doctors, nurses, midwives, paramedics and allied health professionals. This is clearly delivering results with over 2483 healthcare workers employed since April last year.

These are not just numbers. These are people on the ground which means that there are now more healthcare staff delivering more services around Tasmania who are helping Tasmanians in the community right now. Healthcare staff are making a real, tangible difference in people's lives because at the end of the day, that is what truly matters. We are investing billions in healthcare and infrastructure, including expanding and upgrading all major hospitals. We are delivering more than 50,000 outpatient appointments on average every month, which is 10,000 more than in 2014. We are delivering more elective surgeries than ever before with record amounts performed for two consecutive years, almost 60 surgeries a day on average.

We are also investing record amounts into our health system, more than any other government in Tasmania's history. We will continue to do so with $12.9 billion invested across the forward Estimates, which equals $8.8 million every single day. As the Premier said, the reason we can continue our record investment into our health system is because we are delivering a strong economy. That is exactly what we will continue to provide in the years ahead to ensure that we can maintain this momentum.

While I could talk about our record investment, recruitment and services in health all day long, sometimes the best thing we can do to help Tasmanians is to find innovative ways to do things better and more effectively, as the Premier referenced in his speech. This includes a new optional accelerated pathway for highly experienced enrolled nurses who are commencing as graduate registered nurses; the pathway to transition to the role of a registered nurse is now available after just three months for experienced enrolled nurses who want this option and have strong competency in acute care.

I also acknowledge and recognise the outstanding contribution, strong advocacy and dedication of our nurse practitioners in delivering high-quality healthcare in Tasmania. With Tasmania's current GP challenges - thanks to the federal government's chronic underinvestment in primary care, along with our ageing population and care for patients with complex medical needs becoming more of a challenge - the need for nurse practitioners with an expanded scope of practice, appropriately supported by Medicare, has never been greater. I am truly pleased that the Scope of Practice Review undertaken last year by Prof Mark Cormack recommends reforms to remove the barriers that impede health practitioners, including nurse practitioners, from working to their full scope of practice.

I strongly support increasing the scope of practice for our nurse practitioners and the expansion of Medicare so that our nurse practitioners can deliver more medical services to the community. I have written and spoken to the federal Health Minister, Mark Butler, about our support for this expansion of scope and will continue to advocate strongly for the necessary changes so that our very well-credentialed nurse practitioners can provide the care our community expects and deserves.

We are also playing our part at a state level to remove the barriers and to cut red tape for nurse practitioners, such as the Justice and Related Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 2025, currently undergoing public consultation. This will enable nurse practitioners to issue workers compensation medical certificates in the emergency department. The Department of Health is also currently drafting a Nurse Practitioner's Workforce Strategy and supporting documentation to assist nurse practitioners to work to their full scope of practice, through identifying the barriers and enabling managers to plan for expansion of the nurse practitioners workforce and to support service delivery.

With regard to excellence in service delivery, I also want to touch on the great work of Ambulance Tasmania, what they are doing for those who need emergency care, and the ways that we are supporting them. We have already started employing our 78 new full-time paramedics, including 27 community paramedics who will be located at our district hospitals right around Tasmania. This expansion addresses the growing demand for emergency services and ensures that our communities have timely access to life-saving care. Since becoming minister, it has been fantastic travelling around the state and meeting our incredible paramedics, communication centre staff and volunteers over the last four months. I greatly appreciate their passion, dedication and professionalism; supporting Tasmanians in their time of need.

Since 2014, we have also committed to building or upgrading 16 new ambulance stations to ensure we are providing contemporary facilities that can cater to the community's healthcare needs now and into the future. This includes new state-of-the-art ambulance stations in Burnie, Glenorchy, Beaconsfield, Bridgewater, Queenstown, Campbell Town and Oatlands. We have significantly improved Latrobe, Smithton and Dodges Ferry ambulance stations. Work is also underway to deliver new ambulance stations at Bicheno, Longford, Snug, Cygnet, Legana and King Island. This investment is all about supporting our workforce, enhancing our response times and ensuring that our hardworking, dedicated paramedics are well-equipped and ready to respond.

One of our major commitments, which the Premier referenced in his speech, is all about ensuring our paramedics are in the community where they belong and not stuck at a hospital. I am sure everyone in this place remembers when we announced our intention to end ramping and the scepticism that arose. In fact, we were the only party at last year's state election to put forward a solution for ramping. As the Premier said, the facts on ramping are indisputable. Our policy is working. So far, this financial year, our ambulances have spent over 11,500 less hours ramped in the six months from July to December last year, compared to the same period in 2023. That means, in just six months, 11,500 more hours were available for our paramedics to be providing life-saving care in the community. This is just fantastic and a great result for Tasmanians. To reinforce what the Premier said, the amount of time that paramedics are spending at hospitals is down from almost 60 minutes in April 2024 to just 39 minutes in December 2024.

These are not just numbers, these are real, quantifiable improvements that are making a massive difference in the lives of Tasmanians. I am proud to be part of a government that has delivered this outstanding reform. While we know there will be fluctuations day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year, we will continue to take a measured approach on our way to the national best practice benchmark of 30 minutes.
We are also continuing work on improving health outcomes for women. It was fantastic to open the third permanent BreastScreen clinic in Rosny in November 2024. This has allowed BreastScreen to expand access to services in southern Tasmania and to free up statewide capacity for mobile screening units to visit more rural and regional locations throughout the year. I would like to thank the great team at BreastScreen Tasmania for their inspiring efforts in providing screening to Tasmanian women. We are also progressing with the new Diagnostic Breast Imaging Centre in Hobart, with tenders called for in early February. This service is expected to start taking patients at the end of this year.

Having previously been on the Select Committee on Reproductive, Maternal and Paediatric Health Services in Tasmania, I have some understanding of the barriers that expecting mothers can face. I am very committed to doing all that I can to ensure we are providing the best possible care to women before, during and after pregnancy and birth. This was demonstrated just last week when, following Healthscope's very disappointing announcement that they are closing their maternity services in six months, we acted quickly to obtain a funding commitment from the federal government. This will not only boost capacity at Calvary and the Royal Hobart Hospital and provide new equipment, but will also allow us to move our mother-baby unit or provide an intensive parenting support service at St John's Park in New Town, to provide more holistic care for mothers experiencing postnatal challenges.

Speaking of challenges, I want to touch on the primary care sector. As we have made quite clear time and time again, GPs are the responsibility of the federal government, but we have been forced as a state government to step in time and time again where the federal government has failed. While we welcome the recent pre-election commitments by both Labor and the Coalition to increase Medicare funding and rebates and the delivery of more urgent care clinics, we have been calling for these for over a year now, so they need to be implemented as a priority. 

As a result of having to continually step up where the federal government has failed, we are now spending over $41 million and counting to support primary care initiatives in Tasmania to ensure Tasmanians can access a GP. We are not spending this because we are obliged to, because this is a federal government responsibility. We do call on the support of all members of this House to make sure that their federal government representatives do pay their fair share. The federal government has let Tasmanians down. If we do not stand up, no-one else will. That $41 million could have delivered a lot more elective surgery and outpatient appointments for Tasmanians in need.

Furthermore, on top of the $41 million, there is also the shortfall in federal funding support for our public hospitals. This is why we continue to call on the Commonwealth to increase its contribution to health funding to the level it should be paying. Currently, the Commonwealth is not paying its full 45 per cent contribution that it is supposed to. This means that Tasmania will miss out on more than $1.3 billion over the next six financial years. That is over $200 million every single year, and that is on top of the $476 million we have already missed out on over the 10-year period from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2025.

It is simply not good enough. Rather than people keeping on raising issues with the Tasmanian state government with regard to our health system, I urge all members to get on board team Tasmania and join us in demanding that we get our fair share of federal government funding.
I would like to now speak about my portfolio of Aboriginal Affairs. I am delighted and honoured to once again be the minister for this important portfolio that really touches my heart and touches my soul. I greatly appreciate Aboriginal Affairs' importance in delivering better outcomes for Tasmania's Aboriginal people. I believe it is so vital that we continue to do all that we can to close the gap and achieve meaningful change for Tasmania's Aboriginal people.

I highly value the very meaningful and forthright discussions I have had over these last few months with Tasmania's Aboriginal people and the organisations that represent them. This includes visiting Cape Barren Island to hear firsthand from their community about their challenges and how we can help. I have also been fortunate to go on country with Tasmanian Aboriginal people this year to witness and to learn more about their deep cultural heritage and to experience traditions that have been passed down through generations. It has truly reinforced to me the importance of genuine dialogue and true partnership in shaping a better future for Tasmania's Aboriginal people.

We know that we need to do more to close the gap. We are working hard to finalise Tasmania's second Closing the Gap Implementation Plan which builds on the foundations of trust and capacity. This new plan has been shared with Tasmanian Aboriginal organisations a few times now for their feedback and input, because it is a working document. I am looking forward to releasing it soon.

Another key focus for 2025 is delivering practical outcomes to empower Tasmania's Aboriginal people, and to strengthen cultural heritage protection. This includes developing new, stronger, proactive Aboriginal cultural heritage protection legislation. This is a complex piece of work which we are working through carefully and methodically with a lot of stakeholders, to ensure that we do have the best possible legislation that will adequately protect our invaluable Aboriginal heritage.

With regard to Veterans' Affairs, it is such an honour taking on this portfolio from the Deputy Premier, who made such a significant contribution to this portfolio while he was the minister.

Mr Barnett - Thank you.

Mrs PETRUSMA - I also pay tribute to all of our veterans who have defended our freedoms, upheld our values and protected our way of life. I also pay tribute to the Veterans' Reference Group. They provide valuable insight into the issues faced by the over 17,500 veterans and defence personnel in Tasmania, and advice on how we can do better to support them.

It has been such a pleasure visiting our veteran organisations across the state over the last few months, including RSL Tasmania. On that note, I congratulate RSL Tasmania and their CEO, John Hardy, for being awarded $1.8 million as part of the Veterans' Acute Housing Program Tasmania. This is a fantastic outcome, as veterans are three times more likely to experience homelessness than the general population, and this funding will directly support veterans and their families who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness.

RSL Tasmania is certainly doing inspiring work through the implementation of Veteran Hub right across Tasmania. This is a really exciting initiative and the first of its kind in Australia to deliver services statewide. I congratulate the fabulous team at RSL Tasmania for all of their hard work and effort and I look forward to visiting more of the Veteran Hubs statewide as they progress.

As a government, as a community and as a state, I believe we all have a duty to ensure our veterans receive the support, recognition and opportunities they deserve and that is why we are delivering real, meaningful initiatives to improve the lives of veterans and their families across Tasmania. The Veteran Employment Strategy is one key pillar of our commitment. With over 17,500 veterans and ex-serving personnel in Tasmania, we recognise the immense knowledge, skills and experiences that they all bring to our community and to our economy.

This Veteran Employment Strategy will create clear pathways for veterans to transition into civilian roles, ensuring that their military skills and their experiences are fully recognised and valued. We are also making improvements to the Veteran Wellbeing Voucher Program, ensuring that veterans can access a broad range of health and wellbeing services right across Tasmania.

We are also making key changes designed to improve the program to make it easier for veterans and their families to access it. First, we are making it easier for veterans to access vouchers with applications for the voucher program now available at Service Tasmania centres right across the state. This is an important step in recognising and responding to the needs of those who have given so much in service to our country.

It might sound like a small thing, but by making applications available now in person, we are ensuring that no veteran is left behind due to digital access issues or complex processes. It means that veterans can receive direct assistance, clarify eligibility, and even collect their vouchers on the spot, removing unnecessary stress and making it easier to access the benefits, which is being very well received.

We are also working on increasing our support to the families of veterans by expanding the Veteran Wellbeing Voucher Program to also include widows and partners of veterans. This change will ensure widows and partners of veterans who hold a Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) pension concession card can receive the same support as their veteran partner, helping them to also stay active and connected.

Widows and partners of veterans are a vital part of our Tasmanian veteran community and this will ensure that they can access opportunities that support their physical and their mental health, to help build social connections and to improve their overall quality of life.

We know that sport and active recreation are proven to boost mental wellbeing, physical health and social inclusion, all of which are critical for those navigating life after significant change. Department of Premier and Cabinet (DPAC) are actively looking at how this can be implemented and I will have more to say on this in the coming weeks and months.

Likewise, supporting veteran organisations is also a priority. This is why round two of the Teddy Sheean VC Memorial Grants Program providing up to $50,000 for ex-service organisations and clubs is now open. This funding will go towards essential projects including minor capital works, equipment, wellbeing initiatives and memorial upgrades. Applications are open now and will close on the 18 March 2025, with the successful recipients announced before Anzac Day.
This program is also a fitting tribute to the legacy of Teddy Sheean VC and a reminder of our commitment to those who have served. Through these initiatives we are delivering real progress to ensure Tasmanian veterans are supported, because when we support our veterans, we strengthen our entire community.

In closing, it has been fantastic getting out and about right across our state over the last four months and meeting everyone in my portfolios. I am really looking forward to delivering on all our commitments during our fourth term of government. I also reiterate my support for what the Premier said and reaffirm my commitment to work with all my might every day to make Tasmania an even better place in which to live, work and raise a family.

[5.15 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, Tasmania is in financial peril. We are at a tipping point and if we do not act sensibly right now, it is going to be very hard to recover a sustainable budget in the future. This government has its head in the sand, ignoring the experts' advice or at best cherry-picking advice to suit its ideological agenda. Instead of delivering for Tasmania and for Tasmanians, it is turning to lazy popular strategies that will not fix the problems of its own making. If these strategies are the product of its so-called refreshed team and new ideas, then we are in very deep trouble. 

Why do I say we are at a tipping point?  Over the last 10 years, Tasmania's health outcomes have worsened, as has our healthcare performance, with the worst ambulance response times in the country, the worst self-assessed health in the country, the lowest life expectancy in the country and the second highest rate of potentially avoidable deaths in the country.

Our education outcomes are also among the worst in the country. Apart from promising signs that evidence-based industries are having success, our retention and year 12 attainment rates have barely shifted. There are more people on the housing register now than ever before and they are waiting longer for a safe roof over their heads. Tasmania is failing to make progress it needs on closing the gap to reduce disadvantage of Tasmanian Aboriginal people and our participation rate is still the lowest in the country. 

As well as our people, we are not investing in the right places in our built and natural environment, with the lowest per capita spending on public transport. After waiting years for an overdue report on the environment, there is clear evidence we are not doing what we need to prevent crises of misuse and our species extinction, with the state of the environment report warning of escalating environmental challenges and 16 out of 29 areas declining, all while this government has repeatedly told us that under its watch, the Tasmanian economy is doing better than ever.

You have to ask them: what is the point of a strong economy if not to improve the lives of its people and to ensure we protect our environment for generations to come? Well, for this government, seeking to preserve its power seems to be the priority. Just look at where it directs so much of our taxpayers' dollars. Instead of investing on these wellbeing and productivity initiatives, we have seen millions, if not billions regularly wasted on corporate welfare. Think, racing industry subsidies; AFL subsidies; stadiums; salmon industries; free leases; mining industries, making private companies pay more for profiting on public land and resource; developers; money to deliver projects where they deliver anyway because they make money, and any other number of examples. For instance, footing the $600,000 marketing bill for a luxury Three Capes walk in Tasmania's national parks, owned by two wealthy mainlanders.

Buying into a failing tungsten mine to the tune of $10 million and gifting their developer mates $12 million to build a chocolate fountain. The list goes on. It is no surprise then, that we have people, particularly young Tasmanians, leaving the state in droves. Some people with whom I have discussed a tipping point disagree. They say we are not at the tipping point. They think we have well gone beyond that and fallen off the cliff. Whichever side of the tipping point you think we are at, either at the top or over the tipping point, the Premier's announcements in his state of the state speech yesterday are not going to make things better. They are not what this state needs to repair the budget or reassure Tasmanians this government is prioritising their well-being and that of the state as a whole. 

What has the government announced instead? The government's response is worse than putting its head in the sand on budget repair. What the Premier announced yesterday will make things far worse. On top of the very urgent and serious work the public service is undertaking, like the response to the commission of inquiry, the crucial work on closing the gap, reform to bring children out of Ashley, the government is now introducing populist policies that will ironically tie up the public service in useless bureaucratic tasks to work out who is and who is not an essential worker and what are essential and non-essential regulations and programs. They want to sell off our public assets in a desperate and misguided attempt to fix the budget.

These proposals are actually worse than useless. They will make Tasmanians less safe and add to their cost-of-living pressures. The language the Premier uses might be different, but the echoes of Donald Trump's attack on federal workers sounds an alarm for all of us, as evidenced by the Premier's creation of his own DOGE, the efficiency and productivity unit.

The Treasurer cannot even say who is a non-essential worker. Is it the unit coordinator in child safety, secured as part of an emergency workforce package to relieve admin duties of child safety officers so they can focus on their core work to help with the retention crisis? It is an administrative role, but an essential one if we are to support our child safety workforce. What about the school administration officer? Some schools are being forced to hire teacher assistants, but they are doing admin duties because they can only get approval for school admin officers. How many children are missing out on essential support to learn as a result? 

What about the parks and wildlife work up on the west coast? There was a substantive backline office role that steps into an incident management control role and directs fire fighting when it is needed. Any or all of the backline jobs hired as a result of the commission of inquiry. Are these non-essential workers? We do not know. 

There is a real risk that in following the government's direction, government departments will find themselves with not enough people to do the work that still needs doing, so they will be forced to hire consultants or outsource at multiple times the cost of public service employees.

The other more alarming risk is the progress being made across the public service thanks to engaging knowledgeable and highly skilled workers to make state institutions more child safe will be undermined. Children in particular will be less safe as a result.

The government's other big ticket idea was selling off public assets. This is another cheap, lazy stunt that will cause more problems than it will solve. Once an asset is sold, it has gone. We are not getting it back. A fire sale only happens once. Some of these assets actually generate revenue for the government. Why sell them? Whoever buys those assets will do so expecting they will earn a profit. What does the Premier think that means for prices? They will go up, of course. The Premier is about to take us down a path of rising prices for many essentials - electricity, transport, claiming the title on your new house, for example.

One could be mistaken for thinking they have run some of these assets into the ground to give them an excuse to sell them off - Metro, the Public Trustee - but, of course, we will talk about that later in the year, I am sure.

Yet another echo of the Trump/Musk playbook, the Premier has also announced a red tape blitz, presumably at the bidding of his corporate mates who want to make money through less regulation - the efficiency and productivity unit. Guess what that means? It means fewer protections for the environment, safety for workers, and more gifting of public land and resources to private interests.

For all this focus on wasteful spending, the one area with massive potential for savings did not even rate a mention: the millions and millions of government dollars spent on corporate welfare. To sum up, the Premier's state of the state address shows this government has no imagination and no real commitment to improve Tasmania's dire economic, environmental and social situation. What does the evidence tell us we need? For our people, we need more investment in prevention to keep people well, mentally and physically, to support them, to keep engaging and learning when life throws up barriers, investments to stop people from being forced into homelessness and to support people into meaningful, secure work that allows them a dignified life. For our environment, it means significant investment to protect our ecosystems and address the threats from climate change.

For our budget, Saul Eslake has laid out a comprehensive suite of measures to get the budget onto a sustainable footing - increasing taxes, reducing operating expenditure, reducing capital expenditure and asset sales. Of these, Eslake said increasing taxes and reducing capital expenditure were preferred over the others because our taxes are relatively low compared to other jurisdictions and certainly, we tax mining and other industries far less than we could or should. Tasmania's infrastructure spending is unsustainable, and reducing operating expenditure would inevitably impact on Tasmanians who rely on services provided by the government and because asset sales are a one off hit, higher probability acquirers of those businesses would be based on the mainland, so it could lead to job losses in Tasmania and could mean losing revenue generating assets.

I believe there are clear priorities to get the budget back on sustainable footing and improve the lives of Tasmanians now and into the future. Fund the public service to deliver services and safeguards Tasmanians need, scale back infrastructure spending to an affordable limit and prioritise projects that manifestly deliver good social and economic outcomes for Tasmanians, unlike the proposed stadium, and end corporate welfare to industries that do not deliver a positive return on investment to Tasmanians, animals or the environment.

I fundamentally disagree with the Premier's statement in his speech that people want government out of their lives - well, sure, if those people are the ones the Premier is talking to and his government listens to, people who want to be free to rip out our minerals and our native forests, pollute our rivers and coastal ways and take public land for private profit with no responsibility for the state we leave for our future generations, then that is who he is clearly listening to. The people in my community, right across the electorate of Clark, income earners high to low, the well-educated and the less so, politically engaged or not, are quite clear about the key role they want government to play in their lives. Let me assure you, they do not want government out of their lives - quite the opposite, in fact.

They want the government to invest in mental healthcare for their kids. They want the government to provide affordable housing and help get the growing numbers of people experiencing homelessness off the street. They want the government to invest in our public schools so teachers can get on with the job of teaching and students can get on with the job of learning. They want the government to make sure that our waterways, forests, beaches and mountains will be kept beautiful for their children's children. They want the government to manage the budget responsibly so we can all enjoy these things for generations to come. These are all very reasonable and, you have to agree, basic functions of the government.

If it is not delivering these things, then what the hell is it going to do? It is borrowing from the Trump/Musk playbook and doing the bidding of its corporate donor mates. Tasmania and Tasmanians will suffer. I assure the Premier that judging by the backlash across the United States and the globe at Trump's reckless and self-interested actions, it will not go well for him. Tasmanians will push back. You can mark my words.

[5.28 p.m.]
Mrs BESWICK (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I welcome the chance to respond to the Premier's state of the state address and share some of my thoughts on issues affecting the lives of Tasmanians. It is a privilege I could not have imagined this time last year when I was in the midst of my whirlwind of the first election campaign. While I was determined to represent my community, being elected to this parliament is something I will never take for granted. It has been an eye-opening first 12 months, to say the least.

I have witnessed some moments in this House that have been truly moving, members using their voice to advocate for Tasmanians and the changes that will legitimately improve lives. We all come to this place with our own unique life experiences. We all have our tribes, the people we feel compelled to support, including the newest MP in this House, and I congratulate and welcome the member for Lyons, Mr Farrell, on his election. Good timing, as he is walking in the room.

As an independent, I feel very fortunate to be able to stand up for the things close to my heart. My first year as an MP was a rollercoaster ride, but having survived, and with the incredible support of my friend and colleague, the member for Bass, I start this year with a renewed determination to deliver positive outcomes for my beautiful electorate and the people who call the north-west and west coast home. My office in Devonport is becoming increasingly busy and I urge anyone who needs assistance with something big or small to come and visit me or contact my team.

Our state is facing some serious challenges that will require mature responses. Improving the health of the budget is one of the most pressing. The cost of servicing the four-plus debt is climbing. It goes without saying that this money could be better spent on delivering essential services.

Taking on some debt to finance important infrastructure projects is one thing, but the government is relying far too heavily on the credit card to maintain the current spending. It is unsustainable and it must be addressed immediately. The report delivered by Saul Eslake, which I have been proud to make part of our original agreement with the Premier, has attracted broad support and admiration. I have been intrigued to hear the Premier's plan for budget reform set out in his state of the state of speech. This did not correspond with the government's formal response for Mr Eslake's work, which showed an unwillingness to really consider any of his suggestions. It was pleasing to hear that some consideration of Mr Eslake's recommendations are now being considered, despite the complete refusal to consider any increase to revenue.

I understand the politics at play. Increasing taxes or making some fundamental shifts in revenue systems is a hard sell, but leadership does not mean kicking the can down the road.

I would like to see Saul Eslake's ideas modelled by Treasury so we can have a proper debate about their value to the budget. Tax reform should not be constantly put in the political too-hard basket, especially when net debt is about to soar beyond $10 billion.

I urge both sides of the House to engage in genuine conversation about how we can make Tasmania more sufficient. In creating self-sufficiency, I believe we can focus on strategies to reduce barriers and improve access to employment, delivering increases in productivity and GSP: services like the Community Transport Area Connect program which support travel to work where public transport is not available or increasing childcare centres and reducing red tape for family daycare.

As I have stated before, I love strategy and I love improving things. The Premier's promise to attack red tape through a microscope of red legislation is music to my ears. That is what I am here to champion. I do not love all the government suggestions as to how this is to occur. I remain a sceptic of Development Assessment Panels (DAPs) and I believe we should be looking at other ways to attack the problems when it comes to planning. I promise the Tasmanian people that I will investigate and drill each piece of legislation. I look forward to red tape days and unpacking government business reforms.

Reforming government businesses and selling them are two very different things. The Premier has a massive task in convincing Tasmanians that privatisation is in the state's best interests. While I will remain of an open mind, the initial reaction shows the public has a natural aversion to selling off state-owned assets.

The challenges facing Tasmania are not unique. The cost of providing healthcare to an ageing population is going up right across Australia. Each year, we underestimate how much we need to spend on health and inevitably need to inject additional funds into this budget. Despite this, the Treasurer has not factored these likely cost blowouts into the forward Estimates, which makes the path back to anywhere near a surplus even more unlikely. We are about to vote on an additional half a billion dollars overspend in just this year alone.

No-one is claiming that addressing the Health budget is an easy task, but some obvious challenges need our attention. The cost of employing locum doctors, agency nurses and the reliance on overtime cannot be ignored. We must find ways to attract and retain permanent health staff. The government has introduced market allowances to help fill some specialist positions. It appears to be a strategy that produces results. I encourage the Health minister to identify other positions that could benefit from similar incentives. Our rates of pay, including our super and long service leave provisions, need to be competitive with other states but also with jobs in the private sector. Yes, it could mean a higher rate of pay for permanent staff, but if that offsets our reliance on locums and overtime, it would soon pay for itself.

On Sunday, the Treasurer revealed he is implementing a hiring freeze on non-essential jobs. My husband and I spent close to 10 years in Canberra and during this time I undertook my undergraduate degree as a mature student. Just as I completed this degree and was ready to embark upon a career, I found myself in the centre of a massive public service hiring freeze like we have just announced here in Tassie. The Abbott government had decided it needed to cull 12,000 public service jobs and bring down government staffing costs. This had an enormous impact on a city where such a significant number of staff are employed by the government. For most of these staff, they are not the safe frontline jobs, these are the back office staff. Frontline jobs in the federal sphere are distributed around the country. Canberra houses the support staff, HR departments, admin functions and ministerial support. The opposition has stated, 'Make no mistake, a blanket freeze will create inefficiencies and impact on government service delivery. Tasmanians are set to pay a heavy price'. These are strong words, and they are worth consideration. After all, how do you determine a necessary staff member?

I can tell you that those years in Canberra were difficult. It was challenging for people to feel the tide of non-recruitment, to see their friends move to other workplaces, head off to their hometowns as the temporary contracts were not renewed and they struggled to manage the family budgets on single incomes. Good people do eventually find new roles, but it takes time. The public service slowly declined through natural attrition. It was a slow process, but as the system ran its course, we did see a sensible reduction in middle management positions.

A job freeze can bring swings and roundabouts, turning permanent staff into temps or outsourcing to contractors, or it can bring lasting effective change when managed well. This could be what Tasmania needs right now.

Over the past few years, it has been incredibly difficult for the non-government industries and not-for-profits to compete with government wages and recruit middle management positions. This is partly why our non-profit organisations are struggling and pushing so hard for increases in indexation. Tasmania's public service needs to become more agile and efficient, and often that only comes from a decided poke.

The 18 per cent increase of staff over the past five years has not shown a significant improvement in delivery timeframes or quality services in many cases. However, I am far from convinced that the government's newly announced efficiency and productivity unit (EPU) is the answer. It says to me that the government does not have faith in department secretaries and deputy secretaries to lead change. It also begs the question as to why the Audit Office is not being utilised.

The government is claiming the EPU is a recommendation from Saul Eslake's report. That is quite misleading. Mr Eslake recommended a review and evaluation unit to be based in Treasury and Finance, a much less political suggestion. The 2021 Watt Review of the State Service recommended a small review and evaluation unit to report annually. What the government has announced today is a very different proposition.

I strongly believe in making our state more efficient and reducing waste of all types, but it will take a willingness by those in positions of power to listen to innovative and bold ideas. Reforming the local government sector is a concept the Liberals have flirted with since coming to government, but there is so much more potential to do. The Premier called local government councils their partners yesterday, an improvement on the attacks they received last year. The future of local government reform has given some clear directions about how we can create efficiencies and improve services to Tasmanians, but the current budget lacks the funding to support these programs, despite promises to do just that. There are some councils serious about amalgamations in Braddon and they are keen to see the government put the money on the table. It was pleasing to see the recent leadership for the Minister of Local Government in his response to the investigation of Dorset Council. I hope we can continue to see support for our local government partners.

The Macquarie Point Stadium continues to divide opinion. The AFL's ultimatum that there will be no team without a roofed, Hobart-centred, taxpayer-funded stadium leaves a bad taste for even some diehard footy fans, not just in Tasmania but also around Australia. For many, it is trying to run before you can walk. Why not demonstrate a clear need for a new infrastructure first and take the public with us? Why not take the time to make this build right, not rush it and look back with regret? After all, I do wonder, if we are going to spend that much money on one building, are we sure that seating 23,000 is enough? Why not assess demand before we make such a massive decision on behalf of taxpayers?

The member for Bass and I have been asked a question numerous times over the summer break, both from the media and members of the public generally. We have been asked: if we are so critical of the government's response to the budget and the stadium, why do we continue to offer the Premier confidence and supply? It is a legitimate question and one I would like to take this opportunity to address. The agreement we signed and then reconfirmed when we became independent is something we take very seriously. Yes, it is with the Premier, but it is also with the people of Tasmania. Stability and predictability are vital for the parliament to function well, but also to provide confidence in our community. Our last opinion poll confirmed that neither of the major parties are attracting overwhelming support for the community, which says to me that the prospect of another election this soon after the last one will be very unpopular.

I also do not believe it will be right for the member of Bass and I to entertain the possibility of withdrawing our support based on a policy difference of opinion. Two first time independents should not be holding the government to ransom. Instead, we will continue to argue as strongly as we can for better policy outcomes and on behalf of our communities. Our commitment to certainty will not be changing unless there is a very clear example of corruption or malfeasance.

While I will continue to engage in the statewide issues that affect us all, there are issues directly related to my part of the state that I will be focusing on this year. I am determined to be a champion for some of the causes and organisations that do not necessarily grab the headlines. For example, I am enormously proud to support the Emu Valley Rhododendron Garden in its pursuit of a more secure future. The garden is an independent, non-profit community organisation developing and maintaining a multi-award-winning private garden aimed at showcasing and conserving the Rhododendron genus. 

In their botanical paradise, they grow over half the known approximately 1000 species of Rhododendrons in the world. It is a lot of flowers. In November last year, $200,000 was announced to support the garden's future for the next year or so. When my office was recently in touch with the gardens board, that money was yet to be delivered. I really hope that has been rectified. I am determined to help the garden in the medium and long term and will continue to explore potential ongoing funding streams and partnerships. 

Another unsung gem on the north-west coast is Camp Clayton near Ulverstone. Many in this Chamber may have visited the campgrounds when they were a little younger and had a little bit more energy to burn. The camp has played a positive role in so many lives and has been largely self-sufficient for a very long time. However, the cost of insurance is skyrocketing and it will soon have an impact on its ability to deliver a wonderful experience to Tasmanians. There is a federal government election bin with both major parties. I believe there are creative ways we can be supported at a state level as well.

These are two examples of many I intend to highlight across the year. It is an honour to represent the people of Braddon. I hope to see many as possible as I volunteer at SteamFest on Sunday.

[5.42 p.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - It is my pleasure to rise and make a contribution to the state of the state speech. I have been a member of the state parliament for nearly nine years both in this House and the other House. I have witnessed a number of state of the state speeches. I have to say yesterday's speech by the Premier was easily one of the worst that I have heard in my time. The Premier had no shame claiming he had all the answers to the problems that he has created. It was like he was on a totally different planet. Planet debt, massive debt, record deficits and business conditions and confidence that makes it very hard to do business in Tasmania. 

The worst aspect of his speech was his privatisation agenda. Notably, it was an agenda he did not take to the Tasmanian people because he knows it stinks. He knows Tasmanians do not like privatisation. It is now history repeating. In the 1990s we had a minority Liberal government drowning in debt trying to sell the Hydro. At least they had the courage of their convictions to take that proposal to the Tasmanian people. Now we have Premier Rockliff drowning in debt, trying to sell everything else.

While they fall apart on that side of the House, we are united on this side. The Labor party has been renewed with a strong focus on jobs and the economy. We support Dean Winter's leadership. We are hungry for government because we know Tasmanians deserve better. The choice at the next election will be very clear: a minority Liberal government that has proven they cannot be trusted with the state's finances or on major infrastructure like the Spirits, which is the biggest infrastructure stuff-up in Tasmania's history, or the Labor party with a proven track record of paying off Liberal debt and building the big projects that drive our state forward.

When a government loses their way, there are telltale signs. They lose the people who get them there. They have lost some of their best players on that side: Hodgman, Gutwein, Courtney, tick. They run out of motivation and sensible ideas, tick. Then time and excuses catch up with them, tick. Premier Rockliff showed yesterday that when these things happen and you know your government has passed its use by date, you just recycle your ideas and the excuses and forget that it was your time in government that caused it.

Red tape reduction is always a good thing to do. It appears the government thought it was doing it for 11 years. I found this on their website: the Tasmanian government is committed to cutting red tape and making Tasmania one of the best places in Australia to do business. Red tape is usually defined as excessive or unnecessary complexity, regulations, processes and bureaucracy that results in delays or inaction. It includes a situation where a business or a member of the community needs government permission to do something - usually in the form of a permit or approval - and that permission is unreasonably heavy-handed, slow or outdated.

A significant proportion of regulation exists to address legitimate community expectations in relation to protecting people, places, products and property. However, regulation becomes a form of red tape when it fails to adequately or disproportionately address these community expectations and should therefore be reformed or removed.

However, Premier Rockliff acted yesterday like he just found out about red tape and the handbrake that it is putting on our economy. He has had a Red Tape Reduction Coordinator in his time in government. The Red Tape Reduction Coordinator consults extensively with Tasmanian businesses and industry to address red tape issues. Over the past decade, the Tasmanian government has addressed nearly 200 red tape issues, with over 86 per cent resolved so far.

They are claiming a huge win on their website, but suddenly it is news to the Premier that this is a handbrake on our economy. If you have a red tape issue, you can submit it on their website, and I am sure that they have had plenty of submissions, probably a whole lot of them that have never been acted upon.

The feedback I hear in the business community is that Stuart Clues, who is the Red Tape Reduction Coordinator, writes very good reports and people respect him, but they do not think he has the necessary authority to do anything about the issues he is identifying.

I look forward to seeing what this government comes up with and what it brings to this House and whether we actually have dedicated sitting days and whether things actually get done because we have had 11 years of inaction and the Premier suddenly trying to reinvent his government when this problem has been clear the whole time.

We want to see less red tape on this side of the House, which was what our night time economy strategy was all about. Our leader Dean Winter has been out talking about the Liquor Licensing Act, which is 35 years old. He has been criticised from time to time by the government for the proposals in this policy, which is exactly about slashing red tape making Tasmania an interesting place for people to live: an act that is well overdue for an overhaul to make it simpler. 

Some of the things that we propose are: introducing a simplified low-cost liquor licence for small business pop-up events and food trucks; establishing live music and cultural precincts to protect venues from noise complaints; streamlining permits from festivals and events with a one-stop-shop approach for approvals; guaranteeing liquor licence approval time frames to provide certainty for businesses and event organisers; expanding affordable late night transport options in collaboration with public and private providers; encouraging family friendly and non-alcoholic options such as twilight markets, outdoor cinemas and expanded non-alcoholic drink offerings; and supporting partnerships between arts organisations and licensed venues with co-funding for events that combine liquor service with live performance, gallery exhibitions or community arts.

I can see a whole sitting dealing with some of the issues right there. If the Premier wants to bring something to this parliament, that is a good place to start. 

Back to my previous point about the governments having use-by dates. Nothing screams that the government has lost its way and should be thrown out of office more than when it cannot manage the budget or the economy. In recent times it is indisputable that Premier Rockliff's minority government is bad for jobs, bad for the economy and bad for the budget.

Just in the last few months alone, Moody's has downgraded Tasmania's credit outlook from stable to negative. This follows S&P from November last year, which also downgraded its outlook for Tasmania from stable to negative. It cited things like weakening governance, poor budget discipline and an unambitious fiscal strategy that really is not worth the paper it is written on - because at that stage they had no intention of sticking to any of it.

Recent ABS figures show 8700 full-time jobs have been lost since Premier Rockliff took his government into minority. The CommSec State of the States report highlighted that Tasmania is the only state with negative employment growth and is now bottom of the leaderboard for annual growth rates on the eight economic indicators.

We also saw more job losses forecast in the Revised Estimates Report just released. The Revised Estimates Report shows a weakening labour market with some 3000 fewer jobs than forecast in the Budget. We have had recent NAB monthly surveys that have showed Tasmania has some of the worst business confidence of any state.

Deloitte's Business Outlook forecasts Tasmania to have the weakest economic growth in the nation through to 2030 and confirms that Tasmania is facing a jobs crisis. Data on Tasmania's economy has been consistent across the board: our economy is flatlining and jobs are vanishing at a rapid rate under Premier Rockliff.

On the budget, Saul Eslake said recently upon the release of the Revised Estimates Report:

With every state and territory now having presented its mid-year budget review (Tasmania is always the last - every other jurisdiction provides its mid-year review in December), Tasmania's state public sector finances are now in most respects the worst in the nation.

In particular, Tasmania is projecting total non-financial public sector cash deficits averaging 5.4 per cent of gross state product, GSP, over the four years to 2027-28, compared with Queensland, which dramatically revised up its deficit and debt forecasts at the end of January, five per cent of GSP and the other two were recognised basket cases - the Northern Territory 2.5 per cent, Victoria two per cent. Tasmania's non-financial public sector net debt is now projected to rise to 32.7 per cent of GSP by 2027-28, compared to 29.9 per cent for Vic, 29.4 per cent for the Northern Territory, 26.6 per cent for South Australia and 26.1 per cent for Queensland, and if you include Tasmania's superannuation liability, which we should because it is a financial obligation - 

This government has done nothing about that in the last 11 years. You are often criticising this side of the House on that regard. You had a policy at the election to put to bank GST windfalls. That has disappeared into thin air.

then Tasmania's net financial liabilities are forecast to reach 55.8 per cent of GSP by the end of the 2027-28 financial year and far above the Northern Territory with 41.4 per cent for Victoria at 37.6 per cent and Queensland and South Australia both at 33.9 per cent.

The statements made by Premier Rockliff yesterday were in an alternative universe and these statements by Saul Eslake, an independent, respected economist, directly contradict the Premier's commentary. I know who I believe. The Liberals have nobody to blame but themselves. No-one else to blame for decisions like spending $7.2 million on a northern prison that was never built. I heard the corrections minister before saying it was a 'redirection'. Others would call it a massive backflip after years of putting the community through a whole lot of trauma: $7.2 million to not build a prison.

For the millions gifted to public servants suspended as a result of the most heinous allegations and there is still a cloud over that, hundreds of thousands of dollars gifted to their own ministers who chose to start their own legal action against all precedents and guidelines, $22 million on gantries around greater Hobart that do not even work and appear to have old technology. How easy is it to buy a phone cradle and put on Google Maps in your car, and that will still tell you you are stuck in a traffic jam in an arterial road and there is no other option and that you are going to be late to your meeting, but we could just have these black signs around greater Hobart. Everywhere I go in the community, people were talking about them and what a joke they are and they blame this government for it.

Just last year, $39 million was spent on advertising and self promotion, including tens of thousands of ads claiming that they were fast tracking the wharf for the new Spirits. We had Premier Rockliff claiming that 80 per cent of the piles have been driven. I have done a site tour there. I know for a fact that the gantry in the river - those piles - are going to take a long time. He can claim that the piles are all on track but there are still going to be major delays.

There was $65 million in consultants just last year - $40 million more than budgeted; $46 million on travel, including the Coordinator-General's five-star hotels. All up, more than a billion dollars blown on consultants' advertising travel over the past 10 years; and more than $100 million on planning for Marinus, which is years behind schedule; $180 million for a completely avoidable energy crisis. That was when I was first elected. The minister for Energy was Matthew Groom at the time.

There was $11 million on three hydrogen buses which cannot operate because there is no hydrogen. I think they are sitting in a shed somewhere. There was $50 million for a hydrogen action plan and they said we would be making hydrogen by now. There is still no power or water to that site and it does not look like it is happening any time soon. There was $3 million in local government reform which they later backflipped on; and the Spirits project, of course, which is $500 million over budget and six years late now.

We can go on and on about wasteful Liberal spending. Over the course of this year I probably will because Tasmanians cannot afford this reckless spending.

Premier Rockliff's minority government has shown that they cannot manage the state's finances. What have we got to show for it? Some of the worst health and education outcomes in the country. We have too many Tasmanians who cannot put a roof over their head and participate in the economy. What did they start with? They started in 2014 with no net debt at all. $200 million of cash and investments in the bank. Our state's finances were in a healthy spot, the healthiest in the nation. We had a AAA credit rating.

However, after 11 years of Liberals, we have now out of control deficits, projected net debt of $10 billion, which is actually worse than that because there have been dodgy accountants the whole time in here. There are things like a billion dollars' worth of health expenditure that is not accounted for in the revised Estimates report, and the Treasurer claims it is all manageable. What he is not telling you is the debt is totally out of control and that he has this mythical pathway to surplus. The only evidence of a surplus is if you turn the charts upside down. He needs a cash surplus to stabilise the debt. We do not even know when that is going to happen. He cannot answer it. It cannot continue.

Tasmania needs a change. Tasmania needs a government that is going to be responsible for the state's finances. That includes ruling out new taxes, which we did last year after Saul Eslake's report. Instead, we have proposed wholesale reform of Tasmania's government businesses to focus on them and their economic interests, to sharpen up their management and to ensure that we have got proper oversight. A plan that we put forward, the Liberals criticised that, and then they adopted it as their own. We will get Tasmania's government businesses working for Tasmanians and we will not sell them off in some sort of fire sale, because they are important for the budget sustainability. They deliver dividends that help pay for schools and hospitals.

Last year we announced 10 policies to get started on the difficult work of budget repair. We said we would axe consultants, bring them in house like the federal government has done very successfully to save money, terminating outsource contracts that do not deliver value for money. Ban pork-barrelling - they took massive issue with this because they have made an art form of it - to stop Tasmanian taxpayers being ripped off. Tasking Treasury with identifying and ending failed programs - this is something the Treasurer has adopted as his own. This is more in line with Saul Eslake's recommendations. They are claiming that theirs is, but this is more in line with Saul's recommendations and the Premier is talking about it too.

We also said we would improve budget transparency by including ten year projections for debt and deficit in every budget as Saul Eslake's report recommended. We did not just ignore his report, unlike those over on that side. Establishing an independent parliamentary budget office will be a fantastic thing for Tasmania.

I recently had the good fortune of going to the mainland with the member for Clark over there. We had a good look at parliamentary budget offices in other jurisdictions. They are doing a good job. They are well respected by all sides of politics doing policy costings and maintaining budget and economic models. They are doing research and advice. It has demonstrably improved accountability and the economic debate in those jurisdictions.

We will also drive efficiencies by sharing more specialised services across agencies to reduce duplication, introduce performance-based budgeting that links government spending to measurable outcomes. They are spending over that side, but the outcomes are not going in the same direction. Merge generic IT infrastructure to reduce maintenance costs, strengthening buying power and improving cyber security.

We are committed to allocating every cent that we save through these initiatives to paying down the Liberal debt. We have been upfront that these budget repair policies are only the first steps, the things that we will do on day one to start repairing the mess in which they have left the state. I know that the debt is too big, and that their deficits are too out of control for it to be fixed overnight. It has taken a long time of Liberal governments to get us in this mess. It is going to take quite some time to get us out of there. We have to treat their record debt like a family treats their mortgage: something to be paid down carefully, methodically, and steadily over time with discipline.

As our leader stated, over the course of next year, we will unveil the most comprehensive policy package any opposition has put forward in decades, which will include fiscal discipline measures.

I am going to leave that part because I am running out of time. I did want to touch on some privatisation issues, which is a mistake. It is a failed experiment in every jurisdiction that has tried this. It is a fire sale because they have broken the budget and they are desperate. Tasmania should not mistake that. Tasmanians have built up these assets over time through hard work and we know in particular in the energy sector it has been a massive failure. In Victoria, 170 per cent increases in prices since they privatised parts of the sector. Productivity has also declined and it just leads to perverse outcomes. 

We know privatisation leads to an erosion of public services. When essential services such as transport, car insurance and energy are handed over to private corporations, the primary objective often shifts from public welfare to profit maximisation. There is a huge focus on the bottom line. We know it will increase inequality. I said some of this stuff today in the MPI. We know that there are negative consequences in terms of accountability. Our GBEs, yes, there have been some faults in the last 12 months, but we have accountability in this place. We have democratic reforms taking place because of that. You lose all of that with a private corporation. 

We had the Health minister yesterday lamenting about a board that is not very well connected to Tasmania making commercial decisions that were impacting private health services here, maternity services that are very much needed here in Hobart and loved by the community, disappearing. This is the sort of thing that will happen when you privatise businesses. Of course, it is bad for workers; bad for their working conditions. You often see jobs being slashed and burned and we will fight this agenda of the Premier. He did not take it to an election and we will certainly be holding him to account in this place to make sure Tasmanians are not ripped off.

Time expired.

[6.02 p.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, this is my first state of the state speech that I have been here for and my first time replying. I am underwhelmed. Certainly, is not strong enough for what we have seen. It is 2025. We have just five years left to do all that is in our power to mitigate the worst of climate change. That is five years to reduce our carbon emissions to 43 per cent below 2005 levels as required under the Paris Agreement by 2030. Only five years left in UN's decade on ecosystem restoration. We had 10 years. It is 10 years to protect and restore nature and what flagship projects have we nominated? Absolutely none. 

It is 2025 and after 11 years of the Liberals in government, we are not where we need to be to protect Tasmania's people and our wild places to secure a comfortable survival for future generations on a warming planet. Our magnificent island is literally burning as we speak. Ancient Gondwana relic Huon pines that were here in Lutruwita before colonisation, before the birth and trial of Socrates have been put at risk. Climate induced extreme weather events will increase exponentially in frequency and severity. On the present budget trajectory, future Tasmanians are already inheriting enormous intergenerational debt. Not taking climate action will increase the costs for generations to come, and the state of the planet will only become harder to restore and to reverse the damage that has been done.

To burden future generations of Tasmanians with that inheritance is a political choice. It is appalling that in his state of the state speech, the Premier did not mention the state of our island's natural environment. This place that we all call home is under threat. Yet the Premier was silent. Where is the plan for emission reduction at the scale required? Where is the protection for our remaining sways of carbon sequestering forests for the peat soils in under protected areas like the Spero-Wanderer Wilderness in the south-west. Where is the plan for renewable energy zones that are both appropriately scaled projects and in locations that can coexist with biodiversity, which, to be clear, is also in crisis? Yesterday was an opportunity for a visionary plan for economic and environmental transformation to a restorative and regenerative future for Tasmania to secure a comfortable inhabitable island for generations to come and that opportunity was missed.

Also missing from the Premier's speech was justice for the Tasmanian Aboriginal community. After11 years of the Liberal in government, where are the land returns, the truth telling, the treaty and the justice for the Palawa people? What we have seen delivered is a huge blow of uncertainty: undefined essential and non-essential workers wondering what their future will be amid the cost-of-living crisis. We have Tasmanians in the state service deeply invested in various programs wondering whether the Tasmanian Government's knock off replica of DOGE, the EPU will close down their hard work. In police and fire and emergency services, the e-mail that was sent this morning subject recruitment freeze update said, 'While the government policy has been identified by the government, working through the detail to ensure that we have a process around its implementation will take some time'. How much time do emergency services workers and all State Service workers have to be left in this liberal limbo?

SES crews on the Tasman Peninsula have recently highlighted the impact that hindrance on reliable digital connectivity has had on their emergency responses. Indeed, it was just a fortnight ago that over 100 people on the peninsula showed up to a public meeting to discuss how the excess loads on their digital services, particularly over tourism season, means that they are disconnected. It is 2025 and digital services are an essential service. We have to sufficiently invest in it to begin with.

Bridging the digital divide in Tasmania must be a priority. I note in the Treasurer's media release from 5 March, he said about the EPU: 'We must ensure that every dollar spent is value for taxpayer money and we are not wasting resources on things that are not a priority'. How can building a billion dollar stadium, which is not essential, trump basic connectivity for our state to remain relevant in the modern world? Explain that prioritisation, that choice, to the business owners on the Tasman Peninsula, in St Helens, in Swansea, who lose critical connectivity, who lose money when the EFTPOS machines go down each summer when the transient tourism population goes in and they simply do not have the digital connectivity to deal with the extra people.

What will cuts and privatisation mean for primary industries, biosecurity and the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania (NRE Tas)? For example, taking action on invasive species. The Commonwealth Government's round seven of the Australian Heritage Grant results are just online. NRE Tas has been granted $400,000 for 2024-25 and that money will go towards the management of invasive species in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (TWWHA). It will be for monitoring of deer presence, identification of feral cat distribution, and weed control - perhaps for foxglove - in areas of high conservation value and visitor use. Unlike the round of funding that came in 2021-22, it is not for the eradication of deer in the TWWHA or the Walls of Jerusalem National Park. That is a lost opportunity, considering that first program saw over 1000 deer removed from the TWWHA, which is a significant figure given that the original figures thought that the population in that area was between 100 and 300, nowhere near 1000.

Now, there is $400,000 to share between deer monitoring and those other programs. Perhaps there will be another program to come to deal with the deer and all the other invasive species, but that seems highly unlikely with the cuts coming.

The management of cats: in the Liberals response to the 2024 State of the Environment report, they stated that their action on invasive species was having the 2024-29 cat management plan underway. 2024 is now behind us, we are a year into that plan and yet if you have a quick check on the NRE Tas website, it reveals that no such plan exists. Where is it?

What will the state of our parks be if there are cuts to or privatisation of any part of NRE Tas? Parks are already under resourced, with a ton of critical work to be done. We still have not seen the REA reforms which were first proposed in 2021. Nothing. No draft legislation, not even the proposed options paper has come forward. The review of the Maria Island Management Plan. Why has the draft plan been sitting on the minister's desk for more than six months? We have been talking about the review that commenced almost 4 years ago. 

What have the Liberals been doing as our parks decline? They have been attempting to privatise them as they continue on the political trail of Trump and Musk. Further privatisation and disregard of protections will come if we continue down the same way as the US now. 

The EOI process is a great example of a failed non-essential program, and it must go. In fact, the Office of Coordinator-General's EOI website has not been updated since September 2024, almost six months ago. Is that an indication that no projects are progressing, or just a further lack of transparency about this secretive process? The privatisation agenda has completely failed and that EOI process has resulted in just nine projects in 10 years. 

Why on earth are we destroying the very intrinsic values of wilderness that people travel here from around the world to see to allegedly make a profit off tourism if the exclusive operators leasing our public land are not even paying the bills? The lease on public World Heritage listed land, Lake Malbena and Halls Island was renewed to Wild Drake, who is in a court ordered liquidation process and last year found to be over $10,000 in arrears for unpaid invoices to Parks. When the Halls Island lease comes up on 31 March 2025, there is an enormous chance to finally pull the pin on this saga which has put our parks management on the global stage for all the wrong reasons. 

I have already spoken on today's MPIs about the need to reinvest the non-essential budget from the illogical $40 million-plus Tyndall Range Walk and the fanciful now $200 million-plus Cradle Cableway. This funding should go directly to NRE Tas. It should be used to develop the world class Walking Track Management Framework first proposed in 2011 to provide more remote firefighting capabilities and tools, to undertake greater on-ground truthing for cultural sites and vegetation mapping and monitoring. This data is essential for firefighting. It was a recommendation back in 2006 from a senate inquiry reviewing the bushfires that summer. Again, almost a decade on, it is recommendation 8 in the State of the Environment Report.

It is essential that we look at the lessons to be learned from the fires this summer and, indeed, the fires in our TWWHA and ancient landscapes back in 2016, 2018 and 2019 too. This government must go back and review the recommendations that were made from the various federal inquiries following those fires and ensure that all of those recommendations have been implemented. 

One huge failure has been letting the TWWHA drop off the World Heritage Committee State of Conservation reporting cycle. It was the top of the list recommendation of the 2016 senate inquiry report, to ensure that the TWWHA remains on the annual reporting cycle, and yet it was removed a few years ago. Tasmania must immediately rectify this situation with the Australian Government.

We need to get serious about future-proofing our parks, as is our obligation under the World Heritage Convention under section II article 4:

Each State Party to this Convention recognizes that the duty of ensuring the identification, protection, conservation, presentation and transmission to future generations of the cultural and natural heritage … It will do all it can to this end, to the utmost of its own resources and, where appropriate, with any international assistance and co-operation.

We do not have to privatise our parks for a strong nature-based tourism industry. Regenerative tourism has been cited as a future industry. The numbers of tourism investment from low and no-impact niche market segments is being capitalised on elsewhere around Australia. Tasmania needs to get on board or we will be completely left behind.

Data from Tourism Research Australia was showing that during the 2023 to 2024 financial year, international visitors spent $2.6 billion on travel that involves birdwatching. Let us get on with perpetual protection of the Orford Bird Sanctuary, for example, on the east coast or, up at the Derwent River, let us Ramsar List and promote the wonderful Murphys Flat Wetlands.

As light pollution steals the shine of our stars right around the world, in Tasmania we could safeguard one of the highest quality dark skies, south-west sky country, but we have not. We could have had that dark sky sanctuary. While we have not acted on it, New Zealand now has five dark sky sanctuaries. Unlike the state government, the under-resourced local governments and passionate hardworking Tasmanian communities have realised the opportunity of dark sky tourism and the urgency to protect sky country. They have been willing to do the work and they will reap the rewards and share the state's wonder with the world. The Tasman Council is undergoing light monitoring to become a dark sky community, the Wellington Trust has an application for Wellington Park to be a dark sky park, and the Ross District community is working up to become a dark sky community.

Just last week, The Examiner ran the story headline, 'State's family violence rate a secret shame'. An analysis from the Tasmanian Family and Sexual Violence Alliance of data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows that Tasmania had the highest rate of intimate partner violence, cohabiting partner violence, stalking and emotional abuse from a cohabiting partner in the country. In the 2024-25 Tasmanian Budget, they contributed $14.8 million in specific funding for family and sexual violence. That works out to be about $25.96 per Tasmanian, the least per capita of any state or territory in the country.

We, the Greens, stand with the extraordinary organisations in the sector, calling for investigation into an alternative funding model, such as a needs-based model, which was highly successful for the Northern Territory, who share similar family, domestic and sexual violence rates to Tasmania. Laurel House and Engender Equality recently highlighted the need for the state government to develop a 10-year family and sexual violence workforce strategy. Presently, the state looks heavily to mainland states and overseas to fill these specialty positions.

The latest announcement from July 2025 of the $15.7 million investment with the federal government into Tasmania's various programs is welcome, but it is a drop of water in the ocean of what is truly needed. It will not go far enough to meet the needs of all victim/survivors or to fill all the worker positions that are currently required to get the best of the best in this space, to come here and work in Tasmania. How does this much needed recruitment upscale sit in the government cuts? What will be of the government's long-touted review of the Family Violence Act?

Where is the 30-month statutory review into the implementation of TasTAFE (Skills and Training Business) Act 2021? What will be the future of TAFE? It is not a GBE, but it is a not-for-profit government business. What cuts and uncertainties will TAFE face in a time when we need many new facilities and training opportunities? For example, an automotive Centre of Excellence is urgently needed. Mechanics and workshop owners need accessible upskilling opportunities to meet the rapid growth of EV use, and to ensure that all internal combustion vehicles still on our roads are maintained to the appropriate emission standard. Given that flooding has forced the closure of the aged Campbell Street training facility, now is the perfect time to progress a state-of-the-art automotive Centre of Excellence.

Tasmania can dodge the DOGE if we assess the integrity and the necessity of all projects currently on the table and only take forward those that will provide the fundamentals to future generations of Tasmania. To fully fund programs that will ensure a safe, kind, healed and empathetic community in our future, we must immediately turn our heads to tackling the climate crisis. This is not just a political greed issue. This is a planetary survival issue. There is no greater threat to Tasmania's future, so we must get on with it. We must absolutely invest all that we can. It is essential that we do that now while we still have time to mitigate the worst.

[6.18 p.m.]
Mr BEHRAKIS - Honourable Speaker, I am proud to be part of the team with an ambitious reform agenda that is willing to make the hard and necessary decisions to ensure Tasmanian has a government and a public service that delivers bang for buck and works for them. I am proud to continue working towards delivering for Tasmanians across our amazing island state. 

Since being re-elected, this government has delivered more than 1000 initiatives in the first 300 days of its 2030 Strong Plan, and we are just warming up. As the Premier and the Treasurer have said, we have a plan to achieve a sensible pathway to surplus without raising taxes. Of course, we are planning to take a comprehensive look at the government's programs. 

This is a government that has delivered more than 4000 social and affordable homes to provide for more Tasmanians, with plans to do even more with our ambitious yet very achievable target of 10,000 social and affordable homes by 2032.

This is a government that realises the importance of our economy, by reducing the red tape that does not necessarily hold business back, but makes it that much more difficult than it ought to be to achieve great outcomes. That is why we are proud to see a Tasmania with an unemployment rate of just four per cent, half of what it was under the former government. 

We are proud to have an economy that has grown to record levels, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics reporting, just today, that our state funnel demand has grown to a record $48.9 billion. Our focus on a strong economy brings so many benefits: businesses, with the confidence to employ more Tasmanians, businesses with the confidence to invest and build future infrastructure for the future needs and market conditions of our people, and businesses with the want to train and upskill its workers to be the best workforce possible.

These benefits are only a few when you consider that a strong economy with strong business supports all the things we would like and need as Tasmanians. It allows us to support better education outcomes. Like now, how we have 100 per cent of government schools using structured funding programs from prep to year 2. It allows us to invest in better health outcomes, like 2300 new healthcare workers recruited in the last 10 months. This is the work we are doing for future generations while working for all Tasmanians.

Tasmanians, who, just like me, believe that we live in the best state to live, work and raise a family, ambitious Tasmanians who look to establish businesses here in our local communities. In Tasmania, about 97 per cent of our businesses are small businesses. These entrepreneurs are the engine room of our economy. Brands Tasmania research shows young Australians already think Tasmania is the most entrepreneurial state. We need to make our state an even better place to do business and reduce the red tape, the green tape, the yellow tape and any other colour tape you can think of.

The reason Business Council of Australia released a study with a report supporting what I already felt - that we live in one of the best places in Australia to do business, but the report did highlight, as we heard from the Premier, that we are dead last in the country for a number of licences required to do business. It sounds obvious and we hear about it and we need to improve this.

That is what Tasmanians want. They want a government that is mature enough to set aside pride and to acknowledge when things need improving, to acknowledge when there is more work to be done. What they do not want is the immature rhetoric that we have already heard from the so-called alternative government, trying to score points when real issues are being discussed in this place. We need to open up more opportunity for those aspiring Tasmanians who want to open up businesses without the added pressures of excessive paperwork and the rigmarole which can easily be simplified.

The report found it takes 37 licences to work at a cafe and 26 licences to open a retail shop. 37 licences for a business like a cafe to open up and sell a cup of coffee. Administering these licences also takes a considerable amount of time, effort and energy, along with the bureaucratic people power to make these systems work. They disadvantage small businesses who, unlike large companies, do not have full time legal and compliance divisions. We would rather see our small business owners focusing on growing their businesses, employing Tasmanians and delivering the great products and services that they are well known for.

I am proud to be part of a government that has a focus to make doing business easier in Tasmania by cutting back those licences, working with businesses to strip away unnecessary regulation, to encourage growth in the small business sector and more importantly, ensuring people operate safely and within the law.

Establishing a red tape portal where Tasmanians can log their experiences of unnecessary red tape because they know better than anybody what those unnecessary red tape is. The Opposition Leader said in his reply speech that Labor is suddenly now pro-business and pro-development. I look forward to seeing them put their money where their mouth is and support these important reforms that will make doing business and building in our state that much easier. Time will tell.

When you think red tape, you do not need to look too much further than housing and planning to see it can take as long physically to build a house as it actually takes to do the paperwork and the compliance to get approval to build it. I definitely saw that in my time on the Hobart City Council. For everyday Tasmanians, this makes no sense. We are working to streamline that process, making it easier for hard working Tasmanians to be able to navigate our housing and planning sector with the dream of owning their own home. Making it easier by taking action to get homes built cheaper, faster and easier. We know all too well that red tape gets in the way of building homes faster. It delays construction and costs Tasmanians time and money.

What would appear to be simple changes like busting the red tape action that would allow a plumber to install beams to satisfy plumbing work in a standard house construction without needing to go through a council for approval. This simple but important change will mean that homes can be completed and ready to move in weeks earlier, saving families and our industry time and money.

It is about making the building process easier and simpler for Tasmanian families along with our building and construction sector while still adhering to the National Construction Code. Much can be said of the planning scheme and the action our government is taking to make Tasmania's planning scheme simpler, faster and fairer.

However, we have not stopped there and nor do we intend to. We are focusing on land that will unlock thousands of new homes for home builders and developers within the Tasmanian space. We are proposing the extension of the urban growth boundary across greater Hobart. That is 615 hectares of land across Hobart, with the potential of almost 10,000 new homes and as a government we want to unlock more opportunities for homes to be built.
We are sending a message to home builders and developers far and wide to come and build those homes that we need in Tasmania. We are introducing legislation that allows only those agreed or affected by planning decision to lodge an appeal to TASCAT to stop the construction of much needed housing and infrastructure falling victim to those usual anti-everything activists and the same anti-everything activists that we saw disgracefully climbing on our parliament House just yesterday.

We want those wanting to do business or building the housing and infrastructure our states need to hear yes, more often than they hear no. These proposed changes will result in more jobs for Tasmanian tradies, helping to keep our economy growing and strong.

We have already heard sensationalist language today and plenty of fear mongering. The reality is we are working to ensure our public service is working for Tasmanians and we want to make sure it is the right size for the state to ensure it is lean and effective rather than bloated and to ensure that the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars are being wasted through inefficiency, duplication or superfluous spending. We are taking a magnifying glass, not a hatchet, to our public service and making sure it is operating as efficiently as possible and appropriately spending taxpayers' hard-earned dollars.

Likewise, we understand that while some things like Hydro which Labor plan to gut until they change their mind just 24 hours later, the best kept in government ownership, often the private sector just does it better. That is why we are investigating which GBEs would better serve Tasmanians in the private sector. We will be assessing the benefits of moving several entities out of government ownership with respected economist, Saul Eslake, to provide advice to the government.

Tasmania is one of the best places in the world to live, work and do business and we are committed to continuously asking ourselves how we can do better - what regulations, what initiatives or programs that may have been good or necessary at the time but are now out of date and would be better off pruned. What inefficiencies in our public service have grown over time that can be excised to make sure the public service is best using taxpayers' hard earned money?

We have heard that this is why we have the Red Tape Reduction Coordinator and why has his work not been done already? Just late last year, the government tabled a report on our red tape reduction which showed that we have responded to and removed 86 per cent of the 198 red tape issues which were identified through that process, but this is not a job done if it was not done before and it has failed to have been done. When you trim or prune the plants in your garden and then you have to come back months later to prune them again, it was not a failure of your gardening the previous time, it is work that continuously needs to happen. There are regulations, there are all sorts of red tape or whatever that is relevant and needed, perhaps, at the time and years later is now either out of date or conflicting with other regulations or is no longer relevant and needs to be pruned. It is an ongoing work that needs to continuously be done and that is why, as the Premier said, this is not a one-step fix. It is something that is going to involve an ongoing piece of work to make sure that our laws are working for Tasmanians and not the other way around.

We then move on to the other question that is next to be asked - what is the alternative? Is there an alternative? We have heard a lot of whingeing and catastrophising from the other side, but not much in the way of plans. The truth is that Labor just does not have one. They were not able to provide an alternative budget even when they were directed to last year by the Tasmanian government. If they are unable to provide an alternative, what is it that they would do differently? They put out media releases every day criticising the government for not spending enough money and then they come into this place and talk about spending.

The opposition leader said, and Mr Willie said earlier, that if they were in government that would pay down the debt; but how? Last year in the last election, Labor's $4 billion-worth of election promises were stated to be funded with $2 billion in cuts to services and infrastructure. What was being proposed to be cut? We saw the display of financial incompetence when Dr Broad had to correct and revise their election costings document not once, not twice, but 11 times. It is one time for every year they have been in opposition.

We know that Labor's number one policy is whingeing, being negative at the front of parliament lawns on camera and getting that headline, and they talk a lot. They sat here today talking of trust but the people of Tasmania have made it very clear that so long as Labor does not have a plan, the people of Tasmania do not trust them. The only thing that they will back on quicker than their principles are their own costings.

Their record is raising taxes, cutting jobs and mismanaging the finances. Tasmanians deserve strong, stable, responsible financial management, and that is our commitment; for a strong plan, steady hands and responsible management to keep Tasmania moving forward. We will continue to deliver for our current Tasmanians and for future generations and that future is bright.

[6.30 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I am always quite pleased to follow my colleague, the member for Clark, Mr Behrakis. 

Before I start my contribution, I will reflect on some of the questions he asked. What would Labor do if we were in government? If we had been in government for the last 11 years, we would not have racked up $10 billion in debt, which is what we have seen after 11 years of Liberal Party mismanagement of the budget. We are now in the worst financial circumstances the state has ever seen. The result of that is the incredible announcement the Premier made yesterday that he has a fire sale of public assets. That is what we are looking at. Why is the government looking at a fire sale of public assets? They are looking at having to do that. Sell off government businesses that are there to provide services in the public good because of their budget mismanagement over 11 years now.

That is why they are looking at doing that. I expected that my state of the state address today would be focusing on some of the things that I have seen in my portfolios, particularly the portfolio of health, looking at the vacancy control board that the former minister put in place, looking at the $600 million worth of budget cuts, wondering how their recently announced recruitment freeze is going to affect the Health department.

I do have to stop before I get to those things and comment on the Premier's announcement yesterday: a fire sale of public assets. He ruled out the Hydro but, as we saw in Question Time today, everything else is up for grabs. Everything else is at risk. He named up MAIB, Metro, and TasNetworks. Those are first for the chop. Motor Accidents Insurance Board, registrations and other costs are going to go up for vehicle users.

Metro, our bus service, provides bus transport all around the state. Providing transport is an essential service of government. It is not a luxury; it is not an added extra. It is something that government is obliged to provide for their citizens. If you sell off Metro, who knows how much Tasmanian consumers will be paying for their transport in the future? Who knows what the working conditions of bus drivers and those who service them, mechanics and other tradespeople who look after that fleet, will be like when Metro gets sold off to the highest bidder? It is government's job to provide public services. They are there to provide services for the public good. Selling them off to the highest bidder will mean we will see commercial decisions made by a private board motivated by the needs of their shareholders. That is what we will see. There is a role for private business but not in the delivery of essential public services. That is what we are going to see when Metro gets sold off to the highest bidder.

When TasNetworks goes on a 99-year lease, what is that going to do to power prices across Tasmania? Providing power, energy resources is government's job. It is a public good. It is a public asset. It is government's job to provide services to their citizens. It is not exclusive to Tasmania. That is every government's job in any democratic society. That is what is at risk here.

When the Premier says words like, 'They are just going to see which companies', 'which businesses owned by government are necessary', 'which ones they can keep and which ones they can get rid of' - these entities are there to provide services that would be otherwise provided by government. It will not come as a surprise to members to know that I believe there are alternatives. 

Those services could be provided and managed within the public sector, but over various governments they have been outsourced to government owned businesses that provide funding to government as a result of their operations. Those things are going to be at risk. 

The Premier said so much today in Question Time accusing Labor of running a scare campaign for talking about the fact that the Premier is going to sell off public assets, Metro, MAIB, TasNetworks, the Land Titles Office, which is part of government. He said Labor is going to run a scare campaign about them selling off public assets. It is not a scare campaign to just be highlighting what the government is doing. He has already announced he is going to be selling off those public assets, Deputy Speaker.

If we talk about it, as the opposition, that is not a scare campaign, that is simply speaking the truth. It is talking about what the government has got planned, what they have announced. They have announced they are going to sell those off. Of course we will be talking about it and of course we will be fighting it tooth and nail, because that is going to affect jobs. It is going to affect peoples' jobs, it is going to affect Tasmanians and how much they pay for transport, how much they pay for power.

You have to ask, what is next? He said everything is on the chopping block except for Hydro, but what else might they be looking to privatise? We have already heard there are parts of the Public Trustee that are going to be privatised. That was announced at budget time last year. Are they going to privatise the Port Arthur historic site? Are they going to privatise Aurora? What about Tasmanian Irrigation? What about Tasracing? What about other entities? 

We have already seen a halfway step to the privatisation of public and social housing in this state when the government invented Homes Tasmania, a statutory authority. It is not a GBE, but it was one step of removing public and social housing from the responsibility of government by setting up a new statutory authority to manage it. Who is to say that is not going to be next? Who is to say that is not going to be something that the government will sell off?

A public responsibility. A government responsibility to provide public and social housing is in the public interest. It is a public good and these things need to stay in public hands because when they are not, we see decisions made by private boards as we saw with Healthscope's decision to remove maternity services from the Hobart Private hospital recently. That is a commercial decision that that hospital made based on the needs of their business and their shareholders. We can disagree with it all we like, but they are a private for-profit business. We all understand that. By turning public companies into private companies, that is what we are going to see. We are going to see private interests dictating the decisions that are made around services that should be provided by the government for the public good.

Most public servants in Tasmania found out about this plan in the media. They found out about the plan to sell off GBEs and they found out about the plan for the recruitment freeze in the media. They did not hear about it from their line managers, they did not hear about it from their departmental secretaries, and they did not hear about it from their ministers. They heard about it in the media. I can tell you, public servants I know, who I have great respect for at all levels, are feeling very fearful this week. They are feeling very fearful about what it means for their jobs and the jobs of their colleagues. It is not acceptable that the government could make such a great big decision by putting on hold any recruitment process that is happening across the state sector without talking to their own workforce. 

Here is what the Community and Public Sector Union, who represents many of the workers in those GBEs and in the public sector had to say yesterday. The announcement that public services and government business enterprises will be privatised is further evidence the Rockliff government cares more for private profiteering than the Tasmanian community. 

Evidence from interstate and overseas shows that privatisation ends up costing the taxpayer more and leads to poorer services, higher prices and reduced safety. The proposed privatisation of Metro is particularly worrying given one of the most recent examples of public transport privatisation in Australia proved an abject failure. The South Australian government is now bringing trains back into public hands after the previous Liberal government's deal with Keolis Downer was costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars per year more. In Victoria, the privatisation of public trains led to worse on-time performance and significantly increased fares, despite government assurances that it would not increase prices. Over the last five to 10 years, numerous prisons around the country have returned to public ownership after disastrous privatisations punctuated by dangerous levels of understaffing.

We have seen this show before. We have seen this movie before. We have seen other state governments privatise these assets. It goes disastrously badly for both governments and citizens and then they have to bring them back into public hands. They have to unscramble that egg and it is a mess. That is what we are going to see here. Privatising public assets like transport, power and who knows what else? Housing. Who knows what else is on the chopping block? It is going to be a huge mess left for someone to clean up later. 

Mark my words, there will be generations of Tasmanians who will suffer as a result of this decision and will pay for this decision. It will affect in particular, those workforces in GBEs. When energy assets in Victoria were privatised back in the 1990s, not only did power prices increase, but four out of every five jobs were lost, when they went from public jobs to private jobs. We are going to see jobs lost as a result of this decision of the Premier and the government. We are going to see jobs lost and we are going to see people suffer as a result of this. Many of the Liberal Party speakers this week have talked about the importance of employment and the importance of the dignity of work. I agree with that, but we are going to see mass job losses across those GBEs and across the state service as a result of these decisions.

As for the public sector job freeze, we have heard a lot of words around essential versus non-essential workers. The Deputy Premier put out a press release earlier today talking about the fact that they are going to be appointing a committee to start looking at some of these decisions. We have not had any definitions given by the Premier of what an essential worker is and what a non-essential worker is. All I could think about was my memory of those vacancy control board decisions that were being made in the Health Department last year. We were told that the Vacancy Control Board - to remind members what that was, that was about a recruitment freeze, basically, on jobs across the THS and the health department.

We were told no frontline jobs would go, but sure enough, there were nurses' jobs that were slashed out of the eating disorders clinic at the Royal Hobart Hospital. One of the outpatient clinics that was getting incredible results, a 50 per cent reduction in hospital admissions as a result of that outpatient clinic's work, had nurse positions lost. If a nurse is not a frontline worker, well, put me in the corner and call me an old fuddy duddy. Nurses are, by anyone's definition, frontline workers.

Infectious disease cleaners were cut from the Royal Hobart Hospital. These are cleaners who have a high level of training, a high level of personal protective equipment. They do a more dangerous job because they are exposed to infectious diseases in their day-to-day work. Two of those cleaners were cut, leaving only three in the team. Now that has had operational effects in making it a slower process to get people into beds. They cut cleaners at the hospital. Infectious disease cleaners were cut at the hospital. If a cleaner is not a frontline worker, well, then again, put me in the corner. I would be surprised if anyone did not agree that a cleaner and a nurse are not frontline workers in the health system.

When they told us no frontline workers would be affected by vacancy control, they were. When they tell us now essential versus non-essential workers, you have to understand that public sector workers at every level are scared for their jobs right now. They are scared for their jobs today because there is no definition. The Premier has not told us one word about what he considers essential and non-essential. Every single worker in the Tasmanian public sector is right to be worried now. You can say that that is fearmongering. You can say that that is whipping up a fear in public servants, or you can recognise that that is something the government has done through this decision. We are highlighting that as the opposition, which is our job, to represent our membership, to represent our communities. That is what we are doing. 

We heard the member for Clark today saying that the whole Police and Fire and Emergency department got an email saying all current recruitment processes are to be paused. I have heard from people working in the Department of Education and Young People that they have also been told recruitment processes will be paused across the board. If there is a blanket pause on recruitment, that is not specific to essential and non-essential. That is a blanket pause on recruitment. It will be affecting people's work and it will be affecting Tasmanians receiving services.
The other thing that was announced yesterday is that the government is going to do a review of all government programs. The Deputy Premier at his press release said government must consider every taxpayer dollar it spends and make sure that they are getting value for money. I do not disagree with that. Governments should be careful about where they spend their money, but again that is going to make a whole lot of people very fearful.

There is a range of government programs that actually operate to support our communities. Are they going to be reviewing things like Active Tasmania that gives grants to increase participation in sport? Are they going to be looking at cutting Migration Tasmania that manages our skilled and business migration programs? What about Jobs Tasmania, supporting people into work, including young people, migrants, people returning to work after a period out of the workforce? Are they going to be looking at Ticket to Play? That is a government program that helps young people who would not otherwise be able to afford the fees and the gear to play sport to actually access those activities and participate as their peers can. Are they going to cut the free wi-fi program that is the statewide access to free wi-fi across libraries and other public institutions? Are they going to privatise libraries? Are they going to privatise Service Tasmania? Who knows.

All they have done is make these grand announcements about the fact that they are going to cut down on spending. They are going to cut down on debt that they have created. Let us not forget why we are here. We got to this point because of 11 years of mismanagement of the budget by the Liberal Party. That is why we are in this black hole. That is why we are in this difficult situation that they said other states are facing as well.

Other states have had this experience, they have privatised assets and they have had to bring them back into public hands. It is a failed experiment that has been proved wrong elsewhere. It will be proved wrong here. We will keep fighting against it.

Before I finish, I also want to mention the thing I probably found the weirdest in the Premier's speech yesterday. He said there is too much legislation: 79 million words of government legislation and we do not need that many words. It would take months to read them all. I am sorry, but I was flabbergasted by that statement by the Premier. I do not think that a government's efficiency can be tested against how many words of legislation there are.

I remember back when I was a staff member working on the Legal Profession Act, which was about mutual recognition across states for lawyers to be registered, and also looking at some standardised processes and so on in the legal sector. There were jokes at the time that it was physically the biggest act that the Tasmanian parliament had dealt with. You could use it as a doorstop. It is pretty dry content, you could probably use it as a doorstop, but none of those words were unnecessary. They were necessary to actually do the legislating that was required of that job.

The Premier said we will have sitting days set aside - parliamentary sitting days set aside - especially for removing legislation. I want to know what is for the chop there. I guess we will find out in those dedicated sitting days. What are they looking at cutting? The Premier said that if ministers are going to bring in a law or regulation, they are going to have to get rid of one first. What does that mean? Last year we did some pretty important regulations around the sale of vapes and dealing with tobacco sales in Tasmania. Does that mean the Health minister is going to have to get rid of another important regulation if she brings in other regulations in the health system?
Does it mean that the Attorney-General, when he brings in a Justice (Miscellaneous) Bill that deals with a whole lot of different things that need to be fixed, that he is going to have to not do something else, it is in his legislative agenda, or get rid of a law that already exists? What is up for grabs? Are they going to roll back the Anti-Discrimination Act? Are they going to roll back the birth certificate ID laws that we achieved in 2019 that are world-leading?

I have the administrative arrangements here. There are a lot of pieces of legislation, but I want to know what is for the chop. The Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, perhaps? That is dealing with mediation as an alternative to litigation. If they get rid of that, they are going to see court waitlists go up again.

Are they going to get rid of the Animal Welfare Act? That is for preventing the neglect and cruelty of animals. Are they going to get rid of the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act? They might as well, because we have not seen any responsible budgeting by this government. Are they going to get rid of the Biosecurity Act that is looking at Tasmanian biosecurity status in industry and public wellbeing? Are they going to get rid of the Child and Youth Safe Organisations Act? We just did that last year. Are they going to get rid of the Coroners Act, the Crown Lands Act, the Electricity Industry Safety Act? You get my point.

Yes, there are a lot of laws on Tasmanian statute books, as there should be. That is the job of the legislature - to legislate. To say that we have got 79 million words of legislation and we have to cut some is really one of the weirdest things I have heard, not just in the seven years I have been serving as an MP in this place, but in the years that I worked on legislation and policy. It is a very strange measure to say we have too many laws and we have to get rid of some.

I do not disagree with it as a concept. I try to tell my kids that. If you are going to buy a new jumper, maybe think about getting rid of one that you do not wear anymore. You do not need that many physical possessions. Words on paper do not take up physical room - with the exception of that doorstop act I talked about before. It is really quite farcical to think that we would be getting rid of legislation simply because we think it is a bit long and it would take months to read it all.

We really are in a very sad situation now in Tasmania. We have 11 years. Tasmanians keep electing this government and they keep disappointing us. For good or bad, you are in government, you have got control of the Treasury benches and you need to do a lot better.

[6.50 p.m.]
Mr FERGUSON (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I rise today to speak and commend the Premier on his annual address. In my contribution tonight, I will be discussing the very important initiatives that our Premier is leading for and on behalf of the government, and I hope for and on behalf of the parliament. I will also be addressing the economy and opportunities for us as a government to support our business community, to keep our economy growing and strong and looking after people in employment. I will also be addressing the Spirits debacle, and I will be addressing pokies' reform.

The first thing I want to say is that I commend the Premier on his speech. It was an outstanding address. The comment was made as well by a number of people that it is the first state of the state address, or Premier's Address, in many years that has not cost the taxpayer in money. Indeed, it is about strengthening the budget position. I enjoyed the speech. It was a strong speech. It had a sense of wanting to make sensible strategic changes that are in the state's economic and financial interests.

In my response today I want to make some comments that really do support the thrust of that address and to encourage those who have been so negative throughout this debate already to just reflect on what positive role they could be playing in helping to secure our state's stronger future.

First of all, the Premier discussed the audit of government programs and State Service resources to make sure that we are not wasting resources on things that are not a current priority. There might have been a priority earlier, but perhaps in the context of competing priorities today that they would not be seen as the highest priority or getting good value enabling the government to be structured more efficiently. Also, assessing the benefits of moving entities out of government ownership with respected economist, Saul Eslake, to provide advice the government. I want to speak on those two points.

First of all, I want to say that the real issue that does confront us, all of us, whether you are Liberal, Labor, Green, Independent, or other, is that we have an obligation to do the right thing by current and future generations of young Tasmanians. It is our responsibility to leave things to that generation better than we find them. Taking on debt is responsible and logical during a pandemic to build better long-term productive infrastructure, to provide overdue justice to victims of sexual abuse by previous generations. That is right and proper, and we have done that. However, as well, I think we recognise that budget repair is needed.

The government's new fiscal strategy, some two years old now, charts that course with clear target parameters. The best way to do this is not the type of budget cuts that I witnessed in 2011, rather, instead, strategic efficiency tools which have least impact on services, coupled with ceasing new spending decisions unless there is an equal or greater savings measure in ineffective government programs to go with it.

A warning to Labor: do not bother playing obvious retail political games with privatisation. The only significant privatisation that has occurred in this place in recent years was the Labor government's sale of the Tote.

Deputy Speaker, look how well Labor handled the sale of energy retailer, Aurora, something that was, in fact, supported by the Liberals because, let us remember, it is a retailer of electricity which is subject to price regulation, retail regulation. Labor could not even effect that sale, despite putting it on the market under Bryan Green, such was the butchered process that they tried.

Regarding divestment options, I want to speak in support of the process that has been outlined by the Premier and by the Treasurer. It is an assessment. It is not, as our opponents would have you believe, a fire sale. That is just a cheap jargon slogan for the debate.

As people here would know, in my previous role as a former Treasurer, I was generally sceptical of asset sales, but I myself made the point in the media and in the budget roadshow following the last budget, we did need to take a look at them, particularly thinking of those entities that have a diminishing capital value: those entities that perhaps do not provide significant returns to budget or where an ownership change might yield better public outcomes. I am on the team for this assessment process and encourage others to be as well, to be open-minded about that.

In my own view, there are a number of entities which make perfect sense for the government to consider divestment options. There is a proper process to be followed to ensure that it is a carefully considered decision making tree and that value is captured for our community, for our taxpayers, for our state. The described process is sound and the lead reviewer, Mr Eslake, I have to say I deeply respect and I think it has been an inspired decision by the Premier to put Mr Eslake deep into that process. I am pleased that he has agreed to do so. I want to emphasise in my time right now that decisions have not been made at this point in time. The Premier made that point this morning in questions and, in fact, this House itself will be one of the key decision-makers for any that are taken forward. 

The economy is so important because, as has been discussed, it is the lifeline for the other important initiatives that government wants to do. Now, our economy in Tasmania, we have grown by so much. Unemployment is at record lows, but the economic headwinds that I warned about as treasurer two years ago in 2022-23 budget have now been with us, they are now affecting families and businesses. In fact, those headwinds have been even stronger with the Reserve Bank increasing interest rates faster and more frequently than even itself had suggested it may need to start to do.

Government overstimulus of our economy and underlying inflation has had the effect of hurting Tasmanian families. ABS Lending Finance and RBA lending rates data reveal that Tasmanian families have, on average, paid additional home mortgage interest of $31,000 in the three years since 2022 when those 12 interest rate rises began: $31,000 on average size mortgage in Tasmania, affecting our community.

Note we have only had one recent reduction of one quarter of 1 per cent to the official cash rate and the RBA has actually warned us to not expect too many rate cuts anytime soon.  I am pleased that the government's number one focus is on the economy. I was very attracted to the Premier's way of explaining it when he said:

I will focus on one thing and one thing only: a strong economy, not because everything else that this government is doing is not important - it is - but because a strong economy is vital to support all those things. 

That is why we do need to support the government's agenda to cut back on red tape. Do not mock it, do it. In fact, this House has been doing it. I was disappointed to see a public servant's name brought into the House, but since Mr Clues was named, I want to praise Mr Clues and the great work that he has done. A first class public servant actually, he has assisted the government in cutting red tape and here, in this House, I can recall being involved in at least two tranches of red tape reduction and reform in the building industry. 

We want to see more of that so that that audit that showed, I think it was something like 200 measures, can grow by even more. Supporting these initiatives is going to genuinely assist a small business, not just to get started, not just to survive, but even to thrive, and I am all for it. I am sensing around the Chamber there is an appetite for cutting red tape, so let us get on and do that and support it. 

Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to address pokies reform. The work that I undertook as treasurer and in my role as minister for Finance delivered the entirety of the future gaming markets policy that our party took to the 2018 election together, with commitments made in this House during the debate, to make Tasmania a safer place for people to gamble their own money if they want to - and we are talking here about a mandatory pre-commitment scheme, the gold standard in pokie harm reduction.

It has been recommended by the nation's Productivity Commission years ago, by the way, recommended by our own Tasmanian Liquor and Gaming Commission, already implemented - this is not a well-known fact - in Federal Group's Launceston and Hobart casinos for their premium players program, and currently in the process of being implemented across all venues, casinos, pubs and clubs in Victoria. Good on them. 

I take this opportunity today to make the vow that, for whatever time I serve as a member of this House, as Liberal member for Bass, I will remain totally committed to the policy contained within the ministerial direction of September 2022 and our pre-election commitment to maintain that policy with additional harm-reduction measures while we work through the timeframe.

The Treasurer has informed me that the 2022 ministerial direction remains current and in force and that is a very good thing. I am pleased to be able to say, and the Premier has assured me, that the government remains committed to the policy, but there is a matter of timing, getting it implemented, utilising national understanding, including in the work occurring in Victoria in a smooth and effective manner, and I accept that.

My position is to work for and, when necessary, fight for what is good for the people of our state, the public interest.

I am continually appalled but not surprised at the behaviour of some in the gambling lobby who have done extremely well out of the reforms that this House delivered and were successfully implemented on 1 July 2023. They are fiercely protecting their extraordinary additional profits and lobbying to hold back reform. Who will disagree with me?

The central point is this - these overdue reforms will put real power back into the hands of players deciding in advance how much money they wanted to be able to lose before they start losing. This is a power shift from the software that is legally programmed to influence the player to think that they are winning when they are actually losing, and it will not in any way stop people choosing how to spend their own money. Again, who could argue with that?

Of course, I take the opportunity to say that I stand by the statements contained in my letters that were amongst a range of documents released recently. They speak for themselves.

Mr Deputy Speaker, as members are aware, with a heavy heart, I resigned from my commissions as a minister last October after 10 years of continuous service to Tasmanians. Some of the billions of dollars' worth of infrastructure delivery that I had successfully overseen in my time included the new Royal Hobart Hospital, the LGH Women and Children's Building, the Midland Highway, the Burnie Shiploader, and the Bridgewater bridge, possibly, my favourite, to name just a few. 

It must be said I agree with those who say the TT-line Spirits' issue at Devonport was, and is, a significant failure for all of us who are proud to call Tasmania home.

As at that date in October, despite all of the information that I had honestly provided to this House and to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) committee, Labor wanted to play politics and they did. In fairness to all concerned, and Labor, until that date no person and no organisation had accepted any culpability for the mess within their business, so in accordance with Westminster tradition, I took responsibility and honourably resigned. 

However, I do want to bring to the attention of the House, since the House rose last November, that TT-Line did finally acknowledge its faults. It was stated by one that it was an exercise in the bleeding obvious, but it was a welcome development. This was stated by the new company chair, Mr Damian Bugg KC, at the GBE parliamentary hearings on 5 December. By this time, both the former chair and the former chief executive of TT-Line had departed the company, and Mr Bugg had the opportunity to review matters and relevant documentation to his own satisfaction.

From my point of view, this was a breakthrough acceptance of blame that should have been offered much sooner, but I am pleased it was at least now acknowledged and on the public record in a committee of this House. While a number of Independents were in the political mix in the lead up to my resignation in October, I want to acknowledge the member for Franklin, Mr O'Byrne. He spoke up in one area that was important to me and that was that in his view, I had not misled parliament, and I was grateful for that. With everything else that had happened, somebody like Mr O'Byrne at least felt willing to put that on the record.

The challenges with the TT-Line project are deeply regrettable and have been a major learning experience for all involved, including me, Mr Deputy Speaker, 

Responsibility for the decisions made has been shared across various individuals and entities. In the months before and then after the election, the government took significant steps to proactively and then reactively address the issues. To the colleagues in this House, I say we genuinely believed this would ensure the project would be delivered but those interventions were not enough, and we now know we were not told the full story. 

The government and I have apologised for this, but this is an investment which we still believe will ultimately be a very positive and exciting development for Tasmania. Even as one of the most experienced ministers here, I have learned a big lesson the hard way. That lesson is that my trust in others can unfortunately fail to pick up on problems. Ministers have to be sceptical about advice that we receive in a way that is proportionate to the risk to the public interest. Check it with others. Insist on evidence. Do not let board members overstay their terms except in exceptional circumstances, and that happens. Be prepared to offend your chairs or CEOs in holding them to account, and deal swiftly with them when they are not up to the job or engage in the blame game. They are the lessons I have learned and I wanted to share that with this House.

I restate my sense of Westminster responsibility and repeat that apology again today. I have learned a lot out of what happened. I have had the benefit of time to think about these things and speak with people who care for me and have my interest at heart, and of course my family and friends. I believe that with the personal disappointment that accompanied it, I actually have a lot to be grateful for, having served in this government as Deputy Premier, as Treasurer and a minister for important portfolios for more than a decade combined. My achievements and, more importantly, my relationships through all that time, I will treasure for the rest of my life. 

However, my particular praise is for Julie and our family. They have been like a rock. They have been like a rock in a storm and throughout the many disruptions and stressful times they have been through with me over that decade in ministry and more than two decades in politics, shouts volumes about the quality of their characters and the godly, sacrificial love they give, keeping our family together and supporting me in the work that I do for our community. 

There are some subjects very close to my heart. In closing, I want to take the opportunity to really thank those members, particularly of my team on this side of the Chamber. You might be surprised to know how many people on the other side of the Chamber have expressed in different ways their kindness and thoughts for me. I love being in this team. I am grateful to be a member of the Tasmanian Liberal Party, the Tasmanian Liberal government. We have done a lot in these nearly 11 years. We have really turned Tasmania around and developed a different culture that we can make things happen here. That it is an exciting place to live. You do not have to leave to be able to pursue your opportunities and we can in fact dream and then deliver on ambitious projects such as people said would never be possible. We are making a difference in the lives of Tasmanians. 

Just 11 years ago I think you would have dared to believe that the unemployment rate in Tasmania could be amongst the lowest in the country. Not a couple of per cent higher, but among the lowest in the country and consistently so that it would be recognised by leading economists. As a leading economy and one of the most exciting places to do business where the net business surveys would indicate it is the best state in the country in terms of business conditions. That is what we have achieved. We have achieved together as a state and for the people of our state, our families, our businesses and of course our most precious Tasmanians, our children. I will continue to serve. I commend the Premier on his address. Let us get behind those important initiatives because that is how we can build a stronger economy. If we have a stronger economy, all of the other important priorities become far more achievable.

[7.11 p.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I rise this evening to make my contribution to the state of state address. In doing so, I stand here proudly at the beginning of the parliamentary year: a year, I think, which will demonstrate to Tasmanians the extraordinary position this state finds itself in and equally will demonstrate to Tasmanians the strong position that Tasmanian Labor are in.

This morning, we heard from our leader, Dean Winter, in his address-in-reply. It was coloured with strength and energy. It was visionary. It set out a very clear determination about where Tasmanian Labor are at. From across the Chamber, the immature chuckles that occur are an indication of where this government is at. Yesterday, the Premier, in stark contrast, was flat, uninspired in content in terms of where he sees the state of Tasmania now, and unable to articulate a clear, strong, hopeful vision for this state. Instead, proudly off the back of yesterday, he declared that, you know what, we are going into our fourth 100-day plan. 

When you are the leader of a state in a country like Australia, your responsibility is to cast a vision, to show hope, and to say what the future 20 or 50 years ahead could be for this state. Instead, they are so far down in the weeds and tripping over themselves that not only have they done a first 100-day plan or a second 100-day plan or a third 100-day plan, but they are now so focused on their feet that they are delivering a fourth 100-day plan.

Compared to Tasmanian Labor, where we are together, we are strong. We are determined and focused on industry, on business, on development, on workers, each and every day here. Leading here on this side from the centre, we are looking after and looking forward for all Tasmanians. There is no better demonstration of where we are at on this side of the Chamber.

I acknowledge Rebecca White. In leaving the parliament over the break, I wish her very well for her campaign ahead. I acknowledge the presence in the chamber today of Casey Farrell, our newest member of the Tasmania Labor Party. He is a member who is clear about what can happen in Tasmania, particularly when you invest in innovation and look to the future. He is a strong individual with a great position and a fantastic addition to our team.

Having mentioned Rebecca White and Casey Farrell, I would also like to, as others in the Chamber have done, shout out my Bass colleague, Jess Teesdale, who is a candidate in the federal election coming up for Bass. She is an exceptional candidate with a clear understanding and commitment to the future of Tasmania, having been an educator, now ensuring that she can be determined to make changes for Tasmania and the country, for young people and their future in particular.

I speak about our side of the Chamber and where we are at with confidence and with pride. I do want to reflect, as the state of the state addresses are about reflecting on the state of this state, on where this government seems to be right now. It is really important to reinforce that. Yes, this is the second day back to the parliament of the year - a very late start for a parliament. Clearly this is a strategy by this government to delay scrutiny and delay being in this place where they can be held to account for the failings that they continue to deliver. At this point, where we are reflecting on the state of Tasmania, we have to be reminded that the opening of parliament is not the beginning. This is the 11th year of this government, and they are responsible for all of the things being experienced and not experienced in Tasmania right now. 

This government, after 11 years, have built up the red tape; have been responsible for the public service; have stopped investment coming into this place; have made it harder for people to start small and micro businesses; harder for people to expand their existing businesses, and harder for the interests of people across the world to invest their funds into Tasmania. That is all at the feet of this government. They, over the last 11 years, have created the circumstances that we find ourselves in now. Those circumstances from a budgetary position are woeful. 

This government has successfully destroyed the Tasmanian budget. Over 11 years of budget mismanagement, we find ourselves in the worst circumstances in terms of budget debt and budget deficit. We know that this government all of a sudden are trying to come across as refreshed and interested in how they might actually walk that back. We know that this government is great with announcements, great with thought bubbles, great with quick ideas, but horrendous with delivery and follow-up. You hear the Treasurer say it all the time, on repeat, 'We have a pathway to surplus'. Well, Treasurer, outline what that looks like. Draw a picture for Tasmanians about what your pathway to surplus looks like.
Every six months there is a financial report provided to the people of Tasmania, whether it be the budget that is delivered or the half point report. Why do you not map out what you see the pathway to surplus to be every six months? What does it look like in six months' time? What does it look like in 12 months' time, 18 months' time? What are the actual figures that you are determining you are delivering us back to surplus? No-one on this side, or the people in Tasmania believe that you actually have that.

You have to know by now, just by saying something, it does not make it true. Just by saying that you are going to create - and I loved this one today, the Premier said it and other ministers have said it, and I have written it down here - 'We are going to create an environment, an economy for investment' - 'We are going to create'. Yes, after 11 years you have completely stuffed up the ecosystem in Tasmania, where people do not want to invest or cannot invest. You have made it so hard; your own admissions today that there is too much red tape. There is too much of you getting in the way of opportunities for Tasmania.

The poor budgetary position could actually be improved if we could attract in and secure investment. In my own portfolio area of energy renewables, there is around $25 billion. That is $25 billion waiting in the wings ready to be invested in Tasmania. If we could add that economic stimulus to our communities, many of them regional communities, then Tasmania would not actually be so reliant on trying to correct your poor budget position.

We know that with the most well-known projects. Robbins Island has eight years of planning challenges so far under their belt. Whaleback Ridge took four years to get approved into a planning process. Whaleback Ridge still do not have a staged lease that could be conditioned to allow them to secure future support for their project. Robbins Island are still faced with challenges.

You look at the uncertainty around the North West Transmission Developments. Are you actually capable of delivering that infrastructure? Is that something you are actually committed to? There is a whole lot of scepticism in the community around your capacity and your commitment to delivering that transmission infrastructure.

Are you actually committed to Marinus? Marinus was actually - and to his credit, although all he does is make great announcements - the former minister bought this package of opportunity to the country. Tasmania actually birthed out the Marinus idea. Now, Tasmania remains to get in the way. Tasmanian Labor said if you cannot do it, get out of the way. As a way to ensure and protect the Tasmanian financial position, you sell off your share to the federal government to ensure that, one, we do not have to invest those funds, we could be investing them into Tasmania to make things in Tasmania, and two, do not be the reason why Marinus is actually delayed further and further, which makes it more expensive.

At the moment, you are a handbrake on opportunity. You are a handbrake on investment. It is impacting Tasmanians right across the state, but most exceptionally in regional Tasmania.

There are onshore wind opportunities. There are offshore wind opportunities in Tasmania. There has been a recognition that we have a generational and economic step-change opportunity to attract economic activity to Bell Bay, not only through the Bass Strait offshore wind zone, but from the other offshore wind zones across South Australia, Victoria, and up to New South Wales.

If we are not fast enough - I say 'we' because I love Tasmania and I feel like we are part of pushing outcomes for Tasmania. If you are not fast enough, if you do not get out of the way of opportunity, then we are going to lose it.

You committed money into the budget for the Bell Bay zone to take the opportunity of offshore wind, but you delayed it and stretched it out over the forward Estimates. That money, the $5 million, needs to be brought forward to this year to create the business case to ensure that we can secure the investment to get that benefit into Tasmania. You will not consider that. If we cannot get the business case done and secure those investments in the next six to 12 months, the opportunity will be lost. You have to reverse-engineer the timing to make sure that we are ready and available for when that opportunity comes.

For people who have not quite grasped the scale of that opportunity, if we can actually benefit from and utilise Bell Bay to deliver all those opportunities offshore in Bass Strait, it is the equivalent of the 100 years of hydro development in Tasmania in terms of a new economic opportunity for this state. It would be incredible, but it requires this government to get out of their way and act with urgency, as everyone is saying, to deliver and secure those opportunities.

There are so many things within Tasmania that are being let down or made too difficult by this government, whether it be in energy, whether it be in agriculture, whether it be in science and tech - missed opportunities to invest in and secure extra cable access into Tasmania.

We know that Tasmanian Labor when we are in government and we are supporting our community, we build things, we deliver things, we make things happen. That is the core of Tasmania. That is the history of Tasmanian Labor. That is what we are pushing this government to do or telling this government to get out of the way so we in Tasmania do not continue to erode our financial position, our budgetary position and the Tasmanian economic position - because Tasmanians cannot afford it. Tasmanians cannot afford this privatisation agenda where you seek to sell off income-producing assets of Tasmania, then to pay off your debt without having the future opportunity to continue to invest the funds coming out of those entities into services in Tasmania. There are some pretty basic principles that need to be considered straight up about where the privatisation works and is in Tassie's best interest or not. There is also a whole lot of history that demonstrates that privatisation pushes up costs, reduces and erodes the assets, and that is not in Tasmania's interest.

In some really simple conversations with people recently, they are expressing concerns like, 'I do not know why they do not take certain things off the table when there are some pretty basic fundamentals, like, if a balance sheet of an entity cannot actually deliver the services without financial support from the government, then there isn't going to be interest to do that because it does not make commercial sense'. That is the type of entity that is actually delivering an essential service for this state and that is the role of government.

When you have the list of all the different GBEs and state-owned companies in Tasmania that are not off the list that are not in the firing line, and the Premier says that Hydro is free from that and he calls it, I believe, a 'sacred cow', I know he actually means that it is a 'cash cow'. We know that for 11 years this government has been using Hydro as a cash cow, not as an opportunity to facilitate economic activity and growth and provide for more in Tasmania but for drawing out the funds from Hydro instead of seeing it strategically, and that is where Tasmania is being failed.

Tasmanian Labor - we are committed. We have demonstrated through our leader's presentation today that we are looking after the workers of Tasmania. We are looking after business and industry. We are pro-development. We want to get Tasmania moving. We want to get Tasmania building things again. Two of the big projects in Tasmania that are bringing in or have the potential to bring in international investment, the HIF project and Abel, again have been frustrated by time by not being able to get the things that they need to progress. HIF still magically had the transmission project taken out from under them. Have you made a commitment? Will you make a commitment to make sure that they have transmission to connect to? With Abel in Bell Bay there were a number of proponents looking to do a range of things in the Hydrogen Hub at Bell Bay and pretty much Abel Energy is the only project still standing, yet there is this excruciating process to try to determine who will be the lead proponent for the Bell Bay Hydrogen Hub. While this government continues to repeat processes and delay processes, they are missing out on opportunities. We could be leading the world in so many things in Tasmania, but this government keeps tripping over, keeps getting in the way, keeps being possum in the headlights, stuck in action because they do not know how to deliver anymore.

One of the things in terms of delivering for Tasmania, in its simplest form, is water and power is needed at Bell Bay. We know that if the generators cannot get approvals, then we cannot get more power. There is not enough power being generated in Tasmania to run existing businesses or the growth in existing businesses and there is definitely not enough for the attraction of new investment. However, there are solutions. We spent hours in this parliament a year and a bit ago making sure that we changed the legislation to allow water to go through the Tamar Irrigation Scheme into Bell Bay. We created the instruments to do it. Everyone is motivated for it. 

The Tamar farmers want the water, the people in Bell Bay want the water. Why? You, as a government, just miss out on the simple wins all the time. I do not know why you make the processes for yourself so frustrating and why you make your life so difficult when there are some really obvious things to get going. If action was taken to ensure that water could get to Bell Bay, that you drag the water through the irrigators in the Tamar Valley on the way through, you get solutions and productivity and growth and you get jobs, you get all sorts of opportunities and you have had years to deliver that and still no outcomes. 

The frustration is growing. The frustration is real. I know that this government says that certain people stand up with them and say that, this is a fantastic - there are entities in this state who know that they need to support the government. When people are in government, people want to support them no matter how badly you are doing, but what I love today was - I thought it was very fascinating - that even the Small Business Council of Tasmania questions the capacity of this government to deliver genuine, positive outcomes for Tasmania through the privatisation agenda. 

There are so many people now who are questioning this government, who are disappointed with this government, who are being let down by this government. What Tasmania needs is competence, strength, action - do stuff, get out of your own way, make sure that you support the people in the community who are building the jobs, who are actually doing the work. The pipeline of work opportunity in Tasmania is pretty bumpy. There are people in Tasmania who have invested so much for so long. They want to activate things across the state in different regions. They again are being let down by how smooth the pipeline of work works through this government.
Tasmanian Labor: we build stuff, we get things moving, we support our communities, we support workers. I have to say, and they are almost all in the Chamber tonight, in terms of supporting workers, the salmon industry in Tasmania has been under fire, and irresponsibly so, by many - not only in the recent weeks, but for months and for years. You would not find better people in Tasmania - more salt of the earth, committed to local community people than the people who work in our salmon farms across Tasmania. What has been happening in the last couple of weeks has been horrendous for everybody, but none more than the people who work on those farms. We have seen immediate responses by the salmon industry to the devastation of the mortalities where they have had teams walking beaches, collecting material, working 24/7 with harvesting to ensure that they can get through the peak of, and actually as I understand it, we are now through the peak of this devastating time. 

There were people who spoke today about the devastation, about the events that have occurred with no compassion, no care for the people who are actually doing this work. There are people working 24/7, on their days off, in their hours off, going because they are passionate and care about the environments that they work in. People who work in the salmon industry in Tasmania are also fishers, surfers, divers and footy coaches. They are family members who love what they do and care deeply about what they do. I know there have been some people on the other side who have also said this either today or yesterday, but I have a shout-out for the people in the salmon industry who, under such intense pressure and such unfair characterisation, continue to get up every day exhausted and overwhelmed by what is happening, but they do it because they know it is the right thing to do and because they care. 

Tasmanian Labor will always back our salmon workers. We will always back our forestry workers. We will always back mining workers. We will always back renewable energy projects. We build stuff, we get things done, we make sure we are not in the way. We are committed to the future of Tasmania. We are committed to the future of young people in Tasmania.

We want to see this place work together to ensure there are strong futures for Tasmania. We want to see that this government stops the economic and the budgetary wrecking that is occurring right now, takes seriously its responsibilities, is committed to the things that it announces, not just trying to shine -


ADJOURNMENT

[7.30 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House do now adjourn.


Answer to Question - Spirit of Tasmania Vessels - Cost of Fit-out usingFly-in Fly-out Workers

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - If I may, I will provide some answers. 

I wish to provide a further update to Mr Jenner from his question yesterday in relation to the cost of workers being sent to Finland for local fit-out of the vessels. As I had indicated, a lot of the local content was required to be installed during the build of the new vessels. In most cases, suppliers had considered the need for any specialist expertise required as part of installation and factored the travel costs as part of the cost of the goods. They were not paid separately by TT-Line and are therefore unavailable.

In relation to the question on notice taken by the Premier yesterday, I am advised TT-Line engaged a broker to seek a lease for Spirit IV and did not have any direct engagement with the Scottish Government. TT-Line was negotiating with a third party with significant experience in vessel charters, including international governments.

In response to a question from Mr Garland to the minister, Ms Howlett, I am advised by the Chief Veterinary Officer (CVO) he received the full laboratory results of samples at midday Friday 28 February 2025. A complex genetic testing process was undertaken to confirm this information.

The results confirm the species is Piscirickettsia salmonis. It is a member of a proposed new genus which also has the Tasmanian Rickettsia-like organism. They are fish bacteria that do not grow in humans and that are not a human or animal health or food safety risk.

The CVO determined there was no indication of a public health risk. I am advised by the CVO that there is no need for any emergency disease response plan. This matter remains under investigation, led by the Environment Protection Authority (EPA).


Salmon Deaths and Effect on the Community
Protest at Parliament House

[7.31 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to reflect on the stinky salmon summer this island has endured and there is no sign it is over. Fetid fish carcasses and unidentifiable chunks of dead salmon-something have washed up on beaches. We have seen horrifying images of thousands upon thousands of dead fish floating in pens, being funnelled out and ultimately dumped in landfill container by container.

The mass salmon deaths are a result of climate heating and packed pens of disease-ridden fish, the EPA told us. Salmon company vets have described the cause of the mortality event as multifactorial. We could not agree more.

It is a toxic mix of greed, cronyism, political donations and privatisation. That, together with the climate crisis, may mean the new normal for Tasmania's summer: a horrifying thought. Tasmanians should be able to go for a dip with our kids, cast a line or walk our dogs on our favourite beach. As usual, under the major parties, communities come last when they are at odds with corporate mates.

These are public waters. It is the public paying the price, but they are not taking it this time. It is the Neighbours of Fishfarming that delivered the rotting salmon to the EPA and demanded an investigation.

The community is not buying big salmon's BS that there is nothing to worry about - comparing stinking chunks of salmon fat with fish oil like the stuff you buy at the chemist. They are forming local groups and alliances to defend their coastlines. They are rallying on beaches like in Carlton Beach and Dodges Ferry, dressed in red, demanding change.

It is not just on salmon. In the north and north-east, they are also stirring on forests. The forests that were reserved under the Tasmanian Forest Agreement are now on the chopping block again under the Minister, Mr Abetz. I had the pleasure of visiting some of those forests over the summer break and they are breathtaking: towering eucalyptus, massive ferns, trickling streams full of life, a multitude of animals, threatened or otherwise.

This is what the Liberals call wood banks. Yes, in a climate crisis, they call them wood banks and I cannot mention forestry without reflecting on Forestry Tasmania's illegal logging. In 2013, hectares were logged and burned, but it was not FT's land, it was Crown land. When the government talks about illegal activity in our forest, who is really the criminal? Just last week a logging contractor was found guilty of assault on a peaceful protester. I have lost count of how many times the Liberals, cheered on by their alleged opposition, made unfounded allegations about conservationists. They demanded apologies and condemnation from the Greens. Yet, when it comes to violence in our forests, we know it is not the Greens movement. We are proudly committed to nonviolent action. Every time it has been the loggers. Maybe it is your turn, Premier, minister Abetz, to condemn the contractors found guilty of assault last week. 

Finally, it is on that note, that I want to reflect on yesterday's protest on Parliament House - the people's House. As you said in this place yesterday, those individuals will be investigated for any laws they may have broken - or any slate. It should not take people getting on this building's roof to be heard by the decision-makers inside. We have an obligation to the people of Tasmania and to future generations and we should all be on a bound to defend democracy. After all, we know that democracy is fragile -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, I will hear the member in silence. I do not want to miss a word of this. 

Dr WOODRUFF - more so than this building itself, even. We know the erosion of rights, scrutiny and accountability is much more damaging than some boots on sandstone.

As for the planet, the Greens will always stand with its defenders, whether it is on the beach at Dodges Ferry or Verona Sands, in the forests near Lilydale or Saint Mary's, or at Parliament House.

We will not stand in silence and let Lutruwita to be logged, burned, privatised or poisoned.


Association Abruzzese Annual Summer BBQ
Hobart Hurricanes - Big Bash Title

[7.37 p.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to speak about a couple of things that happened over the summer break. 
In January, the Association Abruzzese held their annual summer BBQ at the Italian Club in Hobart. The Association Abruzzese is a respected and historically significant Italian community and volunteering organisation with a tradition steeped in the celebration of Italian culture, community, good food and the commemoration of landmark events in the history of Italy. 

Culturally, the Abruzzo region of Italy is steeped in literary tradition and was walked by some of antiquity's greatest poets and thinkers. Ovid, author of Metamorphoses, trod the fields of the ancient Abruzzo, as did Sallust, historian and praetor of Roman Republic. More recently, Pope John Paul II was said to reflect and pray often in the hills of Abruzzo. It is a region marked by excellence, beauty and the very spirit of Italy; progress, passion and heart. 

It is wonderful to think that a community and organisation born of a place steeped in such significance has made its mark on Hobart, Tasmania and Australia more broadly. I attended the barbecue and really wanted to acknowledge that the wider Italian community have contributed so much economically and socially to Tasmania, as they have all over the country. Are we not fortunate to live in such a wonderful place with such great friendships and a diverse community?

Another event I attended over the summer break was the Hobart Hurricanes maiden Big Bash title when they played the Sydney Thunder at Ninja Stadium in January. Fantastic event. I think I saw you, Honourable Speaker on the way. We caught the ferry over with my family. I have three young children who are absolutely fanatical about cricket and the Big Bash. They are just starting to understand it. I have a particular six-year-old who is absolutely obsessed to the point where he just wants Hobart Hurricanes and cricket everything. He loves Mitch Owen.

Mr Barnett - Has he met Mitchell Owen?

Mr WILLIE - Yes, he did meet Mitchell Owen in the aftermath of the title and got a little photo with Mitch. Mitch is obviously a rising star. They were chasing 183 and he blasted the Thunder players all over the park. He smashed a 39-ball century, equalling the fastest 100 in BBL history. I have seen some clean hitting in my time. I was fortunate to be over the river back in the day when Adam Gilchrist played an international there. I believe he scored 172 and was hitting them everywhere. I think Mitchell Owen was hitting them cleaner than that day. Every ball will look like it was going to go for six. The crowd was going mental. They were all calling out his name, Mitchell Owen. Even my two-year-old does it still.

Is it not fantastic that Tasmanians get behind sport like that? I believe there is a deep cultural undertone in our support for sport. We are islanders, we understand that it is us versus the world and when people take on our sporting teams, we get behind them en masse and it was a sellout. I was fortunate to go to the qualifying final too, which was also a sell out and I went to a number of other games and it was just a fantastic experience and I cannot wait until we have more premium sport content in Tasmania which we richly deserve. 

I know that Tasmanians will get behind it because we love this place, we love our sport and the Hurricanes have given a great example to people to make sure that they are open-minded about the future.


Dunalley Footpath - Non-Conforming Petition

[7.40 p.m.]
Ms BUTLER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I seek the leave of the House to table a petition that has been prepared but unfortunately does not conform with the Standing Orders.

Mr Barnett - Have you circulated it?

Ms BUTLER - Yes, I already spoke to your Leader of Government Business and the Greens and Independents. 

Dr Woodruff - We did not get it. 

Ms BUTLER - You did. I spoke to the members of your team. 

Leave granted. 

Ms BUTLER - This is a petition that has been signed by 24 petitioners. It mirrors the petition which was tabled this morning to do with the footpath for the residents of Dunalley. I will read the electronic petition into the record. 

To Honourable Speaker and the Members of the House of Assembly, Tasmania. 

The petition of the undersigned citizens of Tasmania draws to the attention of the House the lack of a footpath on the eastern side of the Arthur Highway from Bay Road to Bay Street in Dunalley. This section of road serves over 30 houses, an approved 8 block subdivision, 16-42 Arthur Highway and residents of Boomer Bay. It is also used by visitors to the area. The absence of a footpath poses significant safety risks, particularly for young children walking or cycling, people pushing prams and elderly residents walking along the edge of the road. 

Recently, there have been incidents where individuals have fallen or been injured while trying to avoid traffic. A traffic count from 2022 indicated that 2,200 vehicles travel to the highway daily, with 9 per cent of those being large vehicles, such as B-doubles, semi-trailers and buses, particularly, during the peak tourist season. The vehicle traffic is projected to increase to 2,970 vehicles per day by 2033, further escalating the safety concerns for pedestrians. 

Your petitioners therefore request the house to consider working with the local council and the state government to fund the installation of a footpath on the eastern side of the Arthur Highway from Bay Road to Bay Street to improve the safety of residents and visitors in the town of Dunalley. 

Signed, by 24 petitioners. 

This is on top of the petition that was tabled, this morning. 

I thank Bob Brakey, who is with us this evening. He was also here this morning. He was responsible for the paper petition. Bob is a resident of Dunalley and lives on the Arthur Highway with his lovely family. Bob used to also be very much involved in the Dunalley Primary School and has raised his family in that area and is extremely well connected. He managed to have over 700 people sign the paper petition which complements this e-petition of 24 petitioners. Noting, that there are 300 residents of Dunalley, that is really a significant achievement. Thank you very much. 

I would also like to thank our former Lyons member, now Labor federal candidate for Lyons, Rebecca White, who has also assisted in relation to helping Bob and the people of Dunalley in relation to getting this petition up and running. 

We understand from Sorell Council that they are interested in building a footpath of sorts. It has been requested for nearly a decade, I believe. There is an idea that they may be interested in putting a gravel pavement there. We would appreciate - and also from our conversations with people in Dunalley and the area - that they would appreciate for that to be a concrete paved footpath. There are people with mobility scooters and prams and so forth, and it would be more fitting for the community if they could have that. 

I also thank Christian Harvest, who also was responsible for obtaining these electronic signatures of this petition. Let us hope we get a really good outcome for the people of Dunalley with this.  


Forty-second Annual Truck Run

[7.45 p.m.]
Mr SHELTON (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I rise, this evening, to pay tribute to the 42nd running of the annual Truck Run, which was held last Sunday, 2 March 2025, and organised again by the wonderful members of the Tasmanian Truck Owners and Operators Association. Starting at Glebe Gardens in Launceston, a huge procession of trucks made their way towards Longford, winding out through Norwood, Kings Meadows and onto the Midlands Highway towards Perth. People lined the streets to watch myriad vehicles taking part, with trucks horns sounding along the 60 kilometre route to acknowledge the crowds. Finishing up at the Longford Showgrounds, all trucks were parked and a gala day began.

Sadly, this year the Truck Owners Association lost one of their own the night prior to the run, Bob Melack. Bob had been a part of the association for many years and his presence was missed on the day. As a tribute to Bob, all trucks in the procession travelled with their lights on and he was remembered by all who took part in the drive.

It is estimated almost 200 trucks were entered into the procession this year, which is a testament to the popularity of the fundraiser. Crowds filtered into the showgrounds, with a gold coin donation requested for entry. Rides, food, and drink and the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) display simulator, as well as hundreds of wonderful trucks on display kept families busy for hours.

Children screamed with joy as they clambered over the rigs and rides with many photos taken and family memories made. Raffle and silent auctions were run with sponsors and donors contributing a huge array of prizes for the fundraiser.
Organisers of the event headed by Roz Bonner and Rob Bales start their preparation at least six months prior to the event gathering sponsors, raffle prizes, and donations along with the permits and all the paperwork required for the day. A huge amount of volunteer hours are put into the organisation and running of the day which has raised over 35,000 last year and had tallied over 102,000 for the past four years.

Although the amount raised this year, 2025 is yet to be raised and finalised it is hoped that the RFDS will once again receive a significant donation. That will be of a large proportion, of course. A testament to the crowd and the number of trucks, it is going to be a very good fundraiser for them as I was there on Sunday.

Funds raised assist the RFDS on maintaining aerodynamical infrastructure and to operate its physical health, mental health, and dental outreach services in rural and remote areas of Tasmania. The Flying Doctor Service plays an essential role in the health and wellbeing of many people in Tasmania and they have operated in Tasmania for more than 64 years.

You only have to speak to people, especially in the vast electorate of Lyons, to realise the impact that the service has on the lives of those who have used the service. I hope the hugely popular day can continue and will continue into the future. I thank the committee and the drivers and the owners for their time and effort to make the day the successful community day that it is and their ongoing support.

When you look at the hundreds of rigs that were there, 180 odd, I believe, there is a big effort by, first of all, the owners to allow them to go there and the drivers who commit their time on a voluntary basis to clean all the rigs up in support of the RFDS. It is a fantastic day. Again, I just admire the work and effort that the volunteers put in and the sponsors put in so that there is a great day ahead. The money always, of course, as we know, goes to a great organisation.


Sharon Holbrook - Tribute

[7.50 p.m.]
Mrs PETRUSMA (Franklin - Minister for Health) - Honourable Speaker, it is with great sadness today that I rise to speak on the recent passing of Sharon Holbrook. Sharon Holbrook was an incredible, inspiring and dedicated woman who will be sadly missed by her beloved family and the Aboriginal community in Launceston. I want to send my deepest heartfelt condolences to her family, the Elders Council of Tasmania and the Tasmanian Aboriginal community.

Sharon was a board member and chair of the Elders Council of Tasmania, which she loved. Whenever an Elder passes the Aboriginal community reflect on the connections, values and a lifetime of sharing, storytelling, family and community.

During this week, Sharon will be spoken about with kindness, shared memories, and the impact that she made on her community. For those who knew Sharon, she did not mince her words and got straight to the point in conversations. 

In November 2024, Sharon and other elders reconnected to Cape Barren Island. This was significant for her, to go home to country, to walk the beaches, to yarn with community and to be with the elders. Sharon loved sharing during NAIDOC Reconciliation Week events.

Christmas lunch with the elders was also very important to Sharon. It was a time for the elders in the community to gather together over a meal at the end of the year. Sharon loved sharing culture with young people through workshops and enjoyed delivering Welcomes to Country.

Sharon always made herself available to engage with agencies and to provide an elder's point of view on issues. This is now a time of intense grieving and sadness for many Tasmanian Aboriginal people and for all who knew her. Family, friends, and the community will miss Sharon greatly.

Vale, Sharon Holbrook, and rest in peace. You will be missed greatly by us all.

The SPEAKER - I will take some indulgence and add my words to that if that is okay, members.

Aunty Sharon was a very dear friend. She was very well-cared for by her family in those last days. They are definitely grieving, but what a life well-lived. Sharon was a member of the Stolen Generations and her return home was powerful.


Paul Sean Kelly - Tribute

[7.52 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, this evening I acknowledge the life of Paul Sean Kelly, who died on Sunday, 23 February at the age of 32. Paul died of complications associated with motor neurone disease (MND), 'the beast', which he was diagnosed with 10 years earlier. On Saturday 1 March there was a Thanksgiving Service with family, friends and others to pay respect to his family and the man himself. His parents Lyne and John, siblings Jacqueline and Dean, and the extended families and loved ones were there to remember his extraordinary life.

He had a solid group of friends who regularly visited to play chess or even to take ice baths right along with him on his journey. Carers too were thanked during Saturday's service. MND is an unrelenting disease requiring around-the-clock care. Paul had chosen people to look after him, whose respect for him was clearly reciprocated by his trust, love and friendship.

I first met Paul soon after his diagnosis, almost nine years ago, when his dad, John, received the Citizen of the Year award from the city of Hobart. Paul's disease was just taking effect, with some muscle weakness making it difficult to stand, and Paul's search for answers had begun. Whilst I did not see Paul much for a number of years, I did have more contact with his dad, who by then had been elected to the Hobart Council after a highly successful campaign that Paul curated using his myriad journalistic and campaign skills, despite his advancing illness.

Their search for ways to deal with the march of MND was just as tenacious, taking them on many amazing journeys and adventures together. Paul inspired the formation of the community group Safe Water Hobart and he was the key member, heart, soul, and mind. Paul was aware that the work of Safe Water Hobart was not going to benefit his condition materially. His worldview of service was the motivation.

Over the years Paul's mobility diminished. MND weakens and then paralyses muscles. For Paul, it took a number of years until eventually he was only able to communicate by his computer using retinal recognition. John had recorded Paul's voice earlier and using AI, words Paul typed with his eyes could be spoken with the sound of his computer-generated voice.

Paul used that voice for good. He addressed the city of Hobart's Water Committee. He provided evidence at the United Nations Special Rapporteur on toxics and human rights, to Dr Marcos Orellana, when he was here in Hobart. He even narrated a short film on water pollution in the Derwent called Contaminated, something you can view on YouTube or on the Safe Water Hobart website.

A major risk factor for MND is the neurotoxin, BMAA (β-Methylamino-L-alanine). BMAA is produced by most species of blue-green algae. Algal blooms are occurring more frequently in Tasmania, caused by increasing water temperature, reduced water flows and excess nutrient runoff.

Despite intensive research, MND still lacks an effective treatment. It has been estimated that MND diagnosis have increased by 250 per cent in the last three decades. Genetic factors have relatively minor role in MND causation, but environmental factors must be involved. This was something that occupied Paul's sharp mind, and he has researched this intensively. Paul also wrote a book of poetry called Through My Eyes, inspired by the life lessons that someone with MND and facing death is somehow free to consider, or as was the case for him.

Clearly, he was a deep thinker, a very good friend, an advocate, someone who continued to be curious and courageous, someone who sought answers and who, in many ways, expects us to continue seeking these answers. To quote Paul:

The great thing about dying or facing the prospect of death is that it helps open you up to the deeper feelings, the more important feelings of who you are. 

This grace inspires me, as it does many, to continue Paul's work so that it is not in vain. The lesson is deep and it is a gift that Paul imparted on many who knew him.

Vale, Paul Sean Kelly, 5 May 1992 to 23 February 2025.

Members - Hear, hear.


Diabetes Australia - Eighteenth Pollie Pedal

[7.57 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Deputy Premier) - Honourable Speaker, First, I commend and thank the member for Clark, Helen Burnet, for her most beautiful contribution in honour of her dear friend Paul, who had motor neurone disease. For me, that is very special, with my dear dad. He had motor neurone disease and died in 1985. He had the privilege of being a former ambassador for Motor Neurone Disease Australia. I really appreciate your contribution, and those who care for people with MND and their families. I pay tribute to Neale Daniher and others who raise money and awareness of people with MND. I also commend MND Tasmania for the wonderful work they do to provide support to people with MND and their families. 

In the moments tonight, I pay tribute to those involved in the Diabetes Australia Pollie Pedal, which occurred last Friday, Saturday and Sunday, on the weekend of 28 February to 2 March. It was an absolute ripper event, the 18th Diabetes Pollie Pedal. It started in 2006. We did have some years where we did not participate, in and around COVID and post-COVID. It was absolutely great to be back in the saddle on those days.

I have participated in every one of the Pollie Pedals since that time, and every day, except for last Sunday when I had other work commitments. I wanted to say thank you to Diabetes Australia and Justine Cain for getting behind it, and all those involved in making it happen. In particular, thanks to Shae and Ange Clair and Simon, but there were so many others as well.

I want to say thank you to our sponsors, the Rapid Relief team, IGA Tasmania, Norske Skog, MAIB, St. Lukes Health Insurance and Bishops Barristers and Solicitors, and there were so many others who helped on our fundraising effort. To the cyclists Geoff, Dario, Di, Barry, Grant, Ricky, Allison, Scott, Melissa, Beau, Justin, Patrick, Martin, and Matthew or Matt, and just a shout out as well for Russell and Xavier James who had to pull out at the last minute. They both have type 1 diabetes like me and sadly could not come as a father and son combination.

It was a really terrific event launched by Her Excellency, the Governor of Tasmania at the Hagley Farm School. I am a little bit biased in favour of the Hagley Farm School, as a former student, and it was so good to be there.

Thank you to Jeanagh Viney, the principal, and all the members of the school. The children were so respectful and supportive and encouraging to the Pollie Pedallers. A shout out to Charlie from grade 4 who has just recently been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. I met his dear mum and dad, Carissa and Jesse Medwin, and it was great to give encouragement that diabetes need not hold you back. You can achieve your full potential with diabetes along the track. Of course, we were greeted by relevant members of the local councils including Stephanie Cameron, the Deputy Mayor at the Meander Valley Council and Matt Garwood in Launceston, Georgetown Council representative at their community barbecue on the Friday night and the Northern Midlands Council Mayor on the Sunday, so I was really appreciated to get that support. As I say it was fantastic encouragement and support. 

Thank you, especially as I say to Her Excellency for her contribution and likewise the COO of Diabetes Australia, Craig Sedgman, they have made some lovely contributions to the Polypedal and encouraged us along the way.

It was a ripper event. Looking forward to this time next year to raise awareness and fundraising. We have raised just short of $40,000 for the DiaBuddies program in Tasmania. It is a diabetes program that supports young people with diabetes and Type 1 and it is a ripper event. So far we have covered more than 5300 kilometres, and we have raised over $890,000 for diabetes programs and research in Tasmania.

It is great to be involved and be part of it and I thank all those that have been involved. A great tribute to you all.


Smithton - Child and Family Learning Centre
Stanley - Road Upgrade to Highway

[8.02 p.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to speak on the Adjournment about two issues that are really important across the Circular Head community and they have their origin as carry over from the last state election and it has been some time really since the government has provided an update on these projects.

The first is the development of a Child and Family Learning Centre in Smithton, which I might add, Labor in 2018, committed to actually building and delivering those services across the Circular Head community, but at the last state election by the Liberal and Labor parties committed and there has not been a lot said by the government since about this really important project for the local community.

I wanted to read into the Hansard tonight on the Adjournment a piece from the Advocate that was published prior to the last state election which talks about the need for the centre. I wanted to put it on the record. An Arthur River mum is calling for much needed funding to be put into the development of a child and family learning centre at Smithton. Sophie Pilkington and her two children, aged one and three, travel an hour into Smithton four days a week for work and to shop. By the time they arrive, her children want to run around and have a break, while Mrs Pilkington wants a safe place to change her baby and breastfeed. However, at the moment she said that neither are really possible and that she has nowhere to go.

I know a lot of mums from the area, they avoid coming to town or they come into town and rush as fast as they can so they do not have to change and feed their babies and then rush home.

The mum has spoken with members of both Liberal and Labor parties about investing in Circular Head's very own Child and Family Learning Centre and it would be a game changer for me, she said.

I would be able to connect with other mothers and fathers in what I consider an isolating and rural town and if I had any concerns about child development or any support it would be all in the same building and I would know where to access this. The closest centres to Smithton are in Wynyard and Burnie and that is too far for some mums and families to travel.

I went to the one in Wynyard and thought, wow this is amazing and exactly what Circular Head needs.

Mrs Pilkington currently sends her children to the non-for-profit Circular Head childcare centre but the centre is fully booked and has 226 children on its waiting list. Circular Head children's services manager Lynette Dunlop said a child and family learning centre would be absolutely fantastic for families in Circular Head.

A lot of our families that are coming through our long day care were not seen until quite a while later because we are at about approximately a six to 12 month waiting list for a position. So, if any of those families have got any concerns or anything like that, or they are new to the district, they have got nowhere to go, they have got no support systems in place and it is really hard to keep those families here.

I wanted to share that with the House tonight because I think it highlights some of the issues around access to childcare services, but also, more importantly, access to support services for families across the Circular Head region and so I would ask for an update from the Minister for Education on the establishment of the local enabling group, whether in fact that has actually happened and who the membership of that is, and also an update to the House on progress being made on the establishment and development of an identified site and a centre for the Circular Head region.

As you can tell from what I have shared with the House tonight, there is an absolute need for this service in the Circular Head community. 

The other project that I want to touch on very briefly is the road from Stanley to the highway, the Bass highway, which has been pencilled for an upgrade for a very long time, and dates back to the 2021 election or before. It was an election commitment that was sought from the Stanley Chamber of Commerce in Circular Head who wanted to see that road upgraded not only for the tourist industry and people coming in and visiting beautiful Stanley, but for locals as well. The road is in pretty poor condition. A lot of the edges need work done on them. It needs resealing. The government committed to $10 million towards that project in 2021. Just after Christmas, minister Vincent committed to a portion of that road. The original commitment by the government was for that road to be redesigned, resealed, and upgraded in its entirety out to the Bass Highway to the intersection. It seems like that has changed. 

I would like to know why and I would like to get a commitment from the government that they do intend to do those further upgrades right along that entire road network because it is in dire need of an upgrade. If they do not, then in fact they have broken their election commitments to provide $2 million to upgrade that road.


State Service - Hiring Freeze

[8.07 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, in Question Time over the last two days the government have made much of the word 'right' in revelation to their planned job cuts: right size, right shape, right service. The government is hoping that their dull repetition will lead Tasmanians to believe they are doing the right thing as they take the razor to our public service and implement their hiring freeze on non-essential services. However, repeating something ad nauseam does not make it true. 

As much as the government want us all to believe they are doing the right thing, Tasmanians see through their propaganda. They know this government's actions are completely wrong. A freeze on hiring workers in the public service is a job cut that plots a path to increased pressure and stress for workers and more service failures in a system that already too often fails to meet the needs of Tasmanian people.
Cuts to the public service will have very real impacts on people in Tasmania. They are wrong actions couched in wrong language that will lead to wrong outcomes. They are an absolute betrayal of the people of Tasmania and the incredible workers who daily give themselves to providing services for us. The government's use of spin and jingles is not contained to this chamber. 

Yesterday, the secretary of the Department of Health emailed workers across Tasmania's health service about the hiring freeze on so-called non-essential staff. The e-mail is truly something else. It calls what every Tasmanian apart from those in government knows are job cuts, a refocus, a refresh, a renewal and re-profiling. What a load of euphemisms and doublespeak that does nothing but demean, devalue and insult the intelligence and hard work of Tasmanian health workers. The Secretary's e-mail continues by suggesting natural attrition is a solution to the financial woes of the state.

The health service is already struggling to meet demand. Patients are waiting too long for ambulances, emergency care and essential surgery. Allowing staffing levels to passively drop by letting positions fall vacant and then quietly wiping them off the books is an abrogation of the government's duty to provide healthcare. This is an appalling disrespect to Tasmanians and health workers. The Secretary goes on in the e-mail to suggest committed, experienced staff can simply be replaced with younger, lower level staff. We need new graduates to be entering our workforce but not at the cost of losing the experience and skill of long-term staff.

After all this kicking health staff in the guts, the Secretary suggests health workers should seek EAP (Employee Assistance Program) counselling to deal with their stress. Your jobs are not secure. Our actions will actively increase your stress but here is a little EAP session or three that will help you through. What an insult. What about this non-essential mumbo jumbo the government keep throwing at us? They continue to refuse to provide a definition of non-essential. Nurses and doctors seem to be considered essential most of the time, but what about all the other health workers? Allied health workers are essential, but they do not seem to be recognised as such by the government. Cleaning staff are essential. Food services, maintenance, and administration staff all play an essential role in ensuring Tasmanians get the healthcare they need. 

Here is a memo to the government on what actually is right: 

When it comes to our health system, right service is ensuring enough staff and health services are available to provide the right treatment on time to every sick Tasmanian who needs it.

The right-shaped health system is a system staffed with a range of experienced health workers who are highly valued and respected for their expertise and skills.

The right-shaped health system also recognises that every worker employed in the health service is essential.

The right-shaped health system values staff and communicates with them clearly and honestly without resorting to slippery, empty words that do harm.

The right-sized health service employs all the workers who are needed to meet the health needs of Tasmanians.

The right-sized health service also recognises that vacant positions leave a gap in service provision that flows into gaps in care.

The right-sized health service fills vacancies and matches staffing to service need.

The Greens call on the government to scrap their weasel words and propaganda and direct the secretary: to withdraw this demeaning, disrespectful email; to recognise that all staff in our health service provide essential contributions; to ditch their staffing cuts that will only damage Tasmanian people and the workers who care for them, and instead commit to investing in the health of Tasmanians and the incredible workers who keep our health system functioning.

Tasmanian people and health workers deserve the right treatment. The government must do better.


Launceston General Hospital - Kitchen Services

[8.14 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, last year during question time, the former health minister, Guy Barnett, admitted to this place that the government would be moving the kitchen services of the Launceston General Hospital off-site as part of the LGH redevelopment. This was a pretty serious revelation and it raised serious concerns amongst staff at the LGH as well as the broader Launceston community around patient care and food quality to be served to hospital patients.

There is still room in the LGH master plan for the kitchen services to stay on-site and that is what those workers want and it is what patients want too.

Recently, I stood with many workers from the LGH and the union that represents them, the Health and Community Services Union, and called on the new minister, Jacquie Petrusma, to reverse that decision and to recognise that it would be inevitable that moving the food services off-site would not only affect 94 jobs of kitchen and food services staff, but it would also mean a reduction in food quality. That is inevitable. It is not a criticism of the cooks and the chefs involved. It is because they would have to move to a cook-and-chill system where food is prepared off-site. It is then chilled and then reheated at the hospital. That is what happens at the Royal and there has been a marked diminishing of the quality of the food at the Royal.

It is a really serious issue. Workers and patients at the LGH are quite rightly proud of the food quality. People who work across Tasmanian Health Services (THS) sites note that there is a difference in the quality of food compared to other sites. Not only that, but it will affect jobs.

There are going to be people who will be markedly impacted negatively by having their job move from the LGH site in the city, potentially off-site as far as the airport. Health and Community Services Union (HACSU) delegates, workers from the LGH and I stood together recently in Launceston and called on the Minister, Mrs Petrusma, to reverse that decision to ensure that those jobs will not be affected and to keep the Launceston General Hospital food services on-site at the LGH.


Cars for Kidz

[8.14 p.m.]
Mr FAIRS (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about a wonderful community event that I have been involved with for many years. That is Cars for Kidz. This annual free event was held at the National Automobile Museum in Launceston on the Sunday just gone. I am proud to say it was one of the biggest events yet.

Cars for Kidz is the brainchild of Alan Stevenson, a man who has incredible passion for children with disabilities. For the past 20 years, Alan, himself a disabled Tasmanian due to a Targa accident, has provided so much joy and excitement to youngsters of all ages through this event.

It is a unique opportunity which not only gives kids a chance to admire stunning muscle cars and hot rods and things like that, but also experience the thrill of riding in them. I have been truly honoured over the years to be one of the many drivers who generate huge smiles that we see on the faces of these fabulous young people - and their parents for that matter.

I want to highlight that Alan and his band of loyal volunteers year after year have been there to support kids with disabilities and give them this fun opportunity that most of them would never get to experience otherwise.

To Phil Costello at the National Automobile Museum, thanks once again for allowing we rev-heads to take over your facility for the occasion. Also to the media, event sponsors, food and drink vendors, thank you so much for your support. To the many owners of these amazing hot rods and the passion and love that they put into these cars, it is incredible. They are like a family member. They are absolutely stunning. They turn out year after year, donating their time, and at sometimes it is very costly due to fuel. Thanks so much for your busy, unwavering support. It is amazing.

To Tasmania Police, who were there. They were a huge hit with their police motorbike and the car in particular, giving kids rides with the lights going off and the sirens going off as well. It was just fabulous.

Also to the kids and their families, we love, absolutely love giving them and putting on this event for you. Thank you so much for your support for 20 years. We look forward to keeping it going. People ask me why I continue to be involved with this event, and my answer is always the same. I have to say, there is no greater joy in my life than seeing kids and their faces light up, their smiles, their laughter, the love of the roaring engines as they take a spin in a hot car. It is an amazing experience to be part of.

Cars for Kidz is a celebration of community and inclusivity and I am so proud to be part of it and speak about it tonight. 


Salmon Deaths and Effect on the Community

[8.17 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight with no joy whatsoever to talk about the mass salmon deaths and the disgusting, fetid pollution plaguing southern Tasmanian waters and beaches over these last weeks. As is well known, we Greens are staunch supporters of clean, publicly owned waterways, cherished and maintained for their ecosystem services and amenity, their recreation values and the spectacular vistas they afford coastal communities. When not blighted by industry, we are strong supporters of strict environmental regulation and clear lines of accountability and transparency, both in public reporting and responsibility. That is where we are long opposed to the establishment impacts and immunity of industrial scale caged salmon farming in Tasmanian waters. 

What began as a niche industry has, in true Tasmanian style, been supercharged through government policy and lax regulation into a behemoth that is seen scaling up in existing waterways and expansion and agenda into new waterways and an aspiration to crack open new coastlines across the north and the north-west, all aided and abetted by government and cheered on by Labor. Any pretence of local family business is gone with the sale of all three salmon producers to multinational corporations, some with corruption plagued backgrounds, disregard for environmental sustainability and all with a single motivating factor: profit for shareholders. Aside the noise, light and marine debris pollution of industrial salmon farming, the environmental pollution impacts are largely out of mind and thus out of sight.

Only through the 2018 deaths of 1.3 million fish and near collapse of the Macquarie Harbour ecosystem and then likely demise of a prehistoric skate have the issues of dissolved oxygen levels, toxic mass, mats of fish species and disease been discussed in depth. Eventually, the overwhelming weight of both science and public opinion forced government and the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) to act and reduce biomass levels, but it is not enough.

These last weeks, we have checked chunks of fettered salmon product littering local beaches and whole decomposing carcasses washing ashore. The lead has finally been blown off exactly what a stinking, sorry mess the salmon industry really is. Biosecurity Tasmania have confirmed that the disease causing the mass die-offs is salmon Rickettsia septicaemia, the same disease that caused up to 90 per cent mortality of Chile's farm salmon stocks in the 1980s. Well over a million fish have died so far, exacerbated by warming waters. Many have been sucked up, dumped in fish bins and transported to rendering facilities to be turned into fish oil, feed or fertiliser. Others - many, many others - have been dumped in landfill. The rest, it seems, have decomposed on site, drifted away from the nets or fallen off the barges to turn up on our coastlines in a foul, toxic reminder of just how rotten this industry and its political backers are.

The impetus here of the EPA has also been exposed, with the inadequacies of environmental protection legislation and subsequent regulations writ large. There is still no answers on the EPA's website. There is not a single statement on Huon's or Tassal's or Salmon Tasmania's. As for the government - crickets, not a word until yesterday's Question Time, and even that was evasive and unreliable. 

Dr Woodruff - Shameful. 

Mr BAYLEY - This incident is not only a shocking indictment on the salmon industry and the government; it is a sign of things to come. It has to be a turning point. Hopefully, consumers will be rightly alarmed about the disease, antibiotics, deaths, pollution, and the complicity of the system. Before anyone screams 'jobs', spare me, as the industry mechanised and jobs were lost to automated feeding managed online in an office in Hobart and no-one said a word. When multinationals cut and run because climate change fuelled compromised profits, the jobs will go with them, just like the King Island jobs when JBS abandoned the meatworks. Better surely to shift on land while you can.

To finish, let me acknowledge the environment groups working hard to inform the public where the government has failed.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.5_D=28.8_C=0.82] Neighbours of Fishfarming and the Bob Brown Foundation have both stepped in to find and film these pollution events and inform the public about their impacts and their extent. We look forward to the Premier's promised accountability and transparency about this pollution incident and recommit to work out reforms to Tasmania's environmental and pollution control legislation so it is fit for purpose, effective and works for those most important in this equation - Tasmanians and our environment.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=58.9_D=10.3_C=0.57] The House adjourned at 8.21 p.m.

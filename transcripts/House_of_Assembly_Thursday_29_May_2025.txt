Thursday 29 May 2025

The Speaker, Ms O'Byrne, took the Chair at 10.00 a.m., acknowledged the Traditional People, and read Prayers.


RECOGNITION OF VISITORS

The SPEAKER - Before calling the leader, I will acknowledge that we have year 6 students from The Hutchins School joining us today. I hope you enjoy the proceedings on this very special Budget day.

Members - Hear, hear.


QUESTIONS

Spirit of Tasmania IV and V - Engine Issues

Mr WINTER question to MINISTER for TRANSPORT, Mr ABETZ

[10.01 a.m.]
Yesterday, you and the Premier repeatedly denied there was an emergency shutdown on either of our new Spirits. Can you confirm that approximately two months ago, a gas cylinder or similar object was sucked into the thrusters of Spirit IV, which caused an overload and an automatic emergency shutdown of the thrusters?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question - yet again seeking to talk down the Spirits which will be so transformative for the Tasmanian economy. Yesterday, the question that was asked related to a most recent incident and situation. Having had that denied to him, he now comes into this place with a different story, with a different question, trying to find fault.

In relation to the matter that he raises, I am not aware of any detail in that regard. If I can get information by the end of Question Time, I will, of course, report that to the House.

Suffice to say that we, as Tasmanians, can now have confidence in the new management of TT-Line that have this project back on track. The government has recognised the difficulties of the Spirits and the world markets in relation to the ship build, and in relation to a matter that is of Tasmania's making, the berths. When confronted with the situation, you can either decide to wallow around in it like the Leader of the Opposition does, or you can ask, 'Where are we at now?'

Mr Winter - We are not even allowed to talk about it now? Just ignore it, he reckons.

Mr ABETZ - 'What is the way forward? How do we improve things?' That is what the government and I have sought to dedicate ourselves to -

Mr Winter - Dedicate but do not talk about it.

Mr ABETZ - Might I add, in relation to this issue with the Spirits, not once has there been a positive suggestion emanating from the Leader of the Opposition.

Mr Winter - Bring them home.

Members interjecting.

Mr ABETZ - He shouts out 'Bring them home' when he knows it is going cost more to have them at home.

Mr Winter - Yet you are doing it.

Mr ABETZ - Then he says it is going save money -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ABETZ - for the taxpayer. The two things do not add up.

Mr Winter - Yet you are doing it.

Mr ABETZ - The Leader of the Opposition needs to realise that he cannot continue to talk out of both sides of his mouth, because after a while he going to get caught out. He will be exposed in relation to the negativity that he continually parades. On the one side he says, for example, that we are going to get more money out of the GBEs for the benefit of Tasmanians and then in the next breath he wants us to give discounts to big business.

Mr Winter - You have sent TT-Line broke.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ABETZ - The two things simply do not add up.

I will seek information from TT-line in relation to the specifics of the question. I reiterate that, as a government, we have confidence in the new board and management of TT-line. We look forward to progress to getting these vessels here and servicing the needs of our tourism and productive sectors.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired. Before I take the next question, I will just note that we have taken that one on notice. I remind members that that was a very specific question that could have had a very specific answer. Just because you have three minutes, minister, does not mean you need to take it. On other matters, it might stop the interjections that we have going on.


Tasmania Police - Roster Arrangements

Ms BUTLER question to MINISTER for POLICE, FIRE and EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Mr ELLIS

[10.05 a.m.]
At the election you promised to deliver a relief pool to ensure safe staffing levels at our 24-hour police stations. This promise followed a 2-20 literature review by Tasmania Police that found clear evidence of performance decreases and the risk of operational errors significantly increases as sleep debt accumulates, particularly across consecutive night shifts.

How does your government justify Tasmania Police returning 24-hour workers to the Ottawa roster that finishes with seven consecutive night shifts? With the knowledge it risks officer safety, wellbeing, and ultimately the safety of the public, should you not be supporting the 6x6 and 4x4 rosters that the work group had trialled and ensure it is enshrined in the next enterprise agreement with Tasmania Police officers?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for Lyons for her question. Our government is absolutely committed to delivering even greater frontline police servicing for the Tasmanian community. That is why we have record numbers of police in Tasmania today. That is why we have a record recruitment program going through our Academy as we speak. That is why we have the highest investment in police of any state jurisdiction in Australia.

The reason why we do that is because it has helped to deliver the most trusted police force in Australia as well. We are at the highest levels for policing satisfaction in the community of any jurisdiction in Australia. We have the highest likelihood that the community will regard our police as trustworthy, honest and acting with integrity. Our investments that we make in Tasmania Police are at record levels and will continue to grow under this Budget -

Ms Butler - You cut the funding by $35 million.

The SPEAKER - Interjections will cease.

Mr ELLIS - with a $1.7 billion investment in policing services which continues to deliver dividends for our beautiful communities around the state. 

The SPEAKER - I will draw the minister to the question.

Mr ELLIS - In terms of rostering, obviously  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=27.9_D=3.7_C=0.69] the Police Commissioner and her executive team have been working closely  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.9_D=26.2_C=0.84] with the union and our workforce of police officers across the state regarding rostering trials for a number of years. We have trialled a range of different rosters. The Tasmanian Industrial Commission currently has a matter underway on rosters, so I am not going to comment on the specifics of that. 

What I will say is that we expect police leadership and the police workforce to work together in good faith [Bookmark: Phr4_O=58.9_D=5.0_C=0.63]  regarding rostering matters, and we want to deliver rosters that deliver great frontline services, as well as reduce fatigue. There are clear concerns that the six on, six off rosters have a fatigue management issue with them, so it is important that we get this right. Broadly speaking, the Ottawa roster is the award-compliant roster, and we will continue to work with Tasmanian police. 

I can say to the House that what we will not do is sack one in 10 police officers in Tasmania. We will not be sacking 108 police officers -
 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=93.5_D=2.7_C=0.23] 
Ms BUTLER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. Can the minister please answer the question that was put in front of him?

The SPEAKER - The minister has addressed that question. Having answered the question, the minister can resume his seat if he would like.

Mr ELLIS - Thank you, Speaker. I am happy to add further to my answer. What we will not be doing is doing what Labor and the Greens did, which was defunding police. 

Ms Butler - Point of order, Speaker.

Mr ELLIS - When you had a chance, Ms Butler, under Labor, you defunded police.

The SPEAKER - Minister, you will resume your seat. I think I have made it very clear to people I ran into around the hallway today that I have a really bad throat. If I have to yell at you, I am going to just kick you out. I will hear the point of order.

Ms BUTLER - Can the minister remember the Standing Order of relevance and answer the question, please? 

The SPEAKER - The minister has answered the question. Having answered it, I will invite the minister now to resume his seat. I will take the next question. Standing Order 48, if anyone is wondering why I am getting a bit funny on that. Leader of the Greens.


Aboriginal Reconciliation and Justice - Government Commitment

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.09 a.m.]
Next Tuesday is the Aboriginal Reconciliation Week breakfast, and I hope you are attending. Uncle Jim Everett-puralia meenamatta is the key speaker.  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=153.6_D=29.8_C=0.78] I asked a question for him to you in parliament last year. He said, 'The Palawa of Lutruwita/Tasmania never ceded their rights under law in country.' Unfortunately, you refused his request to meet and discuss it. Premier, since colonisation Palawa have always demanded a treaty and land returns. Three years ago, your government promised to deliver a truth-telling process and a treaty. 

Last year you met with Tasmanian Aboriginal community representatives and promised you would progress a treaty. Yesterday, your government abandoned this promise. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=183.8_D=16.0_C=0.79]  Even worse, your Cabinet colleague Felix Ellis used that as an opportunity to celebrate a win in a culture war. With this level of betrayal, how will you look Tasmanian Aboriginal people in the eye next week and tell them that your government is committed to reconciliation and justice?

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=201.5_D=1.1_C=0.63]  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=208.9_D=5.4_C=0.78] ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. I will be attending the breakfast next week, as I have done, not last year unfortunately, but for four years prior. It is always an uplifting experience, but we are also reminded of the tragedies and our very dark history in Tasmania.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=235.2_D=3.7_C=0.64] My views on Aboriginal reconciliation are well known [Bookmark: Phr15_O=240.8_D=4.0_C=0.73] . My advocacy for a yes vote in the referendum [Bookmark: Phr16_O=245.9_D=23.5_C=0.85]  is well known, and my support for practical measures to close the gap, which we are a signatory to nationally. We are ensuring that we are investing in social enterprise - the Palawa Business Hub; the opportunities for the [Bookmark: Phr17_O=270.9_D=21.6_C=0.82]  abalone licences, which we announced last December. That is very good example of social enterprise and reinvesting to support Aboriginal people and communities, including the area of training and  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=294.6_D=2.0_C=0.56] the wonderful opportunity of [Bookmark: Phr19_O=299.1_D=5.9_C=0.78]  First Nations produce and product, which we can celebrate.

Prior to yesterday's announcement of the Closing the Gap initiatives, truth-telling, and healing - in my view was a major step forward, and, if I read most of the views from Tasmanian Aboriginal people and respective organisations, it was overwhelmingly positive. I recognise that our focus on a pathway forward when it comes to truth-telling and healing is not only a necessary step, but a necessary focus.

We need to go through truth-telling and healing before any more formalised agreements. There is no doubt in my mind that we can do far better as a nation and as a state in acknowledging the dark past, but also in partnership, investing in those key areas of reconciliation, to use your word today, but also those Closing the Gap initiatives. We are failing when it comes to incarceration rates.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - Thank you, Premier, for those words. You talked about the comments yesterday being overwhelmingly positive about truth-telling. They definitely were. There were also many other comments of real sadness and a sense of betrayal about not progressing a treaty. Are you personally committed to progressing a treaty with Tasmanian Aboriginal people?

The SPEAKER - I will allow the supplementary. It is a little bit close but the Premier did refer to commentary made about the announcement, so I will allow the supplementary.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I am very personally committed to reconciliation. Before any formal agreements, we need to have a journey of healing and Truth-Telling so that Tasmanian people and Tasmanian Aboriginal people have a true understanding of our history, as dark as it is, and the intergenerational trauma that Tasmanian Aboriginal people have suffered.


Tasman Highway Upgrades

Mr O'BYRNE question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE, Mr VINCENT

[10.15 a.m.]
It has been six years this week since your government announced the upgrade of the Tasman Highway between the Hobart Airport Interchange and the causeways. The proposal relating to the section of road from the airport to the first causeway heading east from Hobart has been marked by appalling communication, desperate blame-shifting, and failure to meet deadline after deadline. Overall, it has been a display of utter incompetence by your government.

After six years, you do not have a plan, you do not have the necessary approvals, and you are far away from even considering breaking ground on this section of highway, which is in desperate need of an upgrade. Minister, when will the public see the latest concept plans for this project and road? How can you defend this shambolic episode?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I will not necessarily thank the member for the question, only because I drive that road a lot - more so than any other member of this House. It has been a source of frustration for the local communities down there for decades.

Over the last eight years, we have seen a lot of work being done on that, such as an overtaking lane done up out of Ironstone. The cutting at Midway Point was just one of those projects that everybody loves to see happen. The causeways created a bit of hassle, and so has the section of road from the end of the airport through past the golf club. There has been a lot of work done on designs for that. In June 2022, the plan submitted at that time to the EPBC (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act) - the federal department indicated that offsets were needed, and in negotiations, whether they be full or part, created issues with that happening. In recent times it has been awkward to come up with a full solution that was going to see that section of road, and it is a dangerous section of road. I have seen the accident reports in the early days on that and it is quite comprehensive.

Since then, over recent months, the development application was allowed to lapse purposely for the reason of realigning the road in an easier way for it not to interfere with the offsets that were required on certain properties there. In December 2024, we submitted plans to the federal department once again. For simplicity, they do not look at plans or concepts unless there is a fair bit of detail there, for very good reasons, I should imagine.

We are still waiting for those plans to come back with the stamp from the EPBC, and that is what I find frustrating at the moment, because I feel it is a roadblock, not just for that section that you have mentioned, but also for the two causeways. It is a major hassle and I spend a lot of my time explaining that to locals. As soon as those approvals are granted, we will be finalising the last bits of the tender documents to go out to tender. We hope that to be later on this year, but we cannot take that next step and do final costings and documentation until we get that approval.

Once that approval is given and the tenders go out, then we will be starting work as quickly as possible. How that progresses - we are still working through that with the causeways as well so we minimise the disruption to local people on a section of road that is already heavily transported.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired.


Family and Sexual Violence Command - Job Security

Ms BUTLER question to MINISTER for POLICE, FIRE and EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Mr ELLIS

[10.19 a.m.]
Twenty-seven workers in the Family and Sexual Violence Command fear their jobs are at risk, with no certainty being provided over their future despite their contracts expiring in coming weeks. These are critical positions in the Safe Families Coordination Unit, Reportable Offender and Child Exploitation Targeting Unit, family and sex crimes divisions and the Arch centres. Will you guarantee the contracts will be extended, or better, that the positions will be made permanent? If so, will it be reflected in the Budget this afternoon?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. It is important to note that the dedicated efforts to support adult and child victim-survivors of sexual harm and family violence led to the creation by our government of the new Family and Sexual Violence Command in 2023. The command includes 86 police officers, 35 state servant positions created or brought across to the command, including within the Safe Families Coordination Unit, the Reportable Offender Child Exploitation Team and, of course, noting the discussion around Daniel's Law, the Sex Crimes Unit and a team that coordinates the Arch multidisciplinary centres. This has really been a nation-leading innovation of this government. and I pay tribute to my predecessor in Mrs Petrusma for her incredible work to deliver the Arch centres, which we are now expanding.

As part of the Arch pilot program, most of these State Service positions were created as fixed-term. As the Arch centre project now transitions from a pilot to a business-as-usual program, these positions will be made permanent following a review of the team structure as part of that transition. The Arch program has been made permanent with the plans for the third Arch nearing finalisation, which will be based in the north-west. I look forward to updating the House very soon on the north-west facility.

Given that the Family and Sexual Violence Command is still a new command and the Arch is a pilot moving to business as usual, the existing State Service fixed-term contracted positions supporting Arch are being considered and progressing through permanent recruiting programs where applicable. A total of 14 fixed-term contracts are in this category. There will be no reduction in staff numbers or impact on service delivery. Staff are being kept up to date and Tasmania Police will continue to engage with unions as appropriate. I am advised that there are no changes to policing resources for the command either.

Supplementary Question

Ms BUTLER - A supplementary question, Speaker?
The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary.

Ms BUTLER - If the minister can also outline for us, as subsequent information - we also asked about the positions in the Safe Families Coordination Unit, Reportable Offender and Child Exploitation Targeting Unit and the family and sex crimes divisions as well as the Arch centres.

The SPEAKER - The original question was about 27 positions, I think, in full. 

Mr ELLIS - That is right. I think the member may have missed, but all those are part of the Family and Sexual Violence Command, as I mentioned in my answer, so my broader comments apply.


Macquarie Point Urban Redevelopment Agreement - 30 June Deadline

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.2_D=6.6_C=0.67] Ms JOHNSTON question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF 
 
[10.22 a.m.]
Yesterday, your ministers were unable to answer a simple question. Maybe you can help. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=32.8_D=25.1_C=0.71]  A key condition of the $240 million federal funding agreement, the Macquarie Point Urban Redevelopment Agreement is the requirement that your government deliver a finalised housing plan by 30 June developed in consultation with the Commonwealth which ensures the delivery of housing at Macquarie Point, including a portion set aside as affordable, essential worker or social housing. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=58.8_D=4.7_C=0.73]  Will you meet the 30 June deadline? Will you release the plan publicly?

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=72.2_D=23.9_C=0.76] ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. My advice is that we are progressing, working with the federal government. I have no reason to doubt, at this point, given the advice that I have received, that we will not meet the 30 June deadline. We will meet the 30 June deadline  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=97.0_D=5.4_C=0.70] is the advice that I have. We are working through those matters now with the federal government in a collaborative way.

Supplementary Question

Ms JOHNSTON - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms JOHNSTON - The second part of that question was: will you release it publicly? 

The SPEAKER - Premier, you may not have heard the second part of the question: 'Would that be released publicly?'

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=118.0_D=22.0_C=0.74] Mr ROCKLIFF - I will seek advice in terms of public release. At face value, I cannot see any reason why we would not release it publicly, but I will be seeking advice on that. 

The SPEAKER - Thank you. If I could clarify, will you take that on notice or will you just come back to us? 
Mr ROCKLIFF - [inaudible]


Great Eastern Drive - Mobile Coverage

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=142.6_D=4.7_C=0.81] Mr FARRELL question to MINISTER for INNOVATION, SCIENCE and the DIGITAL ECONOMY, Ms OGILVIE

[10.24 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=148.2_D=24.9_C=0.85] My constituents on the east coast have had a gutful of poor mobile phone coverage and poor excuses from the telcos and your government in failing to address the problem. This is a public safety issue. It hurts local businesses and undermines the region's reputation as one of our great visitor destinations. What are you doing to improve mobile coverage on the Great Eastern Drive, or after 11 years, has your government given up on regional Tasmania?

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=174.6_D=3.3_C=0.36] ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=180.2_D=25.1_C=0.67] Honourable Speaker, I thank you for the question. This is an area - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I am sure the minister is quite aware of where to go with this answer. You can stop giving advice.

Mr Winter - She needed help finding that event at the Taroona Bowls Club too.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition.

Ms OGILVIE - This is an area of great passion for me. As I know, the member is aware prior to coming into this place, I was a general manager at one of the large telcos, so I do have a good understanding about coverage and the various layers of government that are responsible for various elements of our network. Australia's 3G mobile network was formally shut down on 28 October 2024. I am sure you are aware of that. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=214.1_D=30.0_C=0.80] 

We work very closely with our telecommunications service providers to monitor reports of connectivity issues across the state. They have recently done some really important work down at the peninsula as well, knowing how the tourism sector fires up over summer. Some mobile coverage issues have been reported after this shutdown. I believe that some in that territory have been reported. They relate to that peak seasonal demand that I am talking about on existing 4G and 5G  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=244.2_D=24.9_C=0.69] network infrastructure and 4G and 5G mobile black spots in areas previously fortuitously covered by 3G. Some of that may be the matters to which you refer. 

As everybody in the Chamber would be aware, telecommunications provision in Australia is a responsibility of the federal government. It is in the Constitution. I have written many times  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=269.8_D=5.4_C=0.88] to your federal colleagues to say, 'Please, on behalf of the great state of Tasmania, can we have an improvement to our overarching telecommunications infrastructure?'

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on both sides, I would like to hear the minister's answer.
Ms OGILVIE - In particular, let me talk about the subsea cable issue in which I have been a very squeaky wheel with your federal government. I call upon Tasmanian Labor to do the same. Stand up for Tasmania.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on both sides - minister, can I ask you to stop for a moment so that everyone can be quiet and we can hear the answer from the minister, because I cannot over your noise. 

Ms OGILVIE - Stand up for Tasmania. Get onto your federal colleagues and say to them that we deserve our fair share.

Mr Winter - Why did Marcus Vermey not want you at the bowls club? That is the real question.

Members interjecting.

Ms Ogilvie - It is completely unfair that Tasmania, unlike the mainland states and territories, particularly those on the eastern seaboard - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left. 

Ms OGILVIE - are treated as a second-rate state when it comes to federal investment.

Mr Winter - Why was Simon Behrakis invited and you were not?

The SPEAKER - Leader of the opposition. 

Ms OGILVIE - We work very closely with Telstra in particular and the federal government to do that black spot program, but it is up to you guys because you are Labor and your federal colleagues control the string - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left. The minister will direct her answer through me to stop having the interjections. 

Ms OGILVIE - I seem to have triggered them, Speaker. It is completely within your control to speak to your federal members as I have done - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Ms OGILVIE - to demand that Tasmania get its fair share. 

Supplementary Question

The SPEAKER - Am I hearing a supplementary from Mr Farrell?

Mr FARRELL - Yes, Speaker. The minister attempted to wipe her hands of the problem -

Ms Ogilvie - Not true.

The SPEAKER - Minister.

Mr FARRELL - by suggesting that this is a problem only for the federal government. My question to the minister is: if all she can do is write letters to the federal government about this issue, what is the point of having a minister in the state parliament at all? 

Mr Winter - Hear, hear. Great question. 

The SPEAKER - The minister seems very keen to answer that question. She jumped up very quickly.

Ms OGILVIE - I am very keen to answer this question. 

Mr Winter - The portfolio has been restored. 

The SPEAKER - Leader of the opposition. 

Ms OGILVIE - Exactly.

Mr Winter - What a triumph.

Ms OGILVIE - Not only have we restored the portfolio, but we have improved it and expanded it. I am very pleased to be the minister for this portfolio - 

Mr Winter - Do you have some line items now? 

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition. I am sure you want to hang out for the day.

Ms OGILVIE – not just in telecommunications in which I have had - I think - almost a 20-year career including working on network infrastructure right across the world, including Silicon Valley - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members for Bass and Lyons, that will do. 

Ms OGILVIE - including developing our Digital Economy Strategy, which is really important to the state of Tasmania. Let me talk a little bit about that because telecommunications network infrastructure is essential to that, which is why we need to make sure we get our fair share of investment from the feds so that we can participate in the global digital economy in the same way that every other state and territory can. 
Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Member for Franklin. 

Ms OGILVIE - This is not just about the economy, but this is about what we do in health. This is about running good government. This is about digitisation of our processes. This is about ensuring that our young people who are innovating and developing businesses get a fair go. 

Members interjecting.

'Adult Crime, Adult Time' Policies - Infringement on Human Rights

Ms ROSOL question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.30 a.m.]
Last week, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples released a damning statement on the nationwide crisis in youth justice. They said:

Children are suffering undue harm to their safety and wellbeing as well as to their educational and life prospects as a result of short-sighted approaches to youth criminality and detention.

In particular, they raised concerns about moves to introduce so-called 'adult crime, adult time' laws across the nation. They said these new and proposed state laws are:

Incompatible with basic child rights. 

Following these unequivocal statements from the UN, surely you can see why we are so alarmed about Police Minister Felix Ellis's push for these exact laws. Premier, will you rein in your police minister, ditch the adult crime, adult time plan and make sure your government protects the rights of Tasmanian children?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question, and a well-researched question at that. I have said many times that we are committed to the Youth Justice Blueprint and having trauma-informed but also more therapeutic pathways for young offenders to ensure that through those pathways and those areas of diversion resource to ensure that our young people who commit crime are able to have the opportunity, of course, through those resources and through that better support to be productive members of our community and positive community citizens. We also have to ensure that people are held responsible for the crimes that they commit and to ensure that we and young people understand fully the consequences of such very serious crimes.

Minister Ellis is simply stating the facts when it comes to 57 of young offenders committing 50 per cent of the crime. We also cannot resolve from the fact that some people in our community feel very scared and very threatened. We need to ensure that we have the appropriate police resources on the front line, which we have continually built up over the course of the last decade to ensure that our communities are safe.

It is about striking the right balance. I said myself that all options need to be on the table. We have not committed to adult time for adult crime, but it is a matter that has been implemented in another state of the nation, and they are pointing to some success with respect to that.

What I am committed to is our pathway forward with the Youth Justice Blueprint and we are implementing that under the leadership of minister Jaensch. Minister Ellis's responsibility is to ensure that our police resources are appropriate, our response times are appropriate, and the support for our police officers is appropriate when it comes to the challenges of youth crime in our community.

I will also make the point that I do not want young people characterised -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Ms ROSOL - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms ROSOL - The UN has been very clear that adult crime, adult time is a clear violation of the rights of children and young people. The Premier in his answer just now failed to rule that out. He has failed on previous occasions to rule that out and that is quite damning. I ask the Premier: why is it so hard to listen to the UN? Do you think that your Minister for Police knows more than the UN?

Mr ROCKLIFF - We seek and take advice from many quarters with respect to this very challenging issue. I do not want to see an escalation of youth crime in Tasmania as has been presented in states such as Queensland and Victoria. The most important people to listen to are in our community and their expectations in keeping them safe and their expectations and their -

Dr Woodruff - Why do we have a commission of inquiry?

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Mr ROCKLIFF - expectations in ensuring that we have contemporary model of therapeutic care and therapeutic youth justice system to ensure that young people who, for often no fault of their own, diverted to a pathway of crime, and serious crime at that, given the circumstances and their horrific lived-experiences, often from birth.

Macquarie Point Stadium - Community Concerns

Mrs PENTLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.36 a.m.]
Yesterday, your government arrogantly rejected two constructive motions relating to the stadium.

The SPEAKER - I will remind members that we are not to reflect on votes of the House. Can you restructure your question in a way that does not reflect on a vote on the House? Everyone has been here for over a year now, so -.

Mrs PENTLAND - With Labor's doting support, the prospect of engaging with key stakeholders was struck from this House and instead we heard the same tired political tacks on anyone who dares to question your pet project.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass, I will allow you to start again, but you have to ask your question without reflecting on a vote of the House.

Mrs PENTLAND - Polling shows that just 35 per cent of Tasmanians back your stadium. Since first announcing the project, support for your party has sunk from 42 per cent to 29 per cent. When will you realise that you have a problem on your hands and start listening to the valid concerns of the community?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I always look forward to your questions and you are doing a very good job in representing your community. I also want to point out the generosity of the Leader of the Opposition who has allowed his backbench to ask some questions today as well, when every journalist is locked up in the Budget line, which I think is a fantastic thing [Bookmark: Phr3_O=36.4_D=18.5_C=0.50] .

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Great bit of teamwork. He asks all the questions every other day, but when the journalists are nowhere to be seen -

Mr Winter - Have you forgotten yesterday or the day before? 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Your day in the sun, Jen. Your day in the sun, Casey. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order members on my left.  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=55.3_D=22.0_C=0.64] The House will come to order. I will remind the Premier that I have been around a long time and I remember when he was in opposition, too. Thank you. Premier has the call. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - I remember opposition too, honourable Speaker. I look forward to Meg's question because that will be fantastic. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - You will also refer to members by their title. Thank you. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - I used to sit exactly where the member sat.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left. Premier, you have been asked a question by the member for Bass. I suggest you address it now you have had more than a minute.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=78.8_D=10.7_C=0.46] Mr ROCKLIFF - Dr Broad's moment in the sun is at 12 midday today, I understand. 

The SPEAKER - Premier.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=91.4_D=2.7_C=0.52] Mr ROCKLIFF - I will be online.

Mr Winter - Why are you doing that?

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=96.4_D=0.8_C=0.16] Mr ROCKLIFF - Josh should be there.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Go, Shane, go.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=102.4_D=0.4_C=0.24] The SPEAKER - Members on my left. The House will come to order.  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=105.2_D=1.8_C=0.60]  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=109.3_D=11.3_C=0.67] The member eventually got her question out. There is only just over a minute for the Premier to address it please, or the Premier can resume his seat.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left will leave the Chamber if they keep interjecting. 

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=123.2_D=25.0_C=0.70] I thank the member for the question. We will disagree on the characterisation of the project in terms of 'pet project' and the like. I note your reference to polls. It would be a pretty poor leadership on anyone's part if they were driven by polls, recognising, of course [Bookmark: Phr12_O=149.1_D=0.3_C=0.95] ,  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=150.7_D=24.0_C=0.82] where the stadium is in terms of the public discussion. I believe we can move forward and the community will eventually embrace the tough decisions. 

Can I also say that the reference you made to the government's rejection, et cetera. The parliament made the calls; the parliament's decision on motions. Yesterday was a reflection of  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=175.5_D=4.7_C=0.82] parliament agreeing, disagreeing, we had amendments to bills [Bookmark: Phr15_O=181.1_D=12.4_C=0.61] , some motions did not get up, some did. Yesterday was a very good example of a collaborative parliament working together.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=197.2_D=4.9_C=0.45] Macquarie Point Stadium - Land Acquisition Information

Mr JENNER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.40 a.m.]
I see the Treasurer - a lot of us are wearing black today in readiness for their Budget.

Members interjecting.

A member - Zinger.

A member - Carlton blue, navy blue.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=211.2_D=4.2_C=0.54] The SPEAKER - It was amusing, but I do think it is a dark-blue suit.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=217.6_D=8.5_C=0.63] Mr JENNER - Premier, yesterday I received a briefing that was offered by your government on the new enabling legislation and accompanying reports.  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=226.8_D=25.9_C=0.71] During that briefing, I raised concerns about part 3 of the legislation, specifically related to land acquisition. I was assured that all the land involved was either Crown land or council land, and that members of the Hobart City Council had been thoroughly consulted and were supportive of the arrangement. Imagine my surprise when I opened the papers today to find the Hobart Lord Mayor anything but supportive of this proposed legislation.

 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=253.5_D=9.7_C=0.68] My question, Premier: how can we trust any briefing your government provides on the stadium project to address my concerns when it seems the information was given was simply inaccurate?

The SPEAKER - The member's time for asking the question has expired.

 [Bookmark: Phr23_O=266.3_D=0.3_C=0.28]  [Bookmark: Phr25_O=275.9_D=21.2_C=0.78] ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I was not there at the briefing, but can I vouch for those who provide the briefing, that they provide absolutely accurate information. I note the Lord Mayor's comments. [Bookmark: Phr26_O=298.9_D=3.6_C=0.52]  The government has been advised that the POSS process may ultimately  [Bookmark: Phr27_O=304.5_D=0.5_C=0.47] not see the parliament consider  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=8.6_D=26.8_C=0.85] the matter until March 2026, which is nearly 12 months away. That would put the delivery of the stadium beyond the timelines agreed. As I referenced before, I am aware of the comments that Hobart City Council made in relation to land acquisition, I believe through the media. 

Importantly, the standard process for assessment of compensation  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=36.2_D=4.4_C=0.67] in accordance with the Land Acquisition Act 1993 will be undertaken. The acquisition  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=41.4_D=24.5_C=0.81] of land is administered by the Valuer-General and is an important factor in many government projects, which includes delivering this transformative infrastructure at Macquarie Point. Again, this is transformational. It is a precinct transformation.

If I look at other areas around Tasmania,  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=67.0_D=10.0_C=0.67] my predecessor recently spoke in the media about the Launceston Aquatic Centre and how divisive that was in the community at the time  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=77.5_D=7.0_C=0.78] and how people were against it, but are now fully on board. I use an even better example  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=86.1_D=1.6_C=0.80] with respect to the Living City.

Ms Dow - Council have done a great job, have they not?

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=90.9_D=1.1_C=0.83] Apologies, Deputy Leader?

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=93.9_D=6.6_C=0.73] Ms Dow - Devonport City Council have done a great job.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, members. It is not a conversation across the Chamber.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Yes, in collaboration with state and federal governments. There have been [Bookmark: Phr11_O=103.5_D=10.5_C=0.79]  matters about title differences and all those sorts of matters that had to be worked through in a very methodical and constructive way.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=114.9_D=3.6_C=0.83] I would hope and expect that Hobart City Council  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=120.2_D=28.7_C=0.82] are constructive and do not stand in the way of such an opportunity. 

The project has the potential to be completely transformative, as it has been in Devonport. It has transformed that city, but had absolutely massive opposition at the time. I commend those councillors at the time who showed great courage. Frankly, I am very proud of our government's investment in that as well, acknowledging the bipartisan support at the 2014 election  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=150.2_D=15.6_C=0.63] for that investment. Even Hobart City Council's own analysis found the stadium would bring over $143 million -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for the question has expired. 

Supplementary Question

Mr JENNER - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Mr JENNER - My question has not been answered. I asked the Premier  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=166.8_D=12.7_C=0.76] how could I trust any briefing when the information I was given was inaccurate? Did they not know - the government - at the time that Hobart City Council were not on board? I was told yesterday they were.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=181.6_D=4.2_C=0.58] The SPEAKER - I will draw the Premier to the question. He did say that he was not at the briefing, but as far as the Premier can answer that.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=188.1_D=28.0_C=0.78] Mr ROCKLIFF - My understanding is that the Department of Premier and Cabinet representatives met with Hobart City Council officials on Monday, and that no issues were raised in relation to this matter. That is the advice that I have. If it is contrary, then I will come and correct the record or add to my answer.  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=216.7_D=5.0_C=0.72] From official to official level, I believe it was a very constructive conversation  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=222.7_D=7.2_C=0.70] where these concerns were raised at that particular time. 


Conversion Practices - Bill for Banning

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=232.6_D=19.8_C=0.85] Ms HADDAD question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.45 a.m.]
You launched your leadership as a progressive social reformer. Yesterday, you announced you have given up on your long-promised treaty with Tasmanian Aboriginal people. Have you also given up on your longstanding commitment to ban conversion practices in Tasmania? Why has the parliament not seen a bill tabled yet?  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=252.8_D=6.6_C=0.77] Is it because you cannot get anything through your Cabinet room? Premier, who is in charge here? Is it you or Eric Abetz?

Members interjecting.

Mr Shelton - Very droll; it is Budget Day. 

Mr Abetz - When the journos are not around.

Ms Badger - Do not stand with your back too firmly to Eric.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Mr Shelton. Thank you, member for Franklin and member for Lyons, you will cease interjecting.  [Bookmark: Phr24_O=279.6_D=2.4_C=0.43] 

 [Bookmark: Phr23_O=273.1_D=4.9_C=0.63] ANSWER

Did you really write that, Ella? Did you?

Ms Haddad - I did, actually.

The SPEAKER - First of all, you do not get to ask her a question, and second, you can refer to the member by her appropriate title. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - I am pleased you asked a question on this day. It is fantastic. I look forward to the next question coming up -

Ms Brown - Ms Brown to you, thanks. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Ms Brown, thank you very much - the question coming up soon. Our government acknowledges that practices to convert sexual orientation and gender identity are harmful. The Justice Miscellaneous (Conversion Practices) Bill 2024 was released for public consultation. The consultation period for the bill was closed. As previously indicated, the government had received a large number of submissions during the public consultation period and the Department of Justice is working through those submissions.

Considering the varied and detailed feedback received, given the complexities of such a bill and the diversity of views, it is very important to get this right. It is complex. It is diverse. There may well be other parties and individuals across the parliament or in the other place that may bring forward legislation as well, which we will consider, as a parliament, should that be -

Mr Willie - You need help from the parliament.

Mr Winter - You cannot get anything through your Cabinet.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - should that come to fruition. My commitment is still maintained. Thank you very much Ms Haddad for the question.


Greyhound Racing - Taxpayer Funding

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.49 a.m.]
In his report titled 'The Financing of Greyhound Racing in Tasmania', independent economist Saul Eslake confirms what we have long known - 'Tasmania is throwing good money after bad', he said, 'to massively subsidise greyhound racing.' In the decade to 2022, attendance has declined by 37 per cent and each job sustained by the industry cost 91 per cent more. Tasmanians spend $12.57 per person on greyhound racing, more than double the national average. We are Australia's poorest state, with a crippling debt and cuts across government services, and you are prioritising life support for this so-called industry.

Will you admit it is time to end taxpayer funding for this cruel industry and redirect funds to health, housing and education, all of which produce a greater return on investment to the people of Tasmania? Instead of privatising GBEs, why do not you just stop pouring tens of millions of dollars every year into a loss-making stinker like Tasracing?

The SPEAKER - The member's time for asking the question has expired.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question.

Dr Woodruff - It is a pleasure.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We are investing $10 million a day into health, $9.9 billion over four years into education, $14.5 billion dollars over four years into our health system, and investing in other areas of priority including community safety, police resources, and other important matters. I do not want you to characterise in terms of priorities that we are not prioritising the matters that concern Tasmanians. This budget is all about ensuring that we are delivering that for now and into the future, that we are investing in cost of living and investing in those services for Tasmanians.

When it comes to racing more generally, the investment and the reforms we have made in the integrity provisions of racing have been considerable. Integrity will be the bedrock of the Tasmanian racing industry as it grows and continues to make a positive contribution to our community. With respect to the question at hand, the information that I have - and I was Racing minister for four years, so I have a good understanding of the racing industry and a good understanding of the racing industry having continuous improvement when it comes to animal welfare standards and integrity provision around wagering, which is so very important.

There is no denying the fact that the contribution of racing more broadly is over $200 million in economic activity for Tasmania and involves just shy of 6500 people across the state.

I do not like and I disagree with the characterization about investing in education and investing in health. In fact, we will have 100 per cent of our school resourcing standard coming to effect next year with our new bilateral agreement with the federal government, whereas Victoria, for example, will not reach 100 per cent until into the 2030s, if my information is recalled correctly.

It is important to know the context, that the vast majority of the funding provided to the Greyhound Code is funded by commercial revenues. The Greyhound Code directly generates revenue outside the deed, which has increased by about 130 per cent over the past five years via mechanisms such as race field fees, media rights and sponsorship. I recall -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. 

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary.

Dr WOODRUFF - The Premier talked about the investment in health and education and so on, and the costs of that. Do you accept the EMRS polling that shows that the majority of Tasmanians, over 70 per cent, do not want public subsidising of the greyhound industry, and that it would be better to spend our precious resources on health and education services, which are being cut by your government?

The SPEAKER - I am not convinced that is a supplementary question, but you do have that statement on record now.


Marjorie Harwood - Risdon Prison Transgender Policy

Ms HADDAD question to MINISTER for CORRECTIONS and REHABILITATION, Ms OGILVIE

[10.53 a.m.]
The minister would know about the sad death of Marjorie Harwood, who passed away in hospital following a brutal attack during her incarceration at Risdon Prison. One of the concerning aspects of the case is the discovery that the Tasmanian Prison Service (TPS) does in fact have a transgender policy: Director's Standing Order 2.15. It has been in place since 2017, but it was not followed in Marjorie's case. It allows transgender prisoners to be housed in the prison of their gender identification, provided there is no compromising of safety, security or good order of the prison. Can the minister provide an assurance that the policy is now being adhered to and that transgender prisoners are housed in accordance with that Director's Standing Order?

Further, the family has long been fighting for a coronial inquest. The coroner has now determined not to hold an inquest. Will the minister commit to working with the Attorney-General to meet with Marjorie's family to discuss the case?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. That is a very serious and important question on a very sad circumstance. I have looked into this matter as well and so I can inform the Chamber that the Tasmanian Prison Service, a great workforce, has a detailed policy in place for transgender prisoners and prisoners with innate variations of sex characteristics. This policy prioritises safety and treating prisoners with dignity and respect.

This policy is currently under review, as you would anticipate. It is under review in close consultation with the Department of Justice's LGBTQI+ Reference Group, which is important, and will be retitled the Transgender and Gender Diverse Prisoners Policy when finalised. That is in relation to the first part of your question, where are we at.

One change under the updated policy will almost certainly be the introduction of a new panel with membership from the LGBTQI+ community and all those with lived experience, which will provide advice to the director of prisons - and we have a new director - on the placement and management of transgender and gender diverse prisoners.

It is not appropriate for me to comment on particularities of individual cases, but what I will say is that I will always stand up for every single individual who feels that their circumstances merit conversation, further consideration and dialogue. I am very happy to do that with the Attorney-General at all times.

I feel that the policy priorities that we are now setting and the trajectory we are now on prioritises that safety issue and treating prisoners with dignity and respect. I would also like to say that our staff there do a really good job with what they have to work with. We understand that this sector is a difficult sector. I am the biggest supporter of the TPS and our workforce.

I also recognise that we can do better, and we can do better when it comes to training and understanding and context and all of those things which in the day-to-day operation of a prison may not have delivered the results that we would have hoped for.

The answer is yes. I will speak to the Attorney-General. I am aware of it. We are working on it. I think this is one of these issues that is a little bit above politics, so thank you for the question.

Supplementary Question

Ms HADDAD - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms HADDAD - Thank you to the minister for an explanation of the review of the policy. Can I ask the minister to clarify for me that while that is being reviewed, the existing Director's Standing Order is being adhered to? Second, the minister agreed to speak to the Attorney-General, but the question was: would you meet with the family of Marjorie Harwood along with the Attorney General?

Ms OGILVIE - I have just had the benefit of some information from the Attorney-General. I think he feels likewise as well. Subject to legal considerations, particularly if something is before the courts - I am not aware of where it is up to in that matter - I am certainly happy to meet with the family, but I will speak with the Attorney-General first. 

In relation to the work that is being done, I think everybody has been made very aware after that situation occurred of what should occur. Whilst this is being formed up to be more contemporary and in line with national standards, certainly the TPS will make sure that things are managed properly. It is a little unfair to sort of suggest - I am not sure you were doing this - that Standing Orders would be of an old nature and that this would occur again. We certainly have a very clear -

Ms Haddad - The current one is good. I just want to know if it is being adhered to while you are reviewing it. 

The SPEAKER - You have asked your supplementary. 

Ms OGILVIE - Yes, thank you. I believe it is, yes.


Hillcrest Primary School Tragedy - Criminal Hearing Verdict

Mrs BESWICK question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF 

[10.58 a.m.]
The criminal hearing into the Hillcrest School tragedy is approaching its conclusion, with the magistrate due to deliver his verdict next Friday. Regardless of his decision, the outcome will have a profound impact on the community. Premier, what planning has gone into offering support to the families affected by the tragedy in the wake of the verdict? Can you assure the north-west community that services will be there when they are needed most?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. Tasmanians' hearts were broken on 16 December, 2021, when we lost six young people and others injured physically and mentally, and the trauma of others: young people, families, and vicarious trauma further afield as a result of that tragedy. Communications, as I understand it, honourable member, will be going out today to families in the local community. I am well aware of Friday 6 June when Magistrate Webster will hand down the decision in this matter. This will be a particularly difficult time for families of the Hillcrest Primary School as well as members of the wider community as you have so heartfeltly spoken of in this place on a number of occasions.

We anticipate there will be, quite clearly, considerable media and community interest in the decision. The resulting publicity and coverage may, and most certainly will, in a number of circumstances, cause significant stress, distress, and, of course, relived trauma for many people. We have been working with the Magistrates Court to put in place arrangements to support people who choose to attend the court proceedings. We have also been communicating directly with the families of the deceased and injured children.

As a result of the limited space at the Magistrates Court, members of the public will be unable to enter the courtroom. Instead, they will be able to watch the hearing at the paranaple centre on Rooke Street. The viewing area at the paranaple centre will be an extension of the court. Normal court rules will apply, and court security will be present. That means you will not be able to use your mobile phone in the viewing area and people there will not be allowed to use recording devices or take photographs. 

We know that some of the families are very worried about watching the court proceedings in a public area. That is why there will be a separate private area at the paranaple centre for family members who are unable to attend the court building, and we have people there on hand should family members have any requests or require support.


Kunanyi/Mount Wellington - Future

Mr BAYLEY question to MINISTER for BUSINESS INDUSTRY and RESOURCES, Mr ABETZ

[11.02 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=9.2_D=28.1_C=0.82] Your strategic review of Kunanyi/Mount Wellington asked Tasmanians their view on the future of the mountain so as to produce a vision document. According to your website, this part of the process was concluded in April and we understand you have received a vision report. We were informed it would be released publicly on 20 May. Can you confirm you have received the vision document? When will you release it [Bookmark: Phr4_O=37.4_D=6.6_C=0.84] ? Can you confirm you are seeking to change the document to undermine the vision of the community as expressed in the consultation process?

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=46.0_D=2.2_C=0.39] ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=50.6_D=3.0_C=0.87] The answer to the last part of the question is, of course, no. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=56.5_D=12.0_C=0.78]  What I and the department are working hard to do with a vision document is to ensure that it is a true reflection of the views of the people of Tasmania.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=68.9_D=14.6_C=0.85] The Mount Wellington precinct is a precinct that is owned and belongs to all Tasmanians. It is appropriate that all Tasmanians have an input  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=85.3_D=0.3_C=0.78] into that  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=87.7_D=10.7_C=0.84] review and that vision document. I have seen a draft of that vision document and I look forward to being able to release it relatively soon, but I wanted to make sure, as the department did, that it was a true and proper reflection of the consultations that were undertaken. That is what I have done and undertaken and will be releasing it in due course.


 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=125.0_D=22.4_C=0.70] GFG Alliance - Tasmanian Jobs and Debt - Liberty Bell Bay

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.04 a.m.]
News broke overnight that yet another of GFG's companies, Ferretti International Ottoway, went into administration with 150 jobs impacted in South Australia. Can you update the House as to any further discussions with GFG since Tuesday morning when you last updated us? Does Liberty Bell Bay or any of its associated entities owe money to the Tasmanian government?
 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=149.9_D=0.4_C=0.19] 
ANSWER
 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=155.4_D=26.7_C=0.82] 
Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. Noting the concerns in the community, I say first and foremost, the actions that we take as a government will be to engage with the company in a very sensible and productive way in the best interests of the people who are affected.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=183.4_D=10.0_C=0.81] We sat down with Mr Gupta on Tuesday afternoon. It was a productive meeting, as I have said. Minister Abetz was there as well [Bookmark: Phr17_O=194.9_D=28.0_C=0.78] . We expect greater transparency to government when it comes to the circumstances that are facing the company and look forward to ongoing engagement as we work through. We are all committed to ensure the sustainability of Liberty Bell Bay, as I say, in the interest of the 254 full-time equivalents and 30 full-time equivalent contractors,  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=225.4_D=1.2_C=0.89] to my information. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=227.2_D=20.7_C=0.87]  However, the broader community, should the plant close, would be devastated and there would be ramifications across the community, indeed, not only George Town but across northern Tasmania. That is why it is important to sit down and work with the company.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=249.6_D=1.6_C=0.76] As I said, I am very pleased with [Bookmark: Phr21_O=252.1_D=14.9_C=0.77]  the way that local management are engaging with and supporting their workforce. I am pleased with the engagement that I have had with the Australian Workers' Union (AWU) and their interest in this matter to ensure that their members are well looked after in terms of leave-provision and the like.

 [Bookmark: Phr23_O=275.1_D=24.6_C=0.85] I am also very keen to continue dialogue and discussion with the federal government. You have highlighted the matter in South Australia. This is a national issue, if not international issue, with respect to the circumstances of smelters. The national issue is most certainly prevalent [Bookmark: Phr24_O=300.9_D=4.0_C=0.73] , and we are very mindful of the circumstances, not only of Liberty Bell Bay, others and including Nyrstar as well, of which we will always engage with the federal government. As I said, I have written to the Prime Minister about our national approach to this issue and also have written more specifically regarding Liberty Bell Bay.

I am happy to take on notice the matter pertaining to your last part of the question and happy, honourable Speaker, to update the House at a later time when that information comes to fruition.

Macquarie Point Stadium - Federal Funding

Mr GARLAND question to MINISTER for BUSINESS, INDUSTRY and RESOURCES, Mr ABETZ

[11.07 a.m.]
Last week, you appeared on ABC's Change my Mind: The Stadium Debate where you effectively said that the $240 million would be withdrawn by federal Labor if the stadium project did not go ahead. This was the line you repeated yesterday in the parliament.

Minister, I cannot find one reference to the stadium in the funding agreement with the Commonwealth. The construction of the stadium does not form part of any conditions of the agreement. Do you or your government have legal advice or information from the Commonwealth to confirm the $240 million will be withdrawn if the stadium does not go ahead? If so, will you table it? If you do not have that information and have not been provided with that legal advice, will you correct the record?

ANSWER

Speaker, just because I do not have legal advice on a matter does not mean that I have to withdraw it. I think we can come to our own conclusions in relation to these matters. As I understand from discussions between the Premier and the Prime Minister, $240 million was made available to the state government for the development of the precinct. Fundamental to the development of the precinct is, I would have thought in anybody's language, the stadium. That is going to be the centrepiece of the development of the precinct.

If the stadium does not go ahead, then the development of the precinct will basically have to go back to square one.

Members interjecting.

Dr Woodruff - Go back to the plan that is already there.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Mr ABETZ - That is something that we are not working towards. That is not what we are working towards at all. We are working to the development, for the development of the precinct, for the shared vision between federal Labor and the state government, which I am now pleased to say is shared by state Labor opposition and the federal Liberal or Coalition opposition.

Dr Woodruff - Yes, so the federal Labor government - 

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens, it was not your question.

Mr ABETZ - Have I sought legal advice on the matter? No. On the plain reading of it, it is quite plain to me, and given the public statements of the Prime Minister, that that which I said is correct.
Supplementary Question

Mr GARLAND - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr GARLAND - Will you confirm that there is not condition of that agreement for the $240 million?

Mr ABETZ - Sorry, what is not the condition?

Mr GARLAND – That it is not a condition of the stadium going ahead. That that $240 million will be withdrawn, because we cannot see anything in there that suggests that if the stadium does not go ahead -

The SPEAKER - It goes to the original question the minister has addressed in his answer already, that he believes it to be conditional.

CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Caravan Parks - Support for Residents

Ms FINLAY question MINISTER for HOUSING, PLANNING and CONSUMER AFFAIRS, Mr ELLIS 

[11.11 a.m.]
Multiple constituents from Beauty Point and throughout the Tamar Valley have asked for an update on the work you are meant to be doing to support residents in caravan parks across Tasmania. There is ongoing trauma being experienced and they deserve to know the status of the work.


Bruny Island - Ferry Delays

Mr STREET question MINISTER for TRANSPORT, Mr ABETZ

Members of my electorate recently travelled with visitors to the state, to Bruny Island. They experienced significant delays getting on the ferry to return to Hobart in the afternoon. Can you please advise what the government is doing to fix this problem and ensure that Bruny Island remains a premier tourist destination?

The SPEAKER - I was going to give you the call, but I will take - just so you know, if you jump at the same time, yelling out actually does help. That is the only time you are allowed to yell at me.


Bus Driver Safety and Cuts to Half-Price Fares

Ms BROWN question to MINISTER for TRANSPORT, Mr ABETZ

Constituents of mine who work as bus drivers are concerned they will bear the brunt of your cuts to the number of people who can access half-price fares. As the roll out of the security screens has not been implemented on majority of buses, what steps are you taking to ensure drivers are safe and the public knows that they are not responsible for the changes of bus fares?


Dashain Festival - Venue for Multicultural Soccer Tournament

Ms BURNET question to MINISTER for SPORT and EVENTS, Mr DUIGAN

My question is from Subash from Glenorchy. The Nepalese Football Club of Tasmania is trying to organise an interstate multicultural soccer tournament in Hobart to coincide with Dashain Festival in September but cannot find a suitable venue with enough changing rooms, enough pitches and lighting facilities for visiting teams. Why are multicultural communities like theirs finding it so difficult to secure support for important community, cultural and sporting events which will also boost Tasmania's economy? Where is the real investment in grassroots sports facilities such as soccer? 


Waddamana Bridge - Replacement

Mr SHELTON question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE, Mr VINCENT

Waddamana Bridge, also known as the Bashan Road Bridge or Ouse Bridge, was the suspension bridge constructed approximately 90 years ago as part of the hydroelectric scheme and connected small areas such as Miena and the Shannon to Ouse and Osterley. It is owned by the Central Highlands Council and maintained by State Growth. Due to the loss of tension in the suspension cables in the north-eastern side of the bridge, it sadly collapsed in March 2024 and was impassable to any vehicles and has now been removed. Constituents are having to cross the river via the existing ford, which becomes dangerous in the winter months and rainy events. 

What discussions have been had for the replacement of the bridge and is there a completion date I can advise to my constituents?


ANSWER TO QUESTION

Spirit of Tasmania IV and V Engine Issues

[11.14. a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Minister for Transport) - Honourable Speaker, in response to the Leader of the Opposition's question, I have further information to advise the House. On 15 April, Spirit IV engaged all four side thrusters as part of a test while alongside at Leith. An hour into the test, a vibration was felt in one of the bow thrusters which was then shut down. Divers were deployed and a gas bottle subsequently was found in the unit. The bottle, which was not the property of TT-Line, was removed.

It was determined that the bottle had been lifted from the seabed through operation of the thruster. The matter was considered operational. The incident was not in any way associated with LNG issues recently encountered. 

Mr Winter - I will look forward to your apology for yesterday then. Will it come later or what?

Mr Abetz - In what parallel universe?

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - What? There was an emergency shutdown. 

Mr Winter - So it was not a shutdown?

The SPEAKER - Thank you. The House will come to order. 


MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Regional Jobs

[11.16 a.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House takes note of the following matter: regional economy and jobs.

Today, I am talking about the regional economy and jobs today. What could be more important to regional economy and jobs than the Spirit of Tasmania and accurate information coming from the minister? Yesterday, I asked about whether there had been any emergency shutdowns to either of the new Spirits, and the answer was no. In fact, they carried on about it, then admitted that there was, in fact, a shutdown - in quite detail, exactly as I had already been advised. They might try to use semantics about the words used, but the fact was that once again Labor had better information about what is going on with our Spirits than the government did, just like we did when we asked if there had been a bailout of the Finnish shipbuilder. We asked that question to the Premier 12 months ago and he did not know. He did not know that his own government had bailed out a Finnish shipbuilder with $80 million of Tasmanian taxpayer dollars. He did not know, because the former treasurer had not told him. They did not know, they said, until April that the berth would not be ready for our new ships. They did not know. 

I will tell you what they did, when they did know, when they did find out in April: they did not tell anyone.  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.1_D=17.4_C=0.81] They did not tell Tasmanians, did not tell the tourism industry that was gearing up, did not tell the companies carrying our freight, and did not tell the agriculture industry that needed it to move their freight onto the mainland.

Then they talk about transparency: 'How good are we, because 10 minutes before Question Time we told the truth about that one thing?'  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=47.4_D=14.2_C=0.81] Yesterday, they did not front up with a full answer about the shutdown of those engines. In fact, they pretended it did not happen or they did not know about it - which is just as bad. This government has been all at sea on the Spirits of Tasmania and is letting regional Tasmanians down.  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=63.2_D=27.8_C=0.82] That is obviously a huge issue.

What else is an incredibly serious issue for regional Tasmania is the situation we have with two of our major industrials, but also potential impacts on all four major industrials. I am concerned about the ongoing developments with GFG Group, and particularly more information that came out of South Australia yesterday.  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=91.9_D=5.0_C=0.46] I want to send our thoughts again to another 150 workers impacted by the administration  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=97.3_D=29.8_C=0.78] of yet another GFG company in South Australia yesterday. Our thoughts continue to be with the with the workers at Liberty Bell Bay in Tasmania, many of whom are being forced to take leave, many of whom face an uncertain future with their work. I want to send our thoughts to them and also at Nyrstar down in the south where the company is undertaking a strategic review. There is further reporting today in The Australian newspaper about the future of the Trafigura review and  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=127.3_D=25.0_C=0.79] what looks to be a request for support from the company for both state and federal governments to provide that support. 

I want to thank minister Tim Ayres for his engagement with me so far around this and his willingness to engage. I would like to see - and I have invited him, when the time is right, to come to Tasmania and  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=153.0_D=24.2_C=0.69] understand these issues as best as he can, so that we can have an Australia that continues to make things. The 'Future Made in Australia' policy is a really good one and something that minister Ayres is passionate about. I look forward to working with him around this.

It is important that GFG opens its books. GFG Group has a lot of explaining to do in terms of the way that its books and finances are being managed, the way that  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=177.6_D=24.8_C=0.81] the company structure is allowing companies - one particular component of the company - to transfer money to others, the complicated governance structure that continues to put pressure here on Tasmanian workers.

I have to say that I have great confidence in GFG's Liberty Bell Bay operation. As an operation it is filled with fantastic workers who are highly skilled.  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=203.4_D=3.7_C=0.88] It is an operation that has had significant investment  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=207.5_D=26.7_C=0.86] around a decade ago, but could certainly do with some more capital investment at the moment. We support those jobs and we want to make sure that there is a future for that. Frankly, there is an issue here about the viability of major industrials as the government continues to push forward with its transmission cost increases and its power price increases which have hurt our major industrials. 

As I said the other day, when I walk into  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=234.9_D=5.4_C=0.65] the boardrooms of these companies, the first issue that they have been raising with me for a long time now  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=240.7_D=5.2_C=0.81] has been power prices, particularly transmission prices, which have been going up and up.  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=246.6_D=13.7_C=0.82] We are calling the government to do two things: to work with the federal government to force GFG to open its books and be honest and transparent about what they are doing. I do not want to bail out a company that is just going to go and send the money somewhere else.

[11.21 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=263.6_D=24.3_C=0.76] Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Minister for Business, Industry and Resources) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, let us be very clear in relation to the Spirits - and this is the sort of mischievous behaviour that the Leader of the Opposition engages in. He asks me a question as to whether there was an emergency shutdown. The answer to that is an unequivocal 'no'. He then tries to reinvent his question today [Bookmark: Phr16_O=288.3_D=10.1_C=0.73]  and, as I read out in the answer, it was an operational matter. It was not escalated to be an emergency shutdown [Bookmark: Phr17_O=298.9_D=6.1_C=0.74]  -

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ABETZ - As you might imagine, I am not advised of every little operational matter that might occur with TT-Line. Emergency matters, of course, should be escalated. This was not an emergency matter, it was operational. That is why the answer provided yesterday remains clear, and on the record it has embarrassed the Leader of the Opposition, which is why he is now trying to reinvent the question into something that it was not yesterday.

It is interesting that in discussing regional jobs in Tasmania he did not touch once on the greatest provider of regional jobs in Tasmania, and that is the fish farming salmon sector. Forgotten, overlooked. Over 5000 of our fellow Tasmanians put bread and butter on their tables and pay their house mortgages courtesy of that very important sector. It is a sector which I know your shadow minister actually does understand. My commitment to that sector, I trust, was shown -

Ms Finlay - Minister, you know that Tasmanian Labor across all of our electorates supports the salmon industry. This is woeful off the back of last night.

Mr ABETZ - when I joined the community barbecue at Shipwrights Point on Sunday.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - I am sorry, Mr Abetz. That is your one and only warning, Ms Finlay.

Mr ABETZ - Then we can go to the forestry jobs - also not touched upon. The Labor-Greens legacy in that regard was when they made their deal in around about 2010 or 2011 - two out of three Tasmanian forest workers lost their jobs on the back of a sleazy deal to allow Labor to govern. Willing to throw regional jobs - I still recall the devastation in Triabunna, in Geeveston, and so you can go round the regional communities. What has restored some life and vim and vigour back into those communities is that sector, which the Leader of the Opposition could not bring himself to mention, namely the salmon farming sector, which has provided those regional jobs. Instead, he referred to some smelter issues that are not only in Tasmania, but in fact Australia-wide. 

GFG was mentioned. The Premier and I met with Mr Gupta earlier this week. Earlier this morning I shared a cup of coffee with Todd, Matt and Callen from Nyrstar, where they provided me with a full and detailed briefing. The Premier and I will be having a further briefing with the international person in charge - Yuri, I think it is - on Tuesday.

We will see what we can do, but like the Leader of the Opposition - and I agree with him on this - the federal government has a vital role to play. I have been on the blower to minister Ayres as well to discuss these matters, hoping that, especially in relation to Nyrstar, we might be able to get a tripartite agreement with Tasmania, South Australia, and Canberra. I look forward to state Labor working with us to try to convince federal Labor that they have a very real obligation.

In relation to the power prices that the Leader of the Opposition mentioned, on the one hand he says, 'Reduce power prices, make it easier for these companies' and on the other hand, he says that if he had the levers of government, he would be dragging more money out of them. How does that work, if you give subsidies to big companies - and I am not against that in principle, case by case - but then on the other hand, you cannot say you are going to leverage more money out of them. There is an inconsistency which is all based on opportunism rather than genuine concern for our regional workers.

Time expired.

[11.27 a.m.]
Ms ROSOL - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak on this matter of public importance: regional jobs. I think it is easy for us to focus on cities because it is where the majority of people live and it is where we spend a lot of our time, but there are many marvellous things that happen in our regions and there are people who are worthy of our attention and of our time and our consideration. Thank you for this MPI giving us an opportunity to talk about that. Often in our regional areas there are people who are experiencing disadvantage sometimes due to distance, but often due to living in socio-economic circumstances that are different and often they have access to less resources than we have in the cities. 

I want to highlight a couple of things in this session. We have talked  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=28.6_D=3.4_C=0.78] in this MPI already about the situation at Liberty Bell Bay [Bookmark: Phr3_O=32.5_D=28.9_C=0.86]  and the importance of Liberty Bell Bay for the regional jobs in Bass. I want to highlight that on 6 March I wrote on behalf of the Greens to the Premier and asked him what he was doing, if he was aware of the situation at Liberty Bell Bay, and what action he had taken to speak up for the people of Bass and to find out what was happening and what the risks were to the Liberty Bell Bay. I have not received an answer to that letter still [Bookmark: Phr4_O=61.7_D=16.6_C=0.84] . It calls into question for us as the Greens what commitment the Premier and this government have to people living in Bass and to the jobs in that region. I know that the Premier has now shared the information about what he has done on this situation and the action that he is taking, but  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=78.5_D=29.9_C=0.89] to have an outstanding letter from 6 March is very disappointing. 

The other thing that I would like to speak about in relation to regional jobs is the biggest assets that we have in Tasmania, which are our incredible wilderness areas. We have some amazingly beautiful places, which are world-renowned and people come from all over Australia, they come from all over the world, to see our beautiful places in Tasmania.  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=108.7_D=29.6_C=0.90] They are a source of jobs within our state. 

Tourism relies on our beautiful wilderness places and protecting them, However, instead of protecting those places, valuing them and talking them up and really putting in the work to make sure our beautiful wilderness places are healthy and worthy of travelling from other parts of the world to visit, this government is set on destroying those places. 

They have  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=138.6_D=29.9_C=0.83] said that they are going to wind back the protections that were in place on forests in various areas around the state, including quite a number of coops in Bass where I live. They are going to wind back the protections, chop those forests down, and leave areas a wasteland. We know that people come to see our forests. We know that people in communities like Lilydale and Golconda and areas around there, rely on the health of those forests, not only for their own health but to draw people to that region.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=168.7_D=4.1_C=0.65]  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=173.5_D=16.6_C=0.90] If we are going to talk about regional jobs, then we need to talk about taking seriously our responsibility to care for our state, to look after the precious resources that we have in the wilderness and the environment, and to make sure that we are not destroying them. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=190.2_D=29.9_C=0.83]  They have a value and worth of their own and should be protected, but also we need them as a state and certainly our regional areas need them. 

I highlight a brilliant example of something that happened in the state and a regional area, which was Derby. Derby was a part of Tasmania that was struggling. It was a community that was not doing well. A lot of people like to say we cannot turn things around and create jobs in regional areas; that we cannot transform our regional communities. However, in Derby we have an example  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=221.2_D=2.6_C=0.94] where that did happen, where people had a vision for tourism to bring tourists into the area and now we have a thriving community there, a busy place. It is an example of what can be done when we value tourism and when we value places and think of them differently. 

The Greens encourage the government to get out of their little boxes of how they think about regional  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=254.8_D=4.7_C=0.89] jobs and think of the big picture and do more to be supporting our regional areas.

[11.31 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=262.0_D=29.9_C=0.69] Ms DOW (Braddon - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise and speak on this matter of public importance this morning. I note that Tasmania's economy and really our labour market has been born on the back of traditional industries in this state. Access to cheap power, which of course led to high levels of industrialisation across the state and a lot of downstream processing opportunities for our natural  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=292.2_D=12.7_C=0.71] resources. This has been a wonderful thing for Tasmania's economy and for Tasmanians more generally to draw their livelihood from and provide for their families. 

I take offence to the previous speaker and the minister who said that Tasmanian Labor does not support the salmon industry. I am from the north-west coast, I absolutely support the salmon industry and the 5,000 workers that it employs across our state. Our Leader, Dean Winter, is from the west coast, despite what that side might say. He was born on the west coast and was there on his first day as Labor Leader supporting local salmon workers. 

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=26.4_C=0.77] One thing I would agree with the minister on is that there have been changes in our regional economy over time. We have seen structural change. What that means is that we need a diverse economy. One of those key pillars of a diverse economy in Tasmania is also the tourism industry, and the mining industry, which I did not hear the honourable minister speak about. Maybe he does not support the mining industry or care about the mining industry in Tasmania. I can rest assured  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=57.9_D=2.6_C=0.66] to the House that we do on this side, absolutely [Bookmark: Phr4_O=63.8_D=0.7_C=0.68]  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=65.1_D=29.8_C=0.83] , and forestry as well.

I come from a forestry background. That was what brought the livelihood and food to my family for many generations and downstream processing in the forest industry. I certainly do understand and value that industry as well, minister, just in case you were wondering but to get to the point that you made in the first part of your contribution about the Spirits of Tasmania, Tasmanians do not trust your government to manage this project, minister. You have made an absolute mess of it. We are able to come in here and ask questions  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=95.2_D=27.2_C=0.76] and to scrutinise you and will continue to do that on that project. You did not know the answer to that question about that shutdown yesterday. It did actually happen. The problem that you have is that you have not been across the details from day one as a government, nor done the due diligence. Berth 3 is a great example of that. If you do not know, I would suggest that perhaps you would look to find more information about this important project. 

One of the things that we would love to know on this side of the House is when will the ships actually be here?  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=123.0_D=3.6_C=0.60] We have a situation now where we are going to get a berth finally built but  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=127.0_D=29.8_C=0.70] we will not have any ships to berth in it. If you could clarify that, that would be fantastic, minister.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Ms Dow, if you could direct your comments through the Chair to stop the interjections, that would be lovely.

Ms DOW - Thanks, Deputy Speaker, I do not do that well, I will acknowledge that. I want to bring the House back to the tourism industry and obviously the important role that that plays across our state as part of a diverse economy for Tasmania. It is a new part of our economy, an emerging part of our economy, that has in fact assisted in creating employment opportunities in regional  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=157.1_D=25.5_C=0.79] Tasmania but I have concerns about this government's commitments and promises that they have made over time when it comes to infrastructure projects around the tourism industry. 

One of those is the Edge of the World project down at the beautiful Arthur River. Back in 2021, this government promised $2.75 million for the redevelopment of that area, putting in new car parking, new non-obstructive shelter and interpretive materials. These are  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=183.4_D=2.8_C=0.89] all things that would really enhance that asset  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=186.6_D=15.2_C=0.85] and bring more people to that region. Not only that, from a local perspective, for the local economy, it would mean that local people had jobs constructing those things as well. That would be a good thing for civil construction companies in the Circular Head region and for construction companies in the Circular Head region.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=202.1_D=25.0_C=0.81] I want to put on the record that I hope that that money will still be in the Budget when it is handed down later this afternoon, and in fact that project will be delivered. 

The other project that I want to talk about is the Next Iconic Walk, which was announced way back in 2018. It is another great example of another new tourism offering to generate economic activity, this time on the west coast,  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=227.7_D=3.8_C=0.63] where we have seen downturns in mining and changes in mining.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=231.8_D=28.0_C=0.81] We have obviously seen the introduction of fish farming, which has led to great investment and economic opportunity across the west coast. It is a highly valued industry, particularly for the people of Strahan and the surrounds, but also all those who are employed in the ancillary jobs and jobs that flow on across the local economy to that industry. I would like to understand what the government's plan is regarding that project as well. This is a government that makes promises  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=260.3_D=1.0_C=0.65] for infrastructure projects,  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=261.6_D=3.0_C=0.78] pushes them out in the forward Estimates and never delivers them.

[11.36 a.m.]
Mr SHELTON (Lyons) - Deputy Speaker, it gives me pleasure to rise this morning to speak on this MPI issue of regional jobs. I am a Lyons member and there is nothing more regional in Tasmania than Lyons but it has been initiated by the comments and the issues at Liberty Bell Bay and through the  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=297.1_D=7.9_C=0.55] GFG group. Over my lifetime I recognise that company as TEMCO. There was TEMCO, Comalco, and they have been fantastic drivers of our economy. They have been fantastic employers over time. What we all have to relate to in this House is that before you have an employee, you actually have to have an employer. You need somebody who is willing to invest in your region, in a particular company, to employ people. 

TEMCO has had somewhat of a chequered lifetime. I welcome the approach by the government, the minister and the Premier in addressing some of the issues with the company. Hopefully, we can come to a resolution that suits everybody down there, because I have mates who have worked at TEMCO and now Liberty Bell Bay. I have one who still works there, and he has been there for a significant number of years. It is important to him, to his family and to the community he works in that we are able to find a solution around this. 

When we start talking about rural and regional jobs, you have to look at the whole of Tasmania. You cannot go past the fact that the government's 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future is investing in the future workforce by improving job prospects for Tasmanians. Our government's employment and sustainable record has been at a high level. Employment has been at a high level over the last three years. In March this year, the unemployment rate was at 3.8 per cent, a record low. That is across the state. You cannot ignore the fact that that is a very good figure. 

Now, it has got to the point, in some regional communities, where jobs are looking for somebody to go into them. There are adverts on the front door of businesses saying, 'We need help.' We all know that when you get down to about 3.8 per cent unemployment, there is very limited market in there. That is a fantastic achievement by this government. Tasmania has a record low unemployment rate - the average is 4.2 per cent over the last three years. We cannot ignore the fact that that is a good result.

In April 2025 there were 281,927 Tasmanians in work, including 136,236 women, which is 48 per cent of the workforce, which is a fantastic result. Some people would like to see another couple of percent on that to get the 50/50, but I know that a lot of women out there and ladies are at home looking after their families. Yes, the objective is 50 per cent, but 48.3 per cent is a pretty good effort. Over 47,000 jobs have been created since March 2014 when we were elected. Yes, people can criticise when one person is out of work or whatever, but the overall employment rate is fantastic. Youth unemployment is down to 10 per cent and it was 16.6 per cent in 2014. Another fantastic result. 

You cannot go past - and it is a Labor and Liberal side of things - when we start talking about water investment in regional communities. Of course, part of the Meander Dam process - there was a Labor government then; this government has invested more and more, with the help of the federal government, into water infrastructure. That has allowed us to grow our agricultural industry, and it continues to grow.

The Greens said, or Mr Kim Booth said, that there will not be a single spud grown out of Meander Dam water. I would love to take him to Simplot's Shed, which is full of thousands and thousands of potatoes.

[11.41.a.m.]
Mr FARRELL (Derwent) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise to speak on this matter of public importance - regional economy and jobs. As a fellow member for Lyons. I would echo the sentiment that Lyons is definitely the most regional electorate that we have in this state, and I am happy to argue that with anyone at any point in time. 

The regional economy and regional jobs across Lyons is something that is of great importance to me. Something that I have campaigned on and talked about is current and future opportunities for people in Lyons. In particular there are amazing opportunities across tourism, digital economy and remote work. Huge increases are going to happen across the entire electorate and there are huge opportunities for the people who live there.

One great example in digital economy in particular - shout out to Hand Built Creative who started probably about 15 years ago out of Richmond, and are now world leaders in augmented reality and extended reality technology. These are the type of real startups out in the community, out in Tasmania, having huge success on the world stage, that the government should really be supporting. Those kinds of startups are creating new jobs and they are creating them in regional Tasmania. Why would they not? It is the best place in the world to live. It is the best place in the world to raise your family. Having those opportunities is absolutely essential.

Clearly, I want the opportunities for the youth, but also for everyone to be encouraged and comfortable to live and work in regional Tasmania, even if that is not in Lyons - anywhere across regional Tasmania. Some of the really big stumbling blocks for that, which I hear about from people all the time, are about access to quality education, reliable health care and reliable public transport. 

I think it goes without saying that this government has really given up on regional Tasmania in terms of providing those quality services. Their focus has been elsewhere. Everyone can see where their focus is; what you see in the media indicates what the focus of this government is. The real people of Tasmania, particularly those in regional Tasmania, are the ones who are missing out.

One issue that I brought to the Chamber this morning is about mobile phone and data coverage across regional Tasmania. The minister gave a pathetic answer about what she is looking at doing and what the government is looking at doing in terms of fixing those problems. Instead, she seemed to try to handball this issue to anywhere that she could - to the Telcos, to the federal government. Interestingly, she then admitted that in 20 years in the private sector, she had also been working on this issue. Perhaps the minister has not given up on regional Tasmania. Perhaps the minister never cared about regional Tasmania at all.

All the minister says she can do is write some letters to beg for someone else to do her job for her. She encouraged me to do the same, to talk to my federal colleagues and to get some movement on this issue. Of course I will. I will stand up for regional Tasmania and I will stand up for enabling technology that will provide the opportunities for the economy and for jobs in the future. When that is done, the minister's credit will be reduced to a comment on Facebook, 'and me too'. That was for you, Mr Winter. 

Mobile phone and data services are very important in regional Tasmania, because there is ongoing digitisation of government and public services. There are lots of smaller businesses, lots of self-employment and lots of remote work. I would say that regional Tasmania is probably more reliant on mobile phone and data services than the cities, relying on access to the internet for their work. Small populations means that all of those businesses are doing a lot of travel, and the reality in regional Tasmania is that they are on the road, their calls are dropping out and they do not have access to the service they need. On the east coast and the Great Eastern Drive, it is patchy between Sorell and Buckland, Buckland and Orford, through Rocky Hills, Cranbrook to Bicheno; Chain of Lagoons and Four Mile Creek has almost no coverage at all. Beaumaris to St Helens also, dropping out all the time. There are continual promises and ideas but no real action, only temporary patching for the tourist season. What regional Tasmanians deserve are long-term, reliable solutions for their residents to have access to this technology.

There is plenty the state government can do, and a shout out to the Northern Midland Business Alliance for showing how they can work in partnership with Telstra to actually get activity on this matter. The minister for writing letters to the federal government, Ms Ogilvie, has given up on regional Tasmania. The minority Liberal government has given up on regional Tasmania. I say to you, we will keep fighting for regional jobs and the regional economy. We will never give up.

Second Reading

[3.04 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Treasurer) - Thank you very much, Honourable Speaker. Today, I have the pleasure of delivering the second budget of this re-elected Rockliff Liberal government. A budget that delivers what we said we would do. A budget that continues to deliver our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future. A budget that backs business, creates jobs, supports families, and builds stronger and safer communities. This Budget invests in things that matter to Tasmanians: cost of living, health, education, public safety, and housing. A budget that gets the balance right. This Budget delivers a sensible pathway to surplus without increasing taxes. This Budget builds a better Tasmania, now and for the future.

Tasmania's economy is strong and growing. It is now worth more than $40.6 billion. Gross State Product has increased by $8.9 billion since we came to government, which is a 26 per cent increase. We have the strongest wage growth in the country and the highest level of business confidence. Never in Tasmania's history has the unemployment rate been so low. We know that a strong economy is necessary for investment in essential services. In other words, to ensure the government can support and care for Tasmanians, we need to build and grow a strong economy. Our plan is to make Tasmania the best place to live, work, raise a family, invest and do business.

We understand that family budgets continue to be stretched. High interest rates and inflation have made it harder for families to make ends meet. This Budget recognises that challenge and continues to deliver record cost-of-living support to help ease that burden. Our Renewable Energy Dividend will continue our commitment to help Tasmanians with their power bills. This year, every Tasmanian household will receive a $60 credit on their power bill. This Budget continues half-price bus fares for Tasmanian school children and for regional routes. This is an important cost-of-living saving that will make life a little easier for thousands of Tasmanians. The Budget provides record concessions to assist those most in need. We are also investing $6.7 million for the delivery of food-relief programs. 

Building a better health system has been a cornerstone of our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future. This government has a proud record of delivering health services. Over the last 11 years, we have invested more than $1 billion in new hospitals and health infrastructure, and we will spend a billion dollars more over the next decade to keep building a better health system for all Tasmanians.

This Budget provides an extra $942 million to meet increased demand for health and mental health services. That is almost $10 million every single day into our health system. This is a massive investment, but it is absolutely the right thing to do. We will continue to be there for Tasmanians at their time of greatest need because that is what Tasmanians deserve. This Budget provides more than $70 million over the next four years to keep delivering record elective surgeries for Tasmanians. This Budget also delivers more health services to Tasmanian women, including $7.5 million for additional diagnostic breast imaging clinics to provide statewide public diagnostic mammography services.

To help relieve pressure on GPs and hospitals, expanded access to health care from pharmacies will be boosted - $5 million is being invested to further expand the role of pharmacists to include treatment of conditions such as ear infections, reflux, skin conditions such as shingles and eczema, and wound care.

Helping Tasmanians own a home has been a key focus of this government. This government has been tackling the housing challenges with a bold suite of planning reforms designed to increase supply and help meet demand. The Budget invests nearly half a billion dollars over the next four years in Homes Tasmania to help more Tasmanians access a home.

We are continuing to stamp out stamp duty for first home buyers of existing homes up to $750,000, saving Tasmanians up to $28,000. We are continuing the MyHome shared equity program allowing eligible Tasmanians to purchase a home with as little as 2 per cent deposit.

This Budget also assists at-risk women and children, providing $2.4 million to support those facing homelessness with services at the former Bethlehem House site.

This government is committed to community safety. We are providing record investment to keep our streets safe. We are investing in a record number of police. This Budget invests more than $3.7 million in protective equipment, including handheld metal detector wands, the trial of tasers for our officers on the beat, and additional body-worn cameras. We are also investing heavily into programs that aim to break cycles of offending and providing the support that is needed to enable offenders to rehabilitate.

The government recognises that education is a powerful driver for improving economic and social outcomes in Tasmania. This Budget reflects a record investment in education of over $2 billion next year alone. This government has signed a historic funding agreement that will see our schools supported more than ever before. Our 192 schools and just over 53,000 students from prep to year 12 are already benefiting from this investment through actions including super-charging our successful Lifting Literacy initiative. This additional funding will help drive our ambition for full literacy attainment, giving young Tasmanians a solid foundation for future learning and career choice.

With $297 million invested in education facilities over the next four years, students and staff from 25 schools across Tasmania will benefit from building works. This Budget provides an additional $10 million to support the delivery of education to the growing number of students with disability in Tasmanian government schools, with over 8600 students with a disability being supported.

This Budget also includes $5.6 million, on top of our overall commitment of $32 million, to build four new super-sized child and Family Learning Centres in Huonville, Longford, Smithton and Scottsdale.

To provide services to Tasmanians, we must continue to have a strong economy. This government is continuing to ensure the key drivers of Tasmania's economic strength receive the support needed to flourish. This Budget supports Tasmania's productive industries. From agriculture to aquaculture, fishing and forestry, manufacturing and mining, we are backing the industries that feed our families, support our exports and provide thousands of local jobs. We will continue to advocate for these industries in Canberra and at an international level.

This government has led the nation when it comes to sustainable irrigation. Water is?

Government members - Liquid gold.

Mr Winter - We are not serious, are we?

Members interjecting.

Mr BARNETT - Liquid gold, and our Schemes are economic and social drivers. They enhance and grow our regions. This Budget includes $63.7 million of our $75 million commitment to the $300 million Greater South East Irrigation Scheme. The scheme will provide a highly reliable supply of irrigation water to what is one of the driest areas in the state. It will drive millions of dollars of new on-farm investment and create valuable jobs during and after construction.

This Budget also provides $1.5 million to continue funding the vital Agriculture Research and Development Fund to support world-class research, development and extension to deliver practical, on-farm benefits to our state's agri-food producers.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=13.3_D=30.0_C=0.83] The Budget also continues to support Tasmania's renewable energy future. We are continuing to invest in Tasmania's future as a renewable energy powerhouse, with $64.8 million over the forward Estimates to progress strategic renewable energy projects. We are bringing on new generation and delivering our Tasmanian renewable energy target with our $14.4 million Renewable Energy Approvals Pathway and progressing our clean fuels agenda.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=44.7_D=23.3_C=0.81] We are continuing to back Marinus Link, an intergenerational project that has the potential to unlock substantial new investment in renewable energy generation, improve energy security and grow the economy for decades. We are demonstrating our commitment to progressing Project Marinus by provisioning $300 million in equity.  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=69.1_D=3.6_C=0.70] Our commitment to Marinus Link, however, is not at any cost. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=73.5_D=9.2_C=0.84]  It is contingent on what is in the best interest of Tasmania and a positive financial investment decision by all three governments by August this year.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=84.0_D=29.3_C=0.87] This government is building a better Tasmania now and for the future. This weekend, all Tasmanians can be rightly proud with the opening of our largest transport infrastructure ever, the Bridgewater Bridge. This is intergenerational infrastructure, and this Budget will continue to invest heavily in road infrastructure with $1.6 billion across the Budget and forward Estimates. This includes the start of the major  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=113.5_D=30.0_C=0.73] multi-year program of improvements to the Arthur Highway; ongoing major investment in the Bass Highway along with the East and West Tamar Highways; investment of $419.7 million over four years on maintenance, continuing our important blitz on potholes; the final stages of completion of the 10-year Midland Highway Action Plan; and further investment in the South East Traffic Solution, including duplication of the Midway Point and  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=143.6_D=7.4_C=0.65] Sorell causeways, and the Tasman Highway between the Hobart Airport interchange and the Midway Point causeway.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=151.9_D=25.7_C=0.82] Our focus is not just on roads. The Budget also invests $95.7 million in Tasmania's freight rail network in 2025-26 as part of the $243.7 million commitment over the next four years. 

This government knows the state's 42,000 small businesses are the engine room of our economy and support our rural and regional communities. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=178.2_D=2.7_C=0.77]  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=181.9_D=27.9_C=0.85]  We value small business, and we value the more than 100,000 Tasmanians employed by small businesses. 

In conjunction with the Small Business Council of Tasmania and the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, our government is delivering our Small Business Growth Strategy 2026. This year's Budget features over $2.5 million to support small businesses, including $500,000 to establish a Small Business Start-Up Permit process. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=210.6_D=4.4_C=0.72]  The new startup permit will enable small businesses to trial their concept for 12 months  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=215.3_D=26.5_C=0.81] with a single permit and will make Tasmania the startup capital of Australia. This government will always put small business in front and centre of our policy agenda. 

Recent data shows that tourism growth is outpacing the state average in jobs and contribution to Gross State Product. Now, one in six jobs are in tourism and hospitality in the state. We know we are in a globally competitive environment  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=245.8_D=17.7_C=0.91] to attract visitors. Tourism is crucial to our economy and way of life. The Budget contains an additional $38 million investment to maintain tourism marketing funding over the next 4 years. Our funding commitment will also support research into emerging consumer markets.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=264.6_D=24.9_C=0.77] Tasmania's natural landscapes are world-class destinations, attracting millions of locals and visitors every year to explore incredibly diverse coastlines, recreational and wilderness areas, and unique wildlife. That is why we are continuing to invest over $441 million in our parks to deliver significant economic, social and cultural benefits for our state.

We will continue to deliver the $2 million online booking system  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=295.1_D=9.9_C=0.74] to enable locals and visitors to Tasmania to pre-book campsites, walking experiences, cave tours and park passes. Our new commitment of over $33 million to maintain and upgrade visitor experiences and amenities across our much-loved destinations underpin what Tasmanians love about our state. This investment also supports regional employment with over 380 nature-based tourism operators in our state to benefit from these improvements.

We will continue to deliver the $40 million Next Iconic Walk in the spectacular Tyndall Range and secure our reputation as one of the greatest walking destinations in Australia, if not the world. This is in addition to our support for mountain biking experiences, which are attracting international events. These investments back our growing visitor economy, create jobs and support Tasmanian contractors and suppliers.

The Budget backs in sports and events. It commits $414 million for sporting infrastructure and community sports over the forward Estimates. That includes facilities like the Northern Suburbs Recreational Hub, the Glenorchy Sports Centre, the JackJumpers High Performance Centre, and the AFL High Performance Centre in Kingborough, as well as vital upgrades to the Silverdome, investment into the new Devonport Stadium, and improvements at Dial Park. These state-of-the-art facilities will provide endless opportunities for the next generation of Tasmanian champions and promote healthier lifestyles.

Events are a core driver of our visitor economy, and we are continuing to support an ongoing and lively event scene in Tasmania with $62 million to attract and support events. This includes iconic events like Dark Mofo and the Taste of Summer as well as new, innovative offseason and shoulder-season events throughout the regions.

Tasmanians deserve to be supported to achieve at the highest levels in sport, which is why we are investing $1.5 million in our Tasmanian Institute of Sport Talent ID program ahead of the Brisbane Olympics. We are also investing $11.6 million into major partnerships with the Tasmanian JackJumpers, Hawthorn Football Club and Cricket Tasmania.

This Budget includes provision for our investment in the Macquarie Point Precinct, an industrial area that has been underutilised for decades, a precinct that has the potential to revitalise the Hobart waterfront. We are not just building a home for our very own AFL and AFLW teams, we are investing in a precinct and the future of our state, investing in our next generation. This project will supercharge the state's economy, create new jobs, be a catalyst for further investment and new opportunities: a state-of-the-art stadium and precinct that will generate employment, drive tourism and boost local businesses.

The development of the Macquarie Point precinct will bring year-round activity that will lift the entire state - concerts, major events, national and international sporting fixtures, and conferences - delivering a steady stream of visitors and spending to our economy.

This Budget also provides ongoing funding to support Closing the Gap programs, including support for the Palawa Business Hub. We know we need to do more to reduce and eliminate economic and social disparity. The Budget funds new appointments, working in partnership with the Tasmanian Aboriginal community and people, to promote our agenda for improvement.

Framing a budget is never an easy task. I have approached this task carefully, with the needs of all Tasmanians in mind and the principles outlined in the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act 2007. Firstly, Responsibility and Sustainability. Responsibility to manage the state's finances for the wellbeing of all Tasmanians and to ensure the state's economy remains strong. To invest for the now and provide for the next generation of Tasmanians. The state's fiscal strategy will be reviewed in 2026-2027 to ensure it is robust, sustainable and meets the needs of Tasmanians.

Secondly, compassion for those who need our help. In times of national and global uncertainty, in times of high inflation and interest rates, we must prepare for such unexpected events and ensure that we can weather any economic headwinds that may arise. This government will step up. That is what Tasmanians deserve.

Thirdly, accountability. I am a strong supporter of giving all members of parliament the resources and support they need to effectively and efficiently participate in the budget process. I acknowledge the recommendation in the Eslake Review about the establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Office and the views of members in this place. We must all be responsible with the expenditure of government money. That is why the Budget sets aside funds to explore the best way to provide such a resource to the parliament. We will examine what existing assets we can coordinate and utilise for what we consider a very worthy objective.

As a state, we have faced challenges and taken them head-on. We invested heavily in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic to save lives and livelihoods. That came at a significant cost, estimated at over $2 billion. That expenditure is still being felt and will continue to wash through the budget for some years to come.

We continue to invest heavily to implement the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into the Tasmanian Government's Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings.

Despite the challenges, Tasmania's economy is strong and growing. The level of debt is manageable and is necessary to ensure we continue to back business and industry, support jobs and grow the economy. We remain on track to deliver a net operating surplus by 2029-30. It is a sensible pathway to surplus.

We want to do even better. We want to return to a net operating surplus earlier than that. That is why this government has presented an ambitious reform agenda which is reflected in this Budget. It contains three important initiatives.

Firstly, it recognises a strong economy is central to everything we can deliver as a government. It recognises the most valuable way to support a strong and growing economy is to back business, and that is exactly what we are doing. This year we have rolled out planning reforms to make Tasmania's planning approvals easier, faster and cheaper. We have stepped up our war on red tape, supercharging our ongoing efforts to support small business and streamline the processes our businesses must navigate.

Secondly, we are working with the public service to systematically review all government programs and determine what is no longer a priority, what can be done better and more effectively and productively. The Efficiency and Productivity Unit will assist government agencies to identify areas for improvement and ensure that we have a public service that is the right size, the right shape, in the right place, and equipped with the right tools and resources to deliver for Tasmanians. We are ensuring we spend every single dollar of taxpayers' money wisely, just as Tasmanians expect.

Thirdly, we are also undertaking the biggest reform of government-owned businesses in decades. It is a Team Tasmania approach. This will ensure that government businesses engage with business and community to deliver services to Tasmanians at the lowest sustainable cost, while also growing our economy. It will also consider which businesses may best serve Tasmanians outside of government ownership.

Over recent weeks work has been progressing with the assistance of Mr Eslake. I can update the House today that the following businesses have been assessed and determined as best remaining in government ownership, albeit with strong governance arrangements. They are: the Port Arthur Historic Site Management Authority, TASCORP, Tasracing, TasRail, Entura, and the Public Trustee. 

Further, following the receipt of an independent assessment, the government has determined not to pursue a merger of TasRail, TT-Line and TasPorts.

In light of that decision and observations contained in the independent assessment, the government has also ruled out divestment of TT-Line. 

As we have previously stated, Hydro Tasmania will not be divested. 

The remaining government businesses will continue to be thoroughly assessed.

This is a government committed to Tasmania's long-term future. We must ensure that all government businesses are utilised in the best interests of all Tasmanians. Efficiently allocating public resources for community benefit is what responsible governments do. This parliament will have decisions to make in coming months that will be vital for Tasmania for years to come. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.4_D=8.2_C=0.87] 

Divestment of some government businesses and surplus Crown land will provide growth opportunities for private investment and enable the government to invest more  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=34.1_D=7.6_C=0.69] in essential services for Tasmanians. It would also mean the state returns to surplus sooner and pays down debt.  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=43.0_D=2.6_C=0.92] That will be a decision of parliament.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=46.9_D=19.6_C=0.82] I thank the Premier, the Honourable Jeremy Rockliff, for his strong leadership of our Liberal government. I also acknowledge that we are a minority government, and I look forward to continued goodwill and collaboration with all members  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=67.3_D=28.8_C=0.82] so we can make a positive difference.

This Budget will continue to deliver our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future. It is a plan that will continue to grow a strong economy; a plan that gets the balance right with necessary investment into the services Tasmanians need now, and without new or increased taxes; a plan that provides a clear and sensible pathway to surplus.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=97.1_D=10.3_C=0.86] Honourable Speaker, in conclusion, it is a plan that is building a better Tasmania now and for the future. I commend the bill to the House.

Members - Hear, hear.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=117.0_D=4.0_C=0.89] The SPEAKER - I invite our guests from the other place to return to their home.

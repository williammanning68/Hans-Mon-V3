 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=220.2_D=6.7_C=0.84] Thursday 10 April 2025

The Speaker, Ms O'Byrne, took the Chair at 10.00 a.m., acknowledged the Traditional People, and read Prayers.


QUESTIONS

Energy - Transmission Costs for Major Industrials

Mr WINTER question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

[10.01 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=251.9_D=28.4_C=0.80] On 2 April, you issued a press release which stated:

Our major industrials have faced nowhere near a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs.

Last week you were asked whether you stood by your statement on 2 April. You told this House:

The assertion that our major industrials have faced a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs is categorically incorrect.

You further said that:

The assertion that our major industrials faced a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs is categorically wrong and incorrect [Bookmark: Phr12_O=280.5_D=14.0_C=0.83] . 

Later you said that you rejected the assertion.

This morning the CEO of the Tasmanian Minerals Manufacturing and Energy Council, which represents some of our major industrials, has confirmed that transmission costs have increased by as much as 2 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=295.2_D=3.8_C=0.81] 0 per cent. You said major industrials have faced nowhere near a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs. Have you misled Tasmanians?

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=21.4_D=10.1_C=0.85] Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. Let me first begin by saying that the government understands that our major industrial [Bookmark: Phr3_O=32.8_D=15.3_C=0.81] s are a critical part of Tasmania's economy. They employ hundreds of people right across our state and are a key driver for our broader economy.

Mr Winter - Thousands, actually. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr DUIGAN - As a government we have always backed our industries, including our major industrials (MI), and will continue to do so. As members would be aware and others more broadly across the state, there are currently significant headwinds facing MIs, and they are global pressures which are having impacts in Tasmania. That is why [Bookmark: Phr5_O=76.2_D=6.5_C=0.87]  the Premier has written to the federal Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister [Bookmark: Phr6_O=83.6_D=28.8_C=0.81]  to call on them to support these important industries, not just for Tasmania, but for the nation. 

Energy, including transmission, is one aspect -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr DUIGAN - in which the government can and does support our MIs. Our energy businesses have a long history of supporting Tasmania's economic growth and our interests and our industries, particularly around wholesale energy. I would point to -

Mr WINTER - Point of order, honourable Speaker, the question is about transmission prices and the inaccurate statements the minister made. Could he please address the question that was asked?

The SPEAKER - I take questions about Standing Order 2 seriously. I draw the minister to the question.

Mr DUIGAN -  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=126.8_D=2.2_C=0.95]  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=131.4_D=29.5_C=0.80] Mr Winter's assertion that our major industrials faced a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs is incorrect and I absolutely stand by that statement. Overall transmission costs in Tasmania in the past 10 years in real terms have gone down -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr DUIGAN - in a hugely inflationary period of time, not just in Australia, not just in Tasmania, but globally.

Dr Broad - It is about your accuracy.

The SPEAKER - Dr Broad.

Mr DUIGAN -  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=161.6_D=23.5_C=0.82] Transmission prices for our major industrials in the past 10 years have gone down in real terms and they have gone down 3.3 per cent. 

Ms Finlay - The question is about current transmission costs.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass.

Mr DUIGAN - It is a very important -

Mr Willie - You know you have to be honest. Ministerial code.

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark.

Mr DUIGAN - thing to recognise. There are a range of [Bookmark: Phr11_O=186.2_D=8.6_C=0.78]  year-on-year fluctuations -

Ms Finlay - Do you know that the transmission prices have gone up?

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass.

Mr DUIGAN - that all businesses face, but I absolutely stand by my statement. What I would say, and in reference to [Bookmark: Phr12_O=195.6_D=29.7_C=0.69]  the Premier and this side of the House, because I know minister Abetz is engaging with our MIs -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary without interjection.

Mr WINTER - In his answer the minister said that transmission prices have not gone up by 20 per cent. Coming from that answer, can the minister then say it was accurate when he said major industrials have faced nowhere near a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs? Was that statement accurate? 

The SPEAKER - I will draw the minister to that as it does form part of the original question and arises from the response. 

As th [Bookmark: Phr13_O=225.6_D=25.3_C=0.68] e minister comes to the lectern, allegations of misleading the House under Standing Order 2 are incredibly serious. I expect all members of the House to take this seriously - in making the allegation and responding to it. 

Mr DUIGAN - I will not be walking into the Leader of the Opposition's 'nowhere near' kind of stuff. 

Mr WINTER - You said it.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr DUIGAN - I know he is [Bookmark: Phr14_O=253.8_D=5.9_C=0.82]  wedded to reckless statements. When I contemplate what the Leader of the Opposition said [Bookmark: Phr15_O=261.1_D=19.3_C=0.65]  around the North West Transmission Developments - potentially a $1.5 billion investment -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order.
Mr DUIGAN - that the Leader of the Opposition said to build now without delay in its entirety -

Mr Winter - No, I never said that.

Mr DUIGAN - without anything to plug into it, and what impact would that have had on transmission costs? 

Ms Finlay - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. It was a very specific follow-up question.

The SPEAKER - I will draw the minister [Bookmark: Phr16_O=281.5_D=6.0_C=0.62]  to the question. If the minister feels he has answered it he can always resume the seat.

Mr DUIGAN -  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=289.3_D=2.2_C=0.80] The Leader of the Opposition has quoted a number. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=293.4_D=5.8_C=0.55]  My assertion is that that number is not correct. 


Energy - Transmission Costs for Major Industrials

Mr WINTER question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

[10.07 a.m.]
This is a very serious matter. I ask the minister for Energy to be honest and accurate with his answer. On 2 April 2025, the minister issued a statement and said:

Our major industrials have faced nowhere near a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs, as claimed by the opposition.

This morning, it is not the Leader of the Opposition that has made that claim, it is the industry itself. Will the minister confirm that he misled in that statement? What is he going do about it?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. Again, a little bit like Groundhog Day, but I reiterate, it has been the one question that you have managed to get up for the week, but -

Mr Winter - Because you will not answer it.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left, and the minister will come to the question.

Mr DUIGAN - I have answered, and I continue to answer, that our major industrials have not faced a 20 per cent increase in transmission prices this year. Importantly, as I will continue to reiterate, over the past 10 years in a very inflationary period of time for all business across a range of their inputs.

Ms Finlay - This is about your honesty, about the current increases to the transmission licence.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass, I do not want to have to kick people out on the last day.

Mr DUIGAN - The transmission cost to those MIs has, in fact, in real terms, gone down. That is a hugely important thing to recognise. We will continue on this side of the House to work with our major industrial businesses to understand the headwinds they are facing globally. We will work with our federal colleagues, both in opposition and in government, as the Premier has done. I believe you have been asked by the MIs to reach out to your federal colleagues. I believe they have actually asked you to do one job, Ms Finlay. Have you done it?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my right. The House will come to order. The minister will address the question or resume his seat and members on both sides will have a level of decorum in this place. Minister, to the question.

Mr DUIGAN - As I say, we will continue to work through the range of issues being faced by our major industrial businesses. As I mentioned, the Premier has written to the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister - 

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. It is a really short and sharp question. There was no preamble. The question was in relation to his statement. I am asking the minister to be relevant to the question that was asked. Is it true? Was the statement he made on 2 April that the MIs have faced nowhere near a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs correct or not?

The SPEAKER - It is not appropriate to restate the question. I will take relevance. Minister, I will draw you to the question and if you feel that you have answered it, you can always resume your seat.

Mr DUIGAN - I feel like I have answered, repeatedly, so I will resume my seat. Thank you.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - With respect to you, of course, honourable Speaker - 

The SPEAKER - Of course.

Mr WINTER - the minister has not answered the question. It is a simple question. Was the statement he made on 2 April saying that major industrials had faced nowhere near a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs accurate or not? If it is not accurate, when will he correct the record?
The SPEAKER - Because it is to do with Standing Order 2 - and everyone, I am sure, is familiar with exactly the Standing Order that I am talking about because you all went and read them last night after I reminded you to - I will draw the minister to the question. Allegations of misleading this place, when they are made, should be made seriously and, when they are responded to, should be responded to equally seriously. I will call the minister to the question. You have one minute for the supplementary question, minister.

Mr DUIGAN - I reiterate that our MIs have not faced a 20 per cent increase in transmission prices, and I would again reiterate that over the past 10 years in real terms - 

Mr Winter - You still will not answer the question.

Mr DUIGAN - No, I have answered your question. In real terms, our transmission prices have gone down and that is in sharp contrast to the reckless statements that you would make about -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr DUIGAN - building things without any thought or consideration about what the flow-on effects of those decisions are and what they would do.

Ms Finlay - This is going nowhere near - is the statement you made correct?

Dr Broad - You are trashing everything. 

The SPEAKER - Dr Broad, member for Bass.

Mr DUIGAN - I would again implore you, Ms Finlay - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I will hear the point of order. 

Ms FINLAY - Standing Order 45 relevance. 

The SPEAKER - Thank you. I will draw the minister to the question. I cannot make him answer it in a particular way. The minister is saying that it is not true, so that is all I have, minister. You have three seconds. Actually, you have no seconds. The minister will resume his seat.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Enabling Legislation

Mr BAYLEY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.13 a.m.]
Your stadium is fully cooked, but half-baked. You are attacking the Tasmanian Planning Commission's damning report using concocted legal advice. Whatever your PR strategy, it will not fix the myriad issues with the stadium: contaminated fill material and groundwater that could risk the health of construction workers, future site users and poison the Derwent River; a design that will create a flood risk; a layout that will be unsafe for stadium goers and inaccessible to ambulances and police in an emergency evacuation. The list goes on.

These are the material risks of this poorly-planned stadium that you and Labor want this parliament to rubber stamp. Given you are set to forge on with fast-track legislation within weeks, can you confirm that your only plan to respond to all the major problems identified with the stadium is to cross your fingers and hope for the best, and to ask for the parliament to do the same?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, the content of the question reveals that The Greens are severely on the back foot when it comes to this matter. It has not been a good week for you lot and your anti-stadium crusaders. That is very clear. You mentioned the TPC report. What has been revealed in recent days is extremely disappointing. The fact is, as minister Abetz said yesterday very clearly, Dr Gruen's report is now tainted, at the very least, and an apprehension of bias.

Dr Woodruff - Dr Gruen did not write the TPC report. Stop smearing people. It has nothing to do with the Tasmanian Planning Commission's report. 

The SPEAKER - Leader of The Greens. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Now we know that TPC's draft report relied heavily on Dr Gruen's opinions. 

Mr Bayley - Not for contaminated issues.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader of the Greens. 

Mr Rockliff - It goes to follow that we cannot have confidence in the Planning Commission's report. We have no confidence in the draft report. 

Dr Woodruff - Smearing a past solicitor-general and past secretary -

The SPEAKER - The Leader of The Greens can make a substantiative allegation if she chooses to in other forms of the House. Interjections will cease.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We will continue to work through the report and whatever public feedback there is on it, as I have said very clearly. We will be extracting what we can to inform good and proper planning decisions. We welcome the submissions on 8 May around the stadium, to make the stadium the best it can possibly be. We can no longer have faith in either Dr Gruen's report or the TPC's issues paper as well. Both are now tainted by an apprehension of bias. That is very clear. 

Dr WOODRUFF - You are so shameful. 

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - That is why you are on the back foot. You are anti-stadium, anti-development, anti-jobs crusaders. It has been a bad week for you, but we will still work through the issues as presented. Even in the member's question about uneven surfaces; it is just a flat gravel pit. We are going to build roads and access points and they will be even. I can guarantee it. We do have some road experts in Tasmania.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question from the Deputy Leader of the Greens. 

Mr BAYLEY - The Premier said that this stadium will be the best it can possibly be. Does that mean we have to settle for a half-baked stadium with all these problems? The best it can possibly be is not the best stadium out.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I am going to ask everyone to be quiet. I did not get a question out of that. I got a comment. Is there a question?

Mr BAYLEY - The Premier said the stadium is going to be the best it can possibly be, which alludes to the fact it will be half-baked. It will not be the best there is. 

The SPEAKER - And the question is?

Mr BAYLEY - The Planning Commission has identified a range of issues -

The SPEAKER - This is new information. I want the question from the original point of order. 

Mr BAYLEY - The Planning Commission has raised a range of issues that the Gruen report does not go to, yet he is hearing the Planning Commission because of the Gruen report. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - No, I am sorry. I do not get a question out of that, I genuinely do not. I am so sorry.

Mr BAYLEY - Does he accept that we are going to have a half-baked -

The SPEAKER - No, I am sorry, no.

Mr BAYLEY - Honourable speaker -

The SPEAKER - No. Everyone can resume their seats and somebody can get me a Panadol. The supplementary questions are really important. I do not disagree that there was somewhere you could have gone with a supplementary question, but I did not get a supplementary question out of that, so I will call on the next question, 
Dr Gruen Report - Credibility

Mr O'BYRNE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.18 a.m.]
The TPC's 'Draft Integrated Assessment Report' on the Macquarie Point Multipurpose Stadium relies heavily on Dr Gruen's report. In fact, you could say many of the TPC's arguments are underpinned by Dr Gruen's assumptions and findings. In my view, the Gruen report has serious flaws in methodology, which undermined a number of its assumptions. In addition, we now know Dr Gruen failed to disclose that he met with anti-stadium campaigners prior to being appointed. His appointment was demanded by the JLN, whose leaders' anti-stadium views are well known. The non-disclosure of these meetings and the nature of Dr Gruen's nomination by the JLN mean the report can no longer be considered independent and unbiased. Public confidence in the integrity of this entire process has been compromised. In light of this, will you now write to the TPC and request that they set the Gruen report aside completely?

Mr Bayley - It is not going to change the flood risk. It is not going to change the contamination issues.

The SPEAKER - The Premier has the call; his should be the only voice I can hear.

ANSWER

Mr ROCKLIFF - Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. Noting minister Abetz's discussion yesterday in the parliament and I note your contribution yesterday as well, this is extremely disappointing, I have to say. I concur with my previous comments. There is a massive credibility issue here, in which I am disappointed because -

Dr Woodruff - Who are you disappointed in? The Planning Commission for doing its job?

The SPEAKER - I am sorry. The Leader of the Greens can have another question or she can raise a point of order. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - I am very disappointed actually. We went into good-faith negotiations with the JLN and appointed Dr Gruen. We now know, given meetings that were not disclosed, that there was a clear apprehension of bias when it comes to this report. The TPC relied on Dr Gruen's report throughout the issues and the issues as presented.

Dr Woodruff - They did not.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We can no longer have faith in either report, which is disappointing because we wanted to work through all the issues.

Dr Woodruff - So pathetic and low.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You oppose the POSS, therefore you oppose the submissions. You oppose the hearings. You did not want all this. If you were objective from the beginning, you might not have egg on your face as you have now. I will take into consideration the last part of this question, and I will take it very seriously.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Referendum

Mr GARLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.21 a.m.]
The proposed Macquarie Point Stadium is deeply unpopular and unwelcome. Long before the 'Draft Integrated Assessment Report' was released by the Tasmanian Planning Commission, polling from EMRS showed 65 per cent of people in the north-west were against it. Your Liberal-Labor lockstep government continues to disregard the will of north-west Tasmanians and the north, where it is even more unpopular. In your rush to sign the AFL deal, you have forgotten to ask your Braddon community and hear what they think. A majority of community members here now believe a new stadium is not needed and York Park is a better option. Will you give Braddon and all Tasmanians a say on this? Instead of bringing forward enabling legislation to bypass the POSS process, will you bring forward legislation to enable a referendum on your multibillion-dollar stadium?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I acknowledge the hard sell that this has been when it comes to wanting to have our own AFL and AFLW teams. It is a hard sell because it has taken 40 years to get the team. That has been a lot of effort, but we have secured it. Along with that, we have secured the opportunity for a new stadia infrastructure. The member can speak of polling and, yes, I acknowledge some of the polling out there in terms of this being a hard sell. I am advised that support for the upgrade of the Adelaide Oval was about 20 per cent. There was a lot more drama and protests and all sorts of things with respect to the multi-hundred-billion dollar Adelaide Oval upgrade. Not too many people are against it now.

Dr Woodruff - That community was sickened by their politicians not listening to them.

The SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Having been there recently, I could not find a single person and nor can anyone else. They pushed through, and that is exactly what I will do, Mr Garland, accepting and respecting your view. We are elected in this place to make decisions and sometimes we just have to make the difficult decisions for the benefit of - 

Dr Woodruff - Big corporations.

The SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Tasmania now and into the future. I will be backing our young kids, our boys and girls who want to play for their own team in their own colours and sing the team song. I will back the many people who will be employed in sports management, marketing, tourism, and hospitality, who will all have an opportunity as a result of this significant investment. I implore the member and others: if we do not build the stadium, there will be no team. I cannot be clearer on that.

As I look around the country, there are new high performance centres and training facilities being built. The Adelaide Crows are an example of that: a $100 billion plus facility. You need to have the right facilities, training centre and stadia infrastructure to attract players and ensure that the stadia infrastructure is modern and conducive to the 21st century.

The answer to your question is no, but the voices of the Tasmanian people will be expressed through the parliament.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.


Energy - Transmission Costs for Major Industrials

Mr WINTER question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

[10.26 a.m.]
The CEO of the Tasmanian Minerals, Manufacturing and Energy Council (TMEC), Ray Mostogl, has today confirmed major industrials have faced transmission price rises of up to 20 per cent, directly contradicting the statements you have made repeatedly over the last week and a half. He said they have experienced the highest price rises they have seen in a decade, and that without intervention one is at risk of closing.

If one major industrial were to close, it would be a disaster for our state and a disaster for jobs. It would be a massive blow to Tasmania's industrial base and it would have the potential to put up power prices for every other Tasmanian business and household. How can we have confidence in you to fix this mess if you keep denying there is even a problem?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, let me say at the outset that I absolutely reject the assertion that I have misled this place. I stand by comments that I have made in this place.

Members interjecting.

Mr DUIGAN - As I have said previously, this side of the house is very well aware of the importance of our major industrial sector. We are deeply engaged with those businesses -

Mr Winter - Why are you doing the exact opposite of what they say? You have not even met with them.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition

Mr DUIGAN - to know and understand the challenges that they face. There are a range of challenges -

Mr Winter - They are in your own electorate.

Mr DUIGAN - challenges that they face, and there are a range of challenges, as you may be aware, Mr Winter. Energy is one of those areas - 

Mr Winter - They just go around you and go to Abetz, do they not?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

Mr DUIGAN - that is important to our major industrials and we continue to engage with our major industrials on that point. I point to as recently as late last year [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.3_D=26.4_C=0.77]  when Liberty Bell Bay struck commercial terms with Hydro Tasmania for a 10-year energy deal. It is important that we ask our government businesses to operate on commercial terms with their counterparties. I also point to more recent times where Hydro Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr4_O=58.1_D=2.2_C=0.52] , and our other energy GBE [Bookmark: Phr5_O=61.4_D=23.0_C=0.81] s, have been working with Nyrstar to help address some of the challenges that business is facing. Again, on this side of the House, and through our energy businesses, we are working with those businesses and we are very open to conversations they want to have with us about challenges they are facing.

Mr WINTER - Point of Order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=85.3_D=13.4_C=0.63]  How can we have confidence in you to fix this problem if he is not even admitting what Ray Mostogl has told the public today? 

The SPEAKER - I cannot force the minister answer in a certain way, but I will ask him to be relevant to that question, please.

Mr DUIGAN -  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=100.4_D=0.6_C=0.94]  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=102.0_D=29.2_C=0.81] As I say, working with our businesses and our wider government partners, as I have, and I note that the Premier has written to the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I also believe the energy businesses have asked state Labor to stand up and do something, not come in here and play a bit of politics -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left and members on my right.

Mr DUIGAN - not go to Bell Bay and have a selfie; to do something [Bookmark: Phr9_O=132.1_D=5.1_C=0.79] ; to do something to reach out to your federal counterparts -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr DUIGAN -  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=138.1_D=22.2_C=0.72]  and stand up for this state, not to come in here -

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired. 

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?  

The SPEAKER - I will hear a supplementary.

Mr WINTER - Can the minister explain to the House who is right? Ray Mostogl representing the major industrials, or Nick Duigan, who has not even met with them? 

The SPEAKER - On a supplementary it does go to the original question so I will ask the minister to address it. We can then move to other questions.

Mr Winter - Do you want me to point them out on a map for you?

The SPEAKER -  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=163.8_D=4.5_C=0.69] Leader of the Opposition, you have a supplementary. Do not push it.

Mr DUIGAN -  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=169.1_D=28.1_C=0.58] In terms of not meeting with them, that is factually incorrect. 

Mr Ellis - Labor's misleading.

Mr DUIGAN - Misleading, indeed.

Mr Winter - You are going to answer now? You did not answer the question last week. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Mr Ellis and the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Clark. This is a serious matter and people want an answer. I would like to hear the minister's answer and I am sure others would to.

Mr DUIGAN -  Absolutely, as I have articulated previously through other examples of our energy businesses working proactively [Bookmark: Phr13_O=197.4_D=20.3_C=0.83]  with our MIs to understand and address some of the issues that we are able to help them with. We are committed to doing that. In terms of transmission prices in Tasmania, I point to the fact that over the past 10 years direct connected transmission prices have gone down [Bookmark: Phr14_O=219.1_D=14.4_C=0.64]  in real terms, Mr Winter. What else can you point to? How about interest rates? How have they gone? 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order. The minister will remember to direct his answers through the Chair.


Energy - Transmission Costs for Major Industrials

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=236.4_D=25.7_C=0.85] Mr WINTER question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

[10.31 a.m.]
Late last year, the CEO of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI) said it would be hard to ever trust this government again. This morning he issued another scathing statement that highlights the potentially disastrous impact of the transmission price increases you claim do not even exist. He said: 

There is a question mark over the viability of many of Tasmania's major industrials due to an increase in transmission costs. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=263.0_D=29.4_C=0.82]  If the Tasmanian government does not step in and act, then the Tasmanian community will pay the price. 

That is what he said. He went on to say -

Our major industrials are the lifeblood of our economy and without them power bills will go up, hundreds of Tasmanians will be without a job, and communities will be put at risk.

Both the TCCI and TMEC are warning of the dire consequences if you do not reverse your policy. How are you going to ensure the future viability of our major industrials if you will not even tell the truth about the problem?

ANSWER

As I have repeatedly said, this side of the House continues to work with our major industrials. I have also said and will continue to say we recognise how important those businesses are to our state. We do what we can, where we can, to support those businesses and the many jobs that they represent in Tasmania. Let me be abundantly clear about that. There is a deep level of engagement at every level of our government, from the Premier, the minister for Industry and me as Minister for Energy and Renewables.

Ms Finlay - How many times have you been to Liberty?

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass.

Mr DUIGAN - Transmission prices are a regulated area set by the AER each year, and I believe that is a prudent place to be. Obviously that has worked well for Tasmania over the previous decade. If we contrast that with the most recent experience of Labor in government, we saw a 65 per cent increase in power prices -

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - You were a great TV fisherman, you know.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader of the Opposition; members for Lyons and Clark; Leader of the Opposition.

Mr DUIGAN - We will continue to lean in and to work with our MIs. We will understand where we are able to help them. As I have repeatedly said, there are examples in the very recent past of where the energy businesses in Tasmania have been flexible and dexterous and have delivered positive outcomes to ease the pressure on the MIs. Those same MIs have asked state Labor to do what it might be able to do to speak to its federal counterparts.

Ms Finlay - That is because they know that you cannot do anything. 

Mr DUIGAN - Have you done that? That is the question for you. Have you done that?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass, I do not want to have to - the House will come to order. The minister will not direct questions to anyone else. He will answer questions, and members on my left will stop interjecting. The member for Bass is warned. Minister, you have the call. Address the question.

Mr DUIGAN - In terms of transmission prices in the state, it has been a very good and stable 10 years, with prices trending downward. I would note there are of course year on year fluctuations, but it is important to note that in the past 10 years, direct connected transmission costs have gone down in real terms by 3.3 per cent.

The SPEAKER - The member's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary first. I am assuming that this is a supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - It is. In his answer, the minister called the price rise this year a 'fluctuation'. Is the minister for Energy saying that a 15 to 20 per cent price rise on transmission is a mere fluctuation?

The SPEAKER - It does arise from the answer that the minister gave. I will call the minister for the supplementary question.

Mr DUIGAN - There are indeed fluctuations. One can only ponder what those fluctuations might look like had Mr Winter had his way with a reckless disastrous policy that he signed his name to.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order.

Mr Winter - They are watching you. Do you know they are watching you this morning? They are all lined up watching you deny the existence of the problem.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition.

Mr DUIGAN - You cannot have it both ways. You cannot have that.
Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr DUIGAN - You cannot say 'Marinus is good money after bad.'

Mr Winter - You voted against it yesterday.

Mr DUIGAN - Good money after bad, is it? Good money after bad, Mr Winter? Build it now in its entirety without any thought or consideration.
Ms FINLAY - Point of order, Standing Order 45, relevance. This is very specific about potential fluctuations -

The SPEAKER - I will ask the member to resume her seat. It is called on relevance. You have taken up seven seconds of his time. Minister, you have three seconds left.

Mr DUIGAN - You cannot have it both ways, Mr Winter. 


Energy - Private Power Connections

Mrs PENTLAND question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

[10.37 a.m.]
Yesterday, I asked you about the saga surrounding private power connections that is holding up critical housing developments, increasing consumer costs and creating safety concerns. You told the House that you have been aware of this issue for a month or two, but in March you told the National Electrical and Communications Association that you raised the issue with TasNetworks last year. Can you explain the discrepancy? This is an 18-month-old issue and it needs urgent attention. Will you now act to bring this costly mess to an end?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, this is an issue that I have been aware of for some time. As I did mention yesterday, it has stemmed from the fact that some councils are not providing the approval for TasNetworks to connect customers' power to cross underneath council land, underneath the footpath or nature strip, and then the subsequent recording of the Before You Dig Australia information.

I am very keen to see this issue resolved. It is not good enough, and I expect TasNetworks will work constructively with councils and other stakeholders to come to a solution that is safe, cost effective and acceptable to customers across Tasmania. TasNetworks will continue to engage in active discussion with local government and the industry to resolve this.

There are current negotiations and consultation with the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) to ensure the proposed solution meets the regulatory requirements. Suffice to say that there is work going on for this, but we will continue to push it forward.

Mr WINTER - Point of order, I seek your guidance, Speaker. The minister is from the other place and he has just effectively acknowledged in his answer that his statement yesterday was incorrect. Is the requirement that he corrects the record in this place or should it be corrected in the record of the other place?

The SPEAKER - Standing Order 2 requires everyone to be honest in their public statements, both within this House and within the other place. Our Standing Orders require that members should correct the record at the earliest possible opportunity. If the minister feels that he is now in a position where he must correct the record, the earliest opportunity is while he is on his feet in this place. His behaviour and actions in the other place are a matter for the other place, but that would be our expectation here.
Youth Justice - Low-Level Offending Punishment

Ms BADGER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.40 a.m.]
Premier, your government's Youth Justice Blueprint and the commission of inquiry recommendations both emphasise the need to increase diversion from the youth justice system, yet under your watch, diversions for youth offenders have decreased from 54 to 36 per cent. Not content with this abysmal record, your government has established Strike Force in the South and Task Force in the North, both targeting youth offenders.

Yesterday, the police proudly issued a media statement outlining the work of Task Force Raven, who arrested a 17-year-old. The statement said the youth will be proceeded against by summons for possessing and consuming liquor in a public place. It is an incredibly heavy-handed approach, especially for an action that I would wager some of this parliament may well have actioned in their youth. Given the critical need to divert youth away from the youth justice system, do you think this low-level offending needs a dedicated, expensive task force response?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, what we all want in youth justice commitment, investment and outcome is for better outcomes for our young people. We want to ensure that our young people, should they come onto the wrong side of the law, are able to be supported to be productive members of our community. That is why we have a minister for Rehabilitation, and why my commitment to reducing recidivism is a very strong commitment. That is why we need a better youth justice system, which I commend minister Jaensch on, that ensures our young people are supported to be productive members of our community. 

I am not aware of the circumstances that you say, but we also need to ensure that our community is safe. Community safety is essential.

Mr Bayley - Consuming alcohol on the street?

Dr Woodruff - This is not what the commission of inquiry recommended we do.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It is about providing balance and ensuring that our community is safe. That is what we will continue to do in supporting our youth in implementing a comprehensive yet therapeutic youth justice system, and also ensuring we have the resources of our police service on the ground to ensure that other law-abiding citizens can go about their day and not only feel safe, but be safe.

Dr Woodruff - But there is meant to be diversion.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.


Dr Gruen Report - Consultation with Stakeholders

Mr JENNER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.44 a.m.]
Yesterday the ABC reported that Dr Gruen met with several opponents of the Macquarie Point stadium whilst undertaking his review. However, it also confirmed that he met with a number of pro-stadium figures including the Tassie Devils Chairman, Grant O'Brien, and the Macquarie Point Development Chair, Anne Beach. Dr Gruen responded to the report by saying it is not only unremarkable for reviewers to consult with stakeholders with diverse views - it is expected.

Will you acknowledge that Dr Gruen is one of the country's most highly regarded economists, and much like those on the TPC panel, his credentials were the reason he was chosen to undertake the report? Is your government deliberately choosing to ignore the fact that Dr Gruen also met with a number of pro-stadium proponents in a malicious attempt to discredit both his report and the TPC's report on the stadium?

Dr Woodruff - Good question. That is exactly right. It is a smear campaign.

The SPEAKER - The only person who has been asked a question is the Premier, so the only person answering it is the Premier. Thank you.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I believe the real issue here is that Dr Gruen met with anti-stadium people before his appointment and, as I understand it, engaged with the pro-stadium people after the appointment was made. That is where the credibility - or lack of - lies. I have been very clear on Dr Gruen's report, which was made public in very early January. I have not attacked Dr Gruen, ever.

Dr Woodruff - You are smearing his reputation, though.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I am just pointing out the facts, actually. I do not need to stand here and diminish Dr Gruen's credibility, because unfortunately the circumstance referred to in the question you have just asked - Dr Gruen meeting with anti-stadium people before the appointment was made - is a credibility problem for Dr Gruen.

Supplementary Question

Mr JENNER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr JENNER - Whether he met with them before or after, I cannot see any difference in sustained outcome. What I am asking is: are you deliberately choosing to ignore the fact that Dr Gruen met with pro-stadium stakeholders as well? I find it quite difficult that you have used parliamentary privilege to ruin someone's career -
The SPEAKER - Member, I ask you to just ask your question. That is a substantive issue that you can raise in other forms of the debate around the processes of where privilege is applied, but I will draw the Premier to the question again. I think he did answer it, but I will ask the Premier to confirm that. Thank you.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the member for the supplementary. The issue is the fact that Dr Gruen did not disclose the meeting. It is a matter of disclosure, or in this case, lack of.


Energy - Transmission Costs for Major Industrials

Mr WINTER question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

[10.47 a.m.]
Transmission prices for our major industrials is an extremely serious issue. This is about businesses that employ thousands of Tasmanians - not hundreds, as you said earlier - underpin the entire Tasmania economy and support a stable Tasmanian energy grid. This is about the fact that three of them are under significant pressure, and the fact that your government is making things worse by jacking up energy transmission costs by as much as 20 per cent. 

Despite the CEO of the Tasmania Minerals Manufacturing and Energy Council confirming these price rises, you have continued to stand by your previous statements where you claim that major industrials have faced nowhere near 20 per cent increases in their transmission costs. This is getting ridiculous, minister. Are you seriously saying that Ray Mostogl, the head of TMEC who represents these major industrials, is wrong and you are right? 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I stand by statements that I have made in this place -

Mr Winter - False ones.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr DUIGAN - and also reiterate the statements that I have made about our side of the House knowing the very important role that the major industrial sector plays in our state. We have supported those businesses and will continue to do so, and we will continue to engage with them and look for ways, certainly in my case, where the energy businesses are able to help those businesses with the current headwinds they are facing, noting that there are a much wider set of circumstances and multifactorial issues facing those businesses. To a large extent, it is incumbent on all of us to be supporting those businesses in this particular time. I will play my role in that. 

On the issue of transmission, and I think it is worth repeating, I stress that each MI has its own commercial arrangements that must be within the overall regulated allowable limit. The AER sets the maximum allowable revenue that TasNetworks can recover from all transmission customers, including major industrials.

Over a year ago, on 30 April 2024, the Australian Energy Regulator approved TasNetworks' final 2024-2029 regulatory proposal, which sets the businesses' allowed revenue, investments and pricing for the next five years, including major industrials. Actual costs to transmission customers are set through network charges. Transmission costs for individual major industrials are negotiated directly with TasNetworks within the maximum allowable levels set by the AER. 

The AER's role is to ensure that TasNetworks only recovers costs that are prudent and efficient as it performs its critical role of keeping the lights on. As I have said previously, I expect TasNetworks to continue to engage with major industrials as required to support efficient, safe and reliable network services, and importantly to help grow the Tasmanian economy, which is consistent with the statement of expectations. 

I can update the House, and I am pleased to report, that TasNetworks is regularly engaged in discussions on how they can support our major industrials with their energy needs at the lowest possible cost.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired. 

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary. It has gone 10.50 a.m., but as the minister has commenced his answering of the question, he can actually finish it but I will ask everyone to be aware of the minister's obligation to be elsewhere.

Mr WINTER - The minister said in his answer that the government will continue to support major industrials. I am wondering if he can provide an answer to Mr Mostogl's comments this morning. He is calling for the government to intervene and pause price rises for the next 12 months. Is the minister and the government going to adhere to Mr Mostogl's comments and calls on behalf of those major industrials? 

The SPEAKER - The supplementary does arise from the Minister's answer. Once again, we are aware that the minister needs to be somewhere else at 11.00 a.m.

Mr DUIGAN - I thank the member for the question. What I will absolutely commit to is to continuing to work with our major industrials for their long-term viability.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=42.5_D=26.2_C=0.59] Ms JOHNSTON question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.53 a.m.]
You have developed a reputation for ignoring experts. Tasmanians should be very worried that you think you know best. You ignored Saul Eslake's report on the state's finances. You did not like what the Tasmanian Planning Commission had to stay about the stadium, so your government has hired lawyers to attack it. Because Dr Gruen's truths about the stadium were inconvenient, you are now shooting the messenger.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=69.4_D=3.7_C=0.74] If you continue treating independent experts this way [Bookmark: Phr6_O=73.5_D=15.4_C=0.86] , who, with any integrity, will want to work for Tasmania again? You are creating an integrity vacuum in which only firms such as KPMG, well-known guns for hire, will be willing to do your dirty work. Is this what you are hoping for?

The SPEAKER -  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=89.8_D=17.1_C=0.67] As the Premier comes to answer the question, I remind all members that we are bound by Standing Order 2. Members are responsible for their own statements in this House. Privilege is applied to things in this place, but be very [Bookmark: Phr8_O=107.0_D=28.3_C=0.72]  aware of the obligations of privilege.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I acknowledge the member's question. I reject all the premises in that question. It is not me with the credibility problem when it comes to the stadium. I am afraid to say it is the TPC and Dr Gruen. That is where the credibility problem lies. That is not my fault, but you are backing it in. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=136.5_D=1.4_C=0.89]  When it comes  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=138.3_D=4.8_C=0.95] to your question on integrity matters [Bookmark: Phr11_O=144.8_D=10.8_C=0.85] , going on a personal attack and besmirching organisations at the end of your question really says a lot about your integrity and credibility.

Swift Parrot - Habitat Loss from Forestry

Dr WOODRUFF question to MINISTER for BUSINESS, INDUSTRY and RESOURCES, Mr ABETZ

[10.55 a.m.]
Recent research from Australia's leading swift parrot experts show more than a quarter of this lovely parrot's habitat has been disturbed, degraded or permanently deforested since the year 2000. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=179.4_D=29.1_C=0.81]  The research demonstrates production forestry is the main driver pushing this swift parrot to extinction - not bushfires, not climate change, not invasive species, but forestry. Not surprisingly, the removal of important swift parrot breeding forest has doubled since this government introduced the Rebuilding the Forestry Industry Act in 2014. 

Again and again you have told parliament and the media that your government listens to the science. Well, the science is telling you that your native forest logging is killing [Bookmark: Phr14_O=208.9_D=11.2_C=0.73]  the swift parrot. Do you accept that this government's policy is responsible for driving the swift parrot to extinction, and will you listen to the experts and end production forestry in swift parrot habitat?

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=221.0_D=6.5_C=0.85] Honourable Speaker, the answers are no and yes to the [Bookmark: Phr16_O=229.4_D=20.9_C=0.75]  member's questions. I do not believe that forestry is driving the swift parrot extinction, and, like always, we will listen to the experts. For those in the gallery who might not know - I understand the Greens know this, but they see it as an inconvenient truth [Bookmark: Phr17_O=250.9_D=5.4_C=0.76]  - every single coupe of forestry that is harvested is subjected [Bookmark: Phr18_O=256.6_D=29.8_C=0.79]  to the Forest Practices Authority considerations of all the environmental matters that should be taken into account, such as whether or not the particular coupe contains habitat which is important for our threatened species, be it the masked owl or be it the swift parrot. 

Just the other day, I took myself to Bruny Island to see where Sustainable Timber [Bookmark: Phr19_O=287.0_D=17.8_C=0.69]  Tasmania (STT) have converted - I forget how many - hectares of pasture to blue gum for swift parrot habitat. Do we get any comment from the Greens welcoming that move? 

Mr Winter - They could not get the ferry to get over there.

Mr ABETZ - and acknowledging that if STT did not do that, they could have delivered even bigger profits to the Tasmanian people. What do the Greens do? They attack Sustainable Timbers Tasmania for not making enough profit and return for the people of Tasmania. What Sustainable Timbers Tasmania does is use some of its profits for growing blue gum swift parrot habitat. There is not a single word of encouragement from the Greens, which tells me everything I need to know. Their crocodile tears for the swift parrot are about fundraising for the Bob Brown Foundation, an organisation that does not pay tax, might I add, and is a multimillion-dollar money-making machine. If their unwitting donors were to learn that Sustainable Timbers Tasmania was actually planting habitat for the swift parrot, their donations would diminish overnight. That is why that is an inconvenient truth for the Greens and for the Bob Brown Foundation.

They come into this place with their statements, but the facts are there for all to see. I indicate to the member that forestry does not occasion that which she asserts. That is false, that is wrong, and what is more, we have a Forest Practices Code that ensures that the habitat of any endangered species is well and truly protected.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary.

Dr WOODRUFF - The research that the minister just referred to are not my statements. It is research published in the Nature journal. You said just then, minister, that the coupes are subjected to environmental assessments to consider whether they have a swift parrot habitat and to make sure that they are protected. Because the evidence shows the decline in birds because of your forestry activity, do you accept that the laws need to be changed, that they are not working and obviously are not protecting swift parrot habitat?

The SPEAKER - The member's time for asking the supplementary has expired. I call the minister on the supplementary. It does arise from the original question.

Mr ABETZ - The evidence is overwhelmingly clear, and that is that forestry has not been responsible for the demise of any of our threatened species. Land clearing -

Dr Woodruff - We have just shown you that paper.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Mr ABETZ - Land clearing for the purposes of subdivisions, housing, dare I say it, agriculture as well, when you remove trees and do not replant them - and that is why, might I add as well, native forestry is so good. Whilst the Greens would now seek to assert that plantations ought to be the way to go, they are sterile monocultures at the end of the day, whereas native forestry replicates that -

Dr Woodruff - Just because you say black is white does not make it so.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Mr ABETZ - and allows nature to rehabilitate. That is why when we have regrowth forestry in this state, the Greens say 'this is old growth forestry, worthy of protection', which tells me and informs me that we do forestry exceptionally well.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired.


Pelvic Pain Foundation - PPEP Talk Funding

Ms ROSOL question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

[11.01 a.m.]
For the last three years, the Pelvic Pain Foundation has delivered a school program called PPEP Talk. The program has educated students about periods, endometriosis and other pelvic pain, equipping them with strategies to identify issues and to manage their health. Such programs are critically important anywhere, but particularly in Tasmania. Our students are missing more school due to periods and pelvic pain than anywhere else in Australia.

The Education Department recently advised PPEP Talk that they have denied their request for $115,000 in annual funding to continue the program for another two years. That decision has come despite the program's success across dozens of Tasmanian public schools. I have here letters of support from 12 schools and pages of positive feedback from students. I will send them to you. Given this is also very clearly a health issue, we are hoping you can save the day. Will you consider providing PPEP Talk with funding in the upcoming state budget?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I want to assure the House that our government does support Women's Health right across Tasmania, through the delivery of high quality healthcare every day. Women's health has been at the forefront of public discussion. I am really glad that it is. I really support the fact that women's health is at the forefront of public discussion.

Our priority is ensuring that all Tasmanians have access to the healthcare they need, when they need it. Currently the federal funding gaps, particularly relating to Medicare surrounding women's health are significant. In regard to the member's question, we are seeking federal government funding for a range of different initiatives to support women's health. We support and welcome federal Labor and the Coalition's pre-election commitments to a women's health package that was announced earlier this year. We believe that there should be more information and greater choice and lower cost to women across Australia, especially targeting critical areas like contraceptives, menopause, endometriosis and pelvic pain. 

In regard to the member's specific question in regard to education, that will be a matter that I will have to take up with the Minister for Education to find out more. Their budget allocation is very separate to my own, so I will need to follow it up. I assure the member that when it comes to endometriosis and other important women's health initiatives we recognise the challenges faced by women and girls living with endometriosis and how this condition can affect them in their daily lives. This is why we have invested in new staff, new technologies and public awareness campaigns to help women to obtain the care they need, when and where they need it.

In the 2024-25 Budget, funding was provided over three years for a targeted campaign to increase awareness, diagnosis and education for clinicians and the community to develop greater understanding about the impacts of endometriosis. This program will provide increased outpatient clinics appointments in public hospitals across Tasmania so that more women and girls have access to specialists for diagnosis, treatment and ongoing management options. We are also investing $4.7 million to deliver a new state-of-the-art surgical robot at the Launceston General Hospital for improved clinical outcomes for gynaecological surgeries.

We will continue to do all that we can to ensure that Tasmanian women and girls suffering from endometriosis can access timely, affordable care within the Tasmania public health system.

The SPEAKER - Before I take the supplementary, minister, were you saying that you would come back to the House with that information? I appreciate it is another minister's portfolio.

Mrs PETRUSMA - I will need to. It might take a little while to find out. I cannot guarantee I will be able to come back today.

The SPEAKER - No, that is fine. I just wanted to note that.

Supplementary Question

Ms ROSOL - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms ROSOL - Thank you, minister, for your answer and I appreciate that you will speak with the Minister for Education. The Education Department have already said they will not fund this project. We are asking if you will consider funding it from the Health budget rather than from the Education budget?

The SPEAKER - Minister, that was the original question.

Mrs PETRUSMA - Honourable Speaker, I really do need to find out from the Minister for Education the reasons why behind this. I cannot commit to getting back today, but I do commit to coming back with a response to the House. 

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Minister.


Energy - Transmission Costs for Major Industrials - Energy Minister's Statements

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.05 a.m.]
Your Energy minister has said publicly that our major industrials have faced 'nowhere near' a 20 per cent increase in their power transmission costs. He has repeated that assertion, or versions of it, more than half a dozen times in the parliament. This morning, the CEO of TMEC has confirmed the minister's statements were false. He and the CEO of the TCCI have warned that one or more of our major industrials could close if your policy is not reversed. How are you going to reverse your policy and ensure our major industrials have a future in our state if you will not even admit what your policy is? Do you have confidence in your Energy minister's statements and their accuracy?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, of course I have absolute confidence in our minister for Energy.

Mr Winter - How could you?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Nick Duigan is doing a tremendous job under very difficult circumstances. What our major industrials are facing are the global challenges that every government faces across the globe, particularly state, territory and national governments in this country. We have challenges with commodity prices. We have the tariffs and trade war.

Mr Winter - And your transmission costs.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We have China undermining the smelters, when it comes to what they are doing in intervening in the market, if I can call it that. There are major challenges for our major industrials, which we will work through. That is exactly why I wrote to not only the Prime Minister, Mr Albanese, but also Mr Dutton, the Leader of the Opposition, advocating for a national discussion on this particular matter.

Mr Winter - What are you going to do about it?

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I am answering the question. The question is: what have you done to argue Tasmania's case with your federal colleagues? As I understand it, the MIs have asked you to play a role in the national government and you have not done it.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You have been running around -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - as I understand it, hounding MIs for commercial-in-confidence information just to play politics. That is what you have done. You lack credibility.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We have our minister engaging with Labor governments in other states. We are engaging with the Labor government federally, and you are too scared to pick up the phone to your own Labor colleagues. 

Mr Winter - Why do you not give them a call and ask them what the answer is. Pick up the phone.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition. You are warned. 

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I should not be surprised, given yesterday, frankly, when you actually voted against an 80:20 funding split, which would cost this government and any government in the future millions and millions of dollars.

Ms Dow - You voted against Marinus.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ROCKLIFF - No Bridgewater bridge. Even the Greens, who hate roads, they hate travel -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left. Members on my right.

Mr ROCKLIFF - They hate anything with wheels. They hate it. They were on this side of the House backing in Tasmania and you were there left on your lonesome backing in federal Labor Party talking points. It was the most embarrassing thing I have seen from an opposition in many years, and given you lot, that is saying something.

The SPEAKER - Premier, your time for answering the question has expired. Before taking the supplementary, on behalf of Ms Badger, she is very fond of things on wheels.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - The tone of the Premier's answer really spoke volumes, honourable Speaker. I want to repeat the question. The question to the Premier was: Premier, do you have confidence in your Energy minister's statements and their accuracy? The Premier said he had confidence but he did not talk about the accuracy of those statements.

The SPEAKER - I will allow the Premier to answer the question.

Mr Abetz - Have another crack. 

Members interjecting.

Mr WINTER - Point of order. 

The SPEAKER - We will stop the clock. We will stop the interjections. I will hear the point of order.

Mr WINTER - Honourable Speaker, on the Standing Orders, the Leader of the House has just told the Premier to basically disregard your orders about being relevant to the question.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I will hear the debate. This could be quite interesting.

Mr Abetz - On the point of order, I have been grossly misrepresented by the Leader of the Opposition. I thought the Premier's answer was fantastic.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Leader of the House.

Mr Abetz - I was encouraging him to have another crack at the weak Leader of the Opposition.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Leader of the House, that will do. This is actually a serious matter. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I have not called the Premier yet. The nub of this matter actually goes to whether or not this House has been misled. That is the nub of it. I take the allegation seriously. They should never be made lightly and they must be responded to appropriately. It was a bit of fun for a little while, but I will ask the Premier to come to the question about confidence in the statements of one of his ministers. It is an important matter for this House to take seriously and I do not like spurious allegations. All allegations must be treated as if they are serious. Premier.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I am taking it seriously and I apologise, first, on misrepresenting Ms Badger's interest in motor sport as well. I have started my answer very seriously -

A member - Just making jokes.

The SPEAKER - Member for Lyons.

Mr ROCKLIFF - when I highlighted the real global challenges when it comes to what our major industrials are facing; not only our major industrials, but, of course, our small, medium and large businesses across the country.

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Standing Order 45, relevance.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You want the answer?

The SPEAKER - Thank you. I will take relevance. I call the Premier on relevance. Thank you.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I have great faith in our minister for Energy who is doing a very good job engaging across a lot of matters when it comes to the Energy portfolio. He has made it very clear in his answers today when it comes to the power price -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.


Palliative Care Tasmania - Funding
 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=20.2_D=13.0_C=0.72] 
Mrs BESWICK question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

[11.12 a.m.]
Tasmania's ageing population unfortunately means more and more people will require palliative care [Bookmark: Phr3_O=33.6_D=0.6_C=0.73]  support. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=35.1_D=28.0_C=0.88]  The latest State of Palliative Care Report delivers a sobering message about the increasing demand for services and the challenges facing the sectors who care for Tasmanians at the end of life. Despite the obvious need for strong advocacy, Palliative Care Tasmania faces an uncertain funding future. Why can we not deliver certainty for an organisation like Palliative Care Tasmania? Is it time for longer-term funding arrangements so we can plan properly for the challenges coming our way?

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=65.0_D=1.1_C=0.64]  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=69.1_D=23.2_C=0.79] Honourable Speaker, I assure the House that the Tasmanian government highly values Palliative Care Tasmania and I thank them for the outstanding, wonderful work that they do each and every day in empowering communities to be death and grief literate [Bookmark: Phr7_O=93.1_D=8.3_C=0.74] . 

The 2021-22 State Budget did provide $21.5 million for palliative care in Tasmania over four years to 30 June 2025 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=102.6_D=16.3_C=0.83] . Usually, in a state budget, we do funding across the forward Estimates and, of this: $10.5 million was made available for the home and community-based palliative care program; funding additional full-time equivalents across specialist palliative care services [Bookmark: Phr9_O=119.4_D=29.6_C=0.85] , including $6.8 million for the Palliative Care Partnerships Program and $4.25 million for Palliative Care Tasmania. This $4.25 million grant to Palliative Care Tasmania is to support them to continue with their community education and training activity, increase awareness of palliative care, providing sector wide leadership, and support their operations as a peak body for palliative care in Tasmania. 

In addition to the $4.25 million grant, the Department of Health has also commissioned Palliative Care Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr10_O=149.1_D=29.8_C=0.75]  to undertake specific pieces of work using funds from the Palliative Care Partnership Program. They are also convening the Partners in Palliative Care reference group and contribute to the department's palliative care clinical network. 

Palliative Care Tasmania are funded until 30 June 2025 at this stage, and all decisions that are ever made in regard to extension of funding are always considered as part of the normal budget [Bookmark: Phr11_O=179.6_D=28.6_C=0.77]  processes with the State Budget being delivered on 29 May 2025. I can confirm that Palliative Care Tasmania has made a submission to the State Budget community consultation process. 

I appreciate the member asking the question. When I was in opposition, I used to ask this question on behalf of just about every community sector organisation, because when you are in government - it does not matter if you are Liberal, Labor, Greens, whatever colour, [Bookmark: Phr12_O=209.3_D=15.6_C=0.85]  Labor-Greens - the standard response that you will get with regard to any community-sector organisation, or any funding needs of any organisation between now and  29 May - is that they will be considered as part of normal budget processes [Bookmark: Phr13_O=225.1_D=7.8_C=0.75] . That is the response that I am giving today.


Energy - Transmission Costs for Major Industrials -Trust in Government

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=234.9_D=29.4_C=0.83] Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.16 a.m.]
In October last year when you finally owned up to the scale of your stuff-up with the Spirits, the TCCI famously said it will be difficult to ever trust your government again. This morning the CEO of TMEC has been forced to take the extraordinary step of publicly confirming your government has imposed transmission cost increases of up to 20 per cent for Tasmania's most significant businesses. Michael Bailey, the CEO of TCCI, said this morning, 'This is a threshold moment for the Tasmanian Government.' [Bookmark: Phr15_O=265.1_D=14.6_C=0.81]  How can the business community have any faith in your energy policy if they cannot even trust you to be honest about it? How can you have any confidence in your Energy minister if this is what the business community is saying? 

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=284.1_D=20.3_C=0.76] Honourable Speaker, I like the way the member selectively quotes the business community because as I read the views of the business community, they wanted you to stand up for strong policy to take this state forward, but you are too weak to do so. It is a pattern of behaviour. Will you stand up and, firstly, produce an alternative budget for the House, which even the Greens do?

Mr WINTER - Point of Order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. I am asking a really important question. Can the Premier could be somehow relevant to major industrials, rather than a budget?

The SPEAKER - The Premier was only 30 seconds into his answer. He knows he has to be relevant in his answers and I am sure he will be.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I absolutely will be. I am demonstrating a pattern of behaviour of the Leader of the Opposition who, yesterday, cowered under federal Labor Party talking points. I know you are in administration by Canberra, but I did not expect you to run away from sticking up for Tasmania and Tasmanians because we would have no Midland Highway upgrade, we would have no Bridgewater bridge, if the 50:50 policy, as you advocated for yesterday, was in fruition over the last decade or more.

You sold out Tasmania and you had every crossbench question and Greens on this side of the House actually backing in Tasmania, but the TCCI -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark, Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

Dr Broad - You are not defending your minister.

The SPEAKER - Leader of Opposition business.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The TCCI said Tasmania deserves nothing less than a government with an ambitious reform agenda. Referring to the state of the state speech, this is, without doubt, the most ambitious reform-oriented state of the state speech in over 20 years.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left, use the standing orders or stop interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - These are pretty strong comments from my point of view, but they have also called on the Labor Party to put politics aside in the interest of Tasmania.

Ms FINLAY - Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. It was a very clear issue -

The SPEAKER - Thank you. I will call the Premier on relevance.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, and the member who rose for the point of order is the member, as I understand it, who is running around trying to get MIs to reveal commercial-in-confidence material.

Mr Winter – It is because we know the answer. Just give him a call and he will tell you what the answer is.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. If there is no supplementary question then the interjections will cease. 

Time expired.


CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Potholes - Financial Compensation

Dr BROAD question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE, Mr VINCENT

[11.20 a.m.]
I have had a number of constituents in Braddon whose cars have been damaged due to hitting potholes on the Bass Highway. When they applied for compensation, the road contractor simply denied responsibility without explanation. For example, Stornoway has written to my constituent, Darcy:

We have undertaken an investigation in relation to your claim and, after a review of the information provided by you and the records of asset inspections and maintenance activities, we respectfully decline your claim.

How is it that road contractors can simply deny responsibility for car damage due to hitting potholes without explanation or recourse?

Volunteering Strategy

Mr WOOD question to MINISTER for COMMUNITY SERVICES, Mr JAENSCH

In January this year, you put out a call for Tasmanians to have their say on Tasmania's first volunteering strategy. Every day, Tasmanian volunteers make an incredible contribution to our communities, with the economic value of volunteering estimated to be about $12.1 billion in our state in 2023. I understand forums were held on 25 February in Ulverstone, on 27 February in Launceston, and 4 March in Hobart. There was also an online forum on 6 March. On behalf of a member of my local community, can you provide some information on the key takeaways and what is next in the development of the strategy?


Greyhound Racing - Petition to End

Dr WOODRUFF question to MINISTER for RACING, Ms HOWLETT - 

My question is on behalf of Mark from Risdon Vale. Today in the other place, a petition of nearly 5000 Tasmanian signatures will be tabled calling for an end to greyhound racing. You have committed to cleaning up the sad disposal of dogs online once their 'usefulness' period ends but just this week, greyhounds are still listed on Gumtree, and there may be more coming across the Tasman now that New Zealand have led the way and announced an end to greyhound racing.

Despite putting more than $1 million into greyhound welfare, Tasracing has confirmed the Dogs' Homes of Tasmania and RSPCA, who rehabilitate and rehome these beautiful animals, are only eligible to competitively apply for a one-off grant of $5000 through a process only open for three weeks of the year. With a 12-month waiting list to enter GAP (Greyhounds as pets Tasmania), more dogs have been sent to these organisations, yet they get no more funding. Will you commit to providing more resources to organisations such as the Dogs' Homes and the RSPCA?


BreastScreen Tasmania - Reporting of Breast Density Levels

Ms HADDAD question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

My question is on behalf of my constituent, Alison. Around 50 per cent of women have breast tissue that is fibrous and glandular, otherwise known as 'dense breasts', which puts them at a high risk of breast cancer. While a standard 2D mammogram - which is the routine way to screen breasts for abnormalities including tumours - are an effective tool for women who do not have dense breasts, they are not the most effective way of detecting tumours in dense breasts. Indeed, tumours can be almost impossible to detect using this technology on dense breasts.

Australia's national breast screening program does not currently require women to be informed of their breast density when they have a standard mammogram. The RANZCR (Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists) has emphasised the importance of this information being provided to women. BreastScreen Victoria is now routinely informing women about their breast density levels after undergoing a standard mammogram. This gives women the option of seeking further screening, including contrast mammograms. Is the minister aware of this issue, and will BreastScreen Tasmania consider routinely reporting this information to women in this state?


Independent Education Review - Update

Mr FAIRS question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER 

Recognising that you released the final report of the independent review of education in Tasmania in January of this year, I understand the government has identified four areas where we can take immediate action to achieve improved outcomes. These areas include improving school staff well-being, ensuring alignment between our education system and the University of Tasmania, and getting ready to try a multi-school organisation model. What is the status of those immediate actions? How much progress has been made?

SITTING DATES

[11.27 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House)(by leave) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the House. I move -

That the House at its rising does adjourn until Tuesday 6 May, next at 10.00 a.m.

Motion agreed to.

MOTION

Leave to Debate Motion Without Notice

[11.29 a.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I seek leave to move a motion without notice for the purpose of moving the suspension of Standing Orders to debate the following motion. I move -

That the House -

Notes that Minister Duigan -

Stated on 2 April that our major industrials have faced nowhere near a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs.

Was asked on 3 April whether his statement on 2 April was a breach of the Ministerial Code of Conduct and whether transmission costs had increased for four major industrials by, 'almost 20 per cent' and said in response, 'I reject the assertion'.

Has repeatedly been asked about the accuracy of his statement since and has repeatedly denied his statement was misleading. 

Further notes -

The CEO of the Tasmanian Minerals, Manufacturing and Energy Council has today confirmed transmission costs have increased by as much as 20 per cent and warned that at least one of those is at risk of closure. 

The CEO of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has today stated there is a question mark over the viability of many of Tasmania's major industrials due to an increase in transmission costs. 

Agrees the Minister misled the Tasmanians in his statement on 2 April and has failed to correct the record on numerous occasions since.

Agrees the Minister has also misled Parliament in his answer to a question from Mrs Pentland on 9 April and failed to correct the record when given the opportunity.

Has no confidence in the honourable Nick Duigan MLC as a Minister of the Crown. 

We do not do this lightly. We must have confidence in the answers provided by ministers in this place. I no longer have trust that the answers I receive from the minister for Energy will be honest and accurate. The reason for that is because I have been asking these questions for days now. I started asking questions about this last week. I knew the answer that he provided to this House was wrong.

The reason I knew was because I had spoken to the major industrials. I have spoken to all of those who were struggling under the impact of transmission price pressures. They told me this was a huge issue for them. The comments today from the Tasmanian Minerals, Manufacturing & Energy Council (TMEC) and the Tasmanian Chamber of Industry and Commerce (TCCI) back that in. These are the industry groups that represent those businesses. They are telling us there is a major problem. They are telling the public there is a major problem. These are the lifeblood of Tasmania's economy, representing thousands of Tasmanian workers. Three of them are under enormous stress.

Trafigura has made announcements around Nyrstar. They have already talked about lowering its production on site, the potential sale of the asset and not going ahead with its cell room project that was so important and was supported by both sides of federal parliament and both sides of this state parliament. Boyer is up for sale and is under an agreement for sale at the moment with paper making obviously a difficult market for anyone to operate in. We have Liberty Bell Bay looking after more than 300 workers and contractors in the north under enormous financial pressure.

That is why I have personally raised this with the Prime Minister of Australia. I also raised it with the Premier of South Australia, Peter Malinauskas, who had been through this with Liberty in South Australia, when I went to visit him in Adelaide. That is why we find this so serious. It is important that we have ministers who are across the detail of this. There are only two excuses for the minister's answers: either he is not telling the truth, honourable Speaker, or he did not know. Either of those is a bad situation for those major industrials to be in. 

Energy import costs are so important for these industrials. It is the reason they are here. The reason they started in Tasmania and the reason they are still here is because of energy prices and transmission costs, that have been going up and up and up. We need a competent minister and we need an honest minister. I think we have demonstrated here today that we do not have either of those. This is urgent and that is why we are seeking leave. The answers over more than a week now have simply not been accurate.

I also heard today questions asked by other members, independent members, who raised really good questions about the accuracy of other answers that this minister gives. In the motion I have talked about the answer that was given to Mrs Pentland on 9 April, and then effectively admitting that the answer yesterday was wrong, but not correcting the record. The opportunity was right there in front of us. We saw it today, to Mrs Pentland's question. I asked him, effectively, to correct the record. I said that now is the time and you, honourable Speaker, invited him to correct the record. You gave him the instruction manual on how to correct the record and be a good minister. This is a minister who does not have any respect for the truth, nor any respect for the code of conduct for ministers that indicates exactly how they should act.

[11.33 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - I think anybody can see the subterfuge of this motion, which is designed to ensure that the day gets used up so we cannot get onto the forestry motion which would expose the Labor Party candidate for Bass -

Members interjecting.

Ms Haddad - Are you serious? The leader of government business who adjourned three hours early? You have the thinnest legislative agenda of any government in the history of this state.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left, the Leader of the Opposition was heard in silence, the leader of government business will be as well.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left. Member for Clark.

Mr ABETZ - and her gross missteps. What it discloses as well is that in a very close run contest in the seat of Lyons, where the overwhelming majority are backing our sustainable native forest industry, the Labor Party have this rogue candidate in Bass that may well erode that slim margin. What better thing to do than to try to lob a grenade into the place and suggest that we have no confidence in a minister?

There is no basis for the assertions being made by the Leader of the Opposition because what the minister has said time and time again is that, in real terms, that has always been his caveat. In those circumstances I have heard and noticed - or I have not heard anything, because the Labor Party are unable to contradict that statement from the leader.

Whether in dollar terms something might have gone up, as opposed to in real terms, these are the sort of things that are always matters of debate and consideration in these matters. To try to assert that somehow this is wanting of a no confidence motion is yet again another example of the Leader of the Opposition's overreach in relation to these matters. Under normal circumstances, the government would support the granting of leave and would not vote against it, but where there is a vote of no confidence in a minister attached to it, that becomes a serious matter. We are backing in our minister. I can indicate to the Speaker that we will be voting against the granting of leave and, of course, against the suspension, should it come to that.

This House has real issues to deal with in relation to forestry jobs, in relation to the headwinds that our major industrials are facing. These are matters that most people would be aware of. It is multifactorial. It is not simply an issue of energy prices. Energy price, yes, is a component, but it is not the sole and only component.

Furthermore, what I find bizarre in this debate is that the one thing Labor nailed their colours to the mast on, in relation to budget repair, was they were going to rip more money out of the government business enterprises. Here they are saying to reduce the prices, so how on the one hand are you going to reduce prices and then increase the take?

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance, on the seeking of leave.

The SPEAKER - Relevance applies to Question Time but we are addressing a seeking of leave and I will draw the member to it. There was some latitude given to the Leader of the Opposition. I will provide some latitude, but we are on a seeking of leave.

Mr ABETZ - Thank you, Speaker. You always know you are hitting the nail on the head when a spurious point of order is raised by the opposition. The issue is that the Labor Party has been -

The SPEAKER - Sorry, if I can, minister, that is a reflection on the Chair. I have upheld the seeking of leave relevance one, so thank you.

Mr ABETZ - Alright, I delete the word 'spurious.' They seek to disrupt the flow of the discussion in the Chamber because they know the point being made is one that will mortally wound them. They cannot argue on the one case, 'We are going to rip more money out of the GBE' and then, on the other hand, say to the GBE, 'You have got to reduce your prices.' You know what? That does not stack up. In the real world, that would be a big duck egg, a big failure, a big zero for you, Leader of the Opposition. It is no wonder no alternative budget has ever been produced by this hapless opposition unable to deal with the real issue. In 11 years of no alternative budget, here they are today not knowing whether they want to increase prices or decrease prices, but in any event they are going to move a vote of no confidence to ensure that we cannot discuss [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=7.6_C=0.57]  or that we run out of time for the very important issue of forestry. 

Time expired.

[11.38 a.m.]
Dr BROAD (Braddon) - [Bookmark: Phr3_O=39.1_D=30.0_C=0.87]  Honourable Speaker, this is urgent. Questions about the competence and the honesty of a minister is the most serious thing that can be brought before the parliament and what we have seen today from the Leader of the House is a desperate attempt to distract. What we see again, to the continual shame of this government, is that we have minister Abetz using forestry to protect [Bookmark: Phr4_O=69.5_D=26.5_C=0.85]  the incompetence of a minister. 

I will explain why that is the case, because we received the blue at 7.22 a.m. this morning and it did not contain motion no. 123. It is pretty obvious that the government started hearing the news reports that highlighted that their minister had been caught out - that his statements in this place that we have been prosecuting [Bookmark: Phr5_O=96.9_D=3.1_C=0.87]  for the last sitting week and this sitting week were wrong [Bookmark: Phr6_O=100.3_D=28.0_C=0.80] , and that there was a prima facie case that this minister had misled this parliament.

We had the Minerals and Energy Council CEO, Ray Mostogl, directly contradicting the minister and we had the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry directly contradicting this minister. What does this government do? To their shame, they updated the blue at 8.51 a.m. to include a forestry motion [Bookmark: Phr7_O=129.1_D=24.4_C=0.72]  so they could once again use the workers in the forest industry to protect their political incompetence, to basically use the forest industry as a political football to defend an incompetent energy minister. Shame, shame.

We saw this during the last election campaign, where they tried to use the forest industry as a political football. What was the result of that? We had the entire [Bookmark: Phr8_O=154.1_D=9.8_C=0.79]  forest industry standing behind Labor. That is what happened at the last election campaign. They obviously have not learnt from that if they would be so desperate as to include [Bookmark: Phr9_O=165.4_D=7.6_C=0.78]  a motion before this House, motion no. 123, as a shameless attempt [Bookmark: Phr10_O=173.6_D=30.0_C=0.83]  to use the forest industry as a political football instead of defending the competence and honesty of their minister. I say shame, shame, shame. 

They have a minister who has now not only misled the House on his comments around energy prices, but also today in his response to a serious question from the member for Bass, Mrs Pentland. That is now a pattern of behaviour. It was absolutely the case that he [Bookmark: Phr11_O=203.7_D=30.0_C=0.77]  misled the House in his response to Mrs Pentland, and what did he do? He did not correct the record. Now we have him not just misleading the House around energy prices, not just putting at risk thousands of jobs at our major industrials, we have him in a pattern of behaviour denying the knowledge it was obvious he had, not just for a few weeks and months, but for 18 months. 

All he had to do was say, 'My recollection was incorrect [Bookmark: Phr12_O=233.8_D=29.6_C=0.82] ; I have known about it for a much longer period.' There would not be a problem, but instead we see a pattern of behaviour. When minister Duigan gets a chance to be honest and gets many opportunities to correct the record, he doubles down and will not be honest.

That is why this is urgent, because we have to have confidence in ministers of the Crown in this place, and the Premier has to have confidence in his minister. This is equivalent to misleading a courthouse. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=264.0_D=24.9_C=0.71]  The Premier, over the time that he has been Premier, has been letting standards slip. It is time that this parliament stood up and said enough is enough.

We got to the point where confidence was such in the member for Bass, Mr Ferguson, that it became brutally apparent that he had to go and he did the honest thing and resigned, before, no doubt, there would have been [Bookmark: Phr14_O=289.6_D=15.1_C=0.65]  a no confidence motion passed in that minister. We are getting to the stage again where instead of ministers being honest, they double down when they are completely caught out. The pattern of behaviour we have in this place is to deny, deny, deny instead of doing the honest thing that the Westminster tradition requires, and that is to simply update the House and own the mistake. Instead we have a continual denial, and that is why this House needs to draw a line in the sand. 

We cannot have a minister who displays continual contempt for this parliament and has a pattern of behaviour of not updating the House when it is clear that he has been dishonest [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=24.2_C=0.75] , it is clear that he has made mistakes, it is clear that he has misled the House and he has had a chance to update the House. Because he has not, we have to hold him to account.

[11.43 a.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to talk to this seeking of leave. We will support the seeking of leave as is convention. We look forward to the debate and we will closely listen to the debate [Bookmark: Phr3_O=55.4_D=2.8_C=0.60] . A no confidence motion is an incredibly serious [Bookmark: Phr4_O=59.1_D=13.4_C=0.84]  motion to put to this House and we take that seriously. We do look forward to the debate and at face value, a debate about this at the very least is justified.

In going to the motion [Bookmark: Phr5_O=74.5_D=14.9_C=0.67]  and the notion of a 20 per cent increase, we have been looking for an explanation about the baseline of that - since when, and says who, have costs increased. We note that [Bookmark: Phr6_O=90.2_D=24.9_C=0.83]  the Leader of the Opposition and opposition members have repeatedly raised the contribution of Ray Mostogl from the energy sector this morning. We do not have that transcript, so if anyone could find that, that would be useful for us. We have not heard that interview. Contrary to what the member who just took his seat said, I do not believe that the Chamber of Commerce and Industry statement, which [Bookmark: Phr7_O=115.9_D=6.9_C=0.74]  we have seen, directly refute [Bookmark: Phr8_O=123.8_D=15.9_C=0.76] s the minister and his claim around 20 per cent. 

I am not trying to excuse the minister. I am making the point that I do not know that the statement directly refutes him. It certainly makes the argument that the major industrials are under pressure, and I acknowledge that, but it is not necessarily a direct [Bookmark: Phr9_O=141.4_D=27.8_C=0.73]  refutation of the minister's claims. We do have concerns about energy. There are significant energy problems, and when it comes to the major industrials, yes, the agenda of the government and indeed the opposition is of serious concern. 

I know it is not considered one of the major industrials necessarily, but a major industrial is Grange Resources in the north-west of the state. They have been told that their transmission costs as a result of Marinus will increase by 29.6 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=169.6_D=29.0_C=0.77]  per cent, I understand, certainly just over 29 per cent. The cable across Bass Strait and indeed the transmission lines come with significant cost, not only to the taxpayer and business, but also a cost to the environment and to the community. 

There is a lot of pressure and concern about those going forward. We saw some of that reported in today's media - on the ABC, in a national story, no less - about how transmission [Bookmark: Phr12_O=202.3_D=30.0_C=0.80]  is a serious concern for communities. The minister definitely has some issues to answer, and the Liberal government definitely has a policy position that is not only putting pressure on the major industrials but on the community and the environment as well. 

We will certainly support the seeking of leave. 

We are looking forward to hearing this debate and it seems we do have time as well. We do have time because the business of the [Bookmark: Phr13_O=232.6_D=25.0_C=0.55]  House is in absolute shambles. I echo the Leader of Opposition Business saying to have the blue updated just before 9.00 a.m. with business put on it and then business taken off it. We still certainly have the Community Protection Offender Reporting Amendment Bill. I understand there are extensive briefings being [Bookmark: Phr14_O=258.4_D=5.0_C=0.70]  proposed by the police about that because it is a significant piece of legislation. 

What do we get instead? [Bookmark: Phr15_O=263.8_D=29.3_C=0.76]  We get this weak, rhetorical, factually incorrect motion about native forest logging. I acknowledge this is government business. The government can choose what to do with their government business time and it is completely in their right to bring forward a motion. I do not criticise you in that context, leader, but the government business should be dealing with legislation. We should be dealing with legislation [Bookmark: Phr16_O=294.0_D=9.8_C=0.55]  and it is an indictment on this government that they are having to plug holes in the business of the day and keep us here by debating a ridiculous native forest motion and, again, we had a sum total of one bill tabled yesterday and another single bill tabled today. The business of the House is in absolute shambles. Despite the fact that that is happening, it is very clear that we have got a stadium bill coming that is going to ignore facts of the matter in terms of the serious planning complications around this stadium.

Dr Gruen did not talk about some of the contamination and the traffic and other issues, but the planning commission has. We are going to be asked to rubberstamp a stadium in a bill that we, collectively, have no expertise to offer an opinion on. 

[11.48 a.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I will support the seeking of leave. I will reflect on the leader of government business's comment saying in normal circumstances you would agree to the seeking of leave, but in this case I am not sure if this is any different to previous cases. The matter of confidence, want of confidence in a minister, is very important. If there is a question before the Speaker and before the House on a want of confidence, I believe as a matter of course the government would want to allow that debate and defend your minister and fight the good fight.

Conversely, it is up to the opposition to convince people that the minister has misled the House and therefore not lead to a censure for a transgression, but a no confidence, which would trigger him, in a normal set of circumstances, potentially turning in his resignation to the Premier and the Governor. That is not an insignificant debate to have. You have to prove the case. You not only have to prove that there is an argument, you have actually got to prove motive. You have to say it was a deliberate and manifest and purposeful act by the minister to mislead the House on a matter of fact, not a matter of opinion or not a matter of perspective. 

I acknowledge that the people who have been quoted in the argument to seek leave - and, again, I will support the seeking of leave - are people who are advocates for the industry.

If I close my eyes and think back 12 years, this is Will Hodgman versus Bryan Green. With energy policy, you are talking about commercial-in-confidence negotiations, over-the-fence price to our MIs. Our MIs are crucially important, but if you are going to accuse the minister of misleading the House and therefore this House having no confidence in him, you actually have to prove that he has done it wilfully. 

We need to be careful that, in our interest to represent the community and represent various sections of the community, that we do not cross the line between being overzealous advocates for a position which is a commercial negotiation, whether we like it or not, and a minister who is deliberately and wilfully misleading the House. That has to be proven and I will listen to the debate very, very closely and ensure that there is appropriate fact, not opinion, that gets you across the line on this.

I am disappointed the government has not taken seeking of leave in this matter. I would prefer you to allow that debate to occur so that you can get up and defend your minister. Again, the orders of the day have been thrown around; slightly awkward for you, it does not look good, and the positions made by the Leader of Opposition Business and the deputy leader are well made and I support. I will not extend my contribution further. I agree in a seeking of leave. Let us have this debate; but if the case is not made, what a waste of time.

[11.51 a.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise this morning to speak on the seeking of leave on this urgent matter. It is urgent because it comes to the integrity of the minister himself, the premier who, on his feet this morning, defended the minister, and of the government. It is urgent because there is no doubt and no question that the circumstances that our major industrials find themselves in as we speak - as we have been for the weeks that we have been prosecuting this with the minister - are critical and challenging circumstances. Our MIs are critically impacted by their energy pricing and by the uplift in their transmission prices. This matter is urgent for Tasmanians because of the significant role that our major industrials play within Tasmania.

The minister, on his feet this morning, said that our major industrials represent hundreds of workers in Tasmania. There are thousands of workers at risk in Tasmania because of the energy policy of this government. What Tasmanian Labor have been seeking to have this minister do is acknowledge those circumstances and the pressure that the lever that they can pull - energy prices and transmission costs - has on the operational impacts of our major industrials. Getting it wrong around how many people are in that industry is a demonstration of how low the amount of information this minister has for these critical operations. 

We question whether the minister in fact knew what the increases were with transmission. Therefore, on the first statement that he made on 2 April when he said, 'Our major industrials have faced nowhere near a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs', it is possible at the time that he had no idea. It is possible at the time that he was not aware of the critical impact that his portfolio responsibility is having on the thousands of jobs and the four MIs in Tasmania. 

If that was the case, you would hope, when questioned the very next day to confirm whether he continued to believe that to be true, that he would have had at least some conversations with the MIs, at least some conversations with advisers, perhaps some conversations with some former energy ministers or perhaps a conversation with the premier to clarify for himself if that was in fact correct or not. 

I take Mr O'Byrne's point: this is a significant and serious matter before the House about whether a minister has perhaps made a mistake; but the critical point is, when understanding that it was not correct, that he had a responsibility to immediately come to the House and correct at the very next opportunity, as required by the code of conduct.

He has had multiple opportunities to correct this. Tasmanian Labor, I think, have been very gracious and very generous in the time and the opportunities that we have provided for this minister to correct the record on 2 April - today is 10 April - eight days ago when he issued the press release to say that they face 'nowhere near a 20 per cent increase.' He has had eight days, either outside this place, and he has had multiple opportunities in this place, to correct the record. 

It has taken an extraordinarily rare event. It is very rare for TMEC to make statements publicly around the businesses that they represent, particularly around our MIs. Mr Mostogl, the CEO of TMEC, has extraordinarily come out to say where the minister says, effectively, transmission prices have gone down, that prices have gone up. I cannot imagine how the leaders of our MIs feel. 

I feel offended when he says that. I think is it a disgrace that at a time when the lever that the Tasmanian government can pull is to protect our MIs and the challenges and the risk of those jobs through his energy policy, that he says, you know what, I do not know what they are complaining about. Prices have actually gone down. That is so offensive. 

Mr Mostogl says that it is the largest increase in more than a decade. He says that the transmission costs for the four major industrials have risen by up to 20 per cent in the past financial year. He continues that the price rise could mean the closure of at least one of the companies. He is calling on the government to intervene.

If it was not real, if the MIs had not experienced up to a 20 per cent increase in their transmission costs, then TMEC would not be out on the public record. Equally, the TCCI, who at the end of last year said that Tasmanians would find it very difficult to ever trust this government again, have come out today backing in our major industrials. The TCCI clarified the position, calling on the government to do everything it can to protect our major industrials, because they are too important to lose, stating that this is a threshold moment for the Tasmanian government. 

Our major industrials are the lifeblood of our economy and without them power bills will go up. Hundreds of Tasmanians will be without a job. Communities will be put at risk. This is an urgent matter that must be dealt with today.

Leave granted.


SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS

Debate Motion Forthwith

[11.57 a.m.]
Mr WINTER - Honourable Speaker, I move

That so much of Standing Orders be suspended that would prevent such a motion from being dealt with forthwith.

I have heard the arguments from our side arguing about how minister Duigan has misled this place, but I have not heard a single argument from the other side about how he has not. minister Abetz went close to it and he talked about the issue of whether prices had gone up in real terms. That is not what minister Duigan said. He said very clearly that power prices had not gone up by anywhere near 20 per cent. I want to step you through the argument here as to why he has misled and this House should not have confidence in this minister anymore.

Last year, I visited one major industrial who gave me the nominal figure as to how much their transmission cost had gone up in a single year. My mouth was wide open. It was an extraordinary amount. This MI is under enormous pressure, as three of them are. The next time I visited another MI, I asked a similar question. They put it in percentage terms. It was astronomical. I visited another MI who talked to me about transmission prices and how much they had increased by.

I know for a fact from speaking to the major industrials, that transmission prices have gone up by an astronomical amount. When I turned up to parliament last week and asked the Minister for Energy about this really important issue for under-pressure major industrials, I was expecting the minister to say prices have gone up and this is how we are going to deal with it. Instead, the minister stood up and said that they had not. He said prices had gone down. The minister did not admit the truth of the fact.

Having heard from the major industrials and spoken to them at length about this, I was staggered. I had a whole pack of questions but I only asked two because honestly, I did not know what to do. He is misleading the parliament. I know that for a fact. Unless all these major industrials are telling me untruths, this minister has got it wrong, so he has misled.

I asked again the next day, assuming that he might have corrected the record. Again, he did not. Today I expected that, having heard the contribution publicly from Ray Mostogl, who is the head of the peak body that represents those major industrials, or three of them at least, that the minister would say, 'Okay, I got it wrong and correct the record.' Once again, he just doubles down and tells mistruths to this place.
Ray Mostogl has said that prices have gone up by up to 20 per cent. It is reported in the ABC to be between 15 per cent and 20 per cent. We know it is true because the peak body that represents the major industrials is telling the public, have made a public statement, and they have told me. I know for commercial reasons they are not going to come out and outline exactly how much their power prices have gone up by. Obviously, they are not. That is why they have peak bodies. That is why they have people like the TCCI and TMEC that represent these industries.

The case has been made that we need to fully debate this. This House must have confidence in its Minister for Energy. We must have confidence especially at this time for a minister for Energy who oversees such critical industry for our state. It is absolutely critical. Nothing could be more serious than the future of those workers in those workplaces: at Bell Bay in the north, at Boyer and down at Nyrstar. There are under enormous pressure already. There are global issues, absolutely. Paper-making is going to be really difficult commercially in the future. They are under stress. The last thing they need is government policy settings that work against them, and even worse, a minister who does not admit to it.

Minister Duigan's answers today are not truthful. His statement saying that prices had gone up by 'nowhere near 20 per cent' is not truthful. It is a lie. There is no other way to say it. He put it down in writing and he should have corrected the record. The ministerial standards that the Premier outlines to his ministers have not been lived up to.

The government has not made the case as to why this is wrong. They have not defended him. Tell us how his statement on the 2 April that said that transmission prices had gone up by 'nowhere near 20 per cent' is accurate? If the House is going to have confidence in this minister, that is the argument they need to make.

It is not accurate. He should have come in and corrected the record. He did not. He has had multiple opportunities.

I have not come to the independent member for Bass's question, which is clearly untruthful. He was directed to how to answer the question and did not. It is a pattern of behaviour here. The House must hold this minister to account.

[12.02 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Deputy Premier) - Honourable Speaker, I am pleased and proud to stand here as a Deputy Premier, but also as a former minister for Energy and Renewables, and someone who has total confidence in the Minister for Energy and Renewables, Mr Duigan, and his work. I know and understand the commitment that he has, not just to major industrials but to growing our strong economy.

This is a political stunt by state Labor on the last day of sitting prior to the Easter break. We have work to do today, and you are trying to capture the media's attention to distract the government from the parliament's important work. This is a stunt by state Labor and you know it. You know it, because you are trying to avoid scrutiny of your decision where you sat and voted for less funding for Tasmania's roads and bridges.

A member - Just desperate. Defend your minister - he has misled the House.

Dr Woodruff - Yes, that is right.
The SPEAKER - Members on my left. We are on an urgency motion at the moment.

Mr BARNETT - We are talking serious implications of going away and tearing up the 80:20 rule. You have done that. This is also a distraction from the increased taxes and charges that Tasmanians will pay as a result of any Labor-Greens government going forward, as a result of your commitment to increasing own-source revenue to 40 per cent. That means more land tax, it means more stamp duty, it means more payroll tax, it means Tasmanians will pay through the nose.

We are talking about GBEs today, as we have been all of this week. State Labor and the Leader of the Opposition know full well that you want to milk those GBEs for all they are worth, absolutely hike up those levies and fee costs for Metro, driver's licences and the like - and, of course, milk Hydro, TasNetworks, and Aurora Energy, our energy GBEs. We have a very big plan in terms of the GBE reforms, and Labor does not like it. This is one mighty distraction.

I think the independent member for Franklin made it very clear a few moments ago. I wanted to concur with those remarks. This is a very serious motion that you are bringing on to distract the parliament. It does need to be a deliberate misleading; it does need to be purposeful. There is a history. If you have a look at the history of motions like this, you need to take that into account very seriously. I draw that to your attention.

You are talking about major industrials who have commercial-in-confidence agreements. The minister for Energy made reference to the 10-year agreement of Liberty Bell Bay on a number of days this week. Are you talking about reaching in and looking at commercial-in-confidence information?

The minister has been very clear, and the Australian Energy Regulator, the independent entity, has made it very clear that over the last 10 years, there has been a reduction in real terms for those transmission costs. In terms of Tasmania, we are pleased and proud in terms of real terms of electricity prices for residential and business customers that are regulated. Under state Labor and the Labor-Greens government, it went up 65 per cent.

We will not have a bar of this distraction and this political stunt by state Labor. Yes, we are going into the Easter break, and that is why you have brought this on. We will not have a bar of that.

We do know that Labor's policy, with respect to the North West Transmission Developments, is to hike up transmission costs big time, through the nose. That will be for everyone - not just major big businesses, or small or medium-sized businesses, but residential customers.

Mr Winter - It is your own project.

Mr Willie - You are getting nowhere with this rubbish.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr BARNETT - That is the Labor policy that the Leader of the Opposition announced just a few weeks ago. Let us be very clear: this is one almighty distraction. We will not have a bar of it. We have total confidence in our Minister for Energy and Renewables, and we stand by it.

[12.07 p.m.]
Dr BROAD (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, this House needs to have a full debate on this matter, and that is why I believe we should suspend Standing Orders to have this debate. We can boil it down to simple arguments. I understand the position of the independent member for Franklin in that we do have to justify the debate. We absolutely do. I would also argue that we need to have more time to thresh this out properly so we can make a decision as a parliament whether this minister has misled the House or not. Our argument is that he has misled the House. We saw it today. We have had the chief executive of the Minerals, Mining & Energy Council, Ray Mostogl, put on the record that there have been increases at the major industrials between 15 and 20 per cent this financial year, and again we heard the minister directly contradict that and say there have been decreases. Who is telling the truth? Who do we have confidence in? 

It has been backed up by the CEO, Michael Bailey, who said that this is a threshold moment for the government. We have people who are actually talking about the stress and strain on our major industrials and the massive risk, and we have a minister who is standing up and saying there is no problem because prices have actually gone down. This is not just about confidence in the minister in terms of his honesty; it is also about his competence. How can we have industry representatives, both the TMEC and TCCI, saying that the major industrials have a massive problem, and have a minister standing up saying there is no problem because prices have gone down?

An additional matter is the serious nature of the minister's comments today in relation to Mrs Pentland's questions. There is absolutely a case that he misled the House - by his own comments. That alone should trigger a full debate. That is why I believe we should suspend Standing Orders and, as the Deputy Leader of the Greens suggested, there is actually not a lot on the blue that is more important than having this debate. I might have paraphrased him a little bit there - he is not in the Chamber at the moment - but we really need to have this debate, because energy is such an important portfolio. The strength and the future of the major industrials is a massive issue for this state and here we have representatives of those major industries directly contradicting the minister. We need to have this full debate and that is why we should suspend Standing Orders.

I believe that we have made the case for seeking suspension, and during a full debate we will then be able to thresh out these issues and put before the parliament our argument that we have no confidence in this minister. Instead, what we have is pretty hollow attacks on Labor, which is absolutely not relevant to the matter before the House. We see the ad hominem attacks - the personal attacks on us - rather than defending the minister.

Has the minister been honest when he said that our major industrials have faced nowhere near a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs? The public of Tasmania has to have confidence that when a minister stands up in this place and says something, it is true. If it is not true, then it is beholden on that minister to correct the record at the earliest opportunity. We believe that the minister has misled the House when it comes to the transmission pricing for the major industrials, but we also believe that this minister has misled the House in relation to Mrs Pentland's questions.

There has to be a full debate. We have to thresh this out so that the people of Tasmania can understand not only the depth of the issues that we are addressing, but hear a proper defence from the government. Where is the proof in their statements? If we have a full debate then we can then move on, one way or another. We believe that this parliament should not have confidence in the minister because of his behaviour. Let us have the full debate. Let us not cut it short by just having the 35-minute debate that we are having now. Let us thresh it out - give the government an opportunity to defend their minister and give the Parliament of Tasmania an opportunity to also make a judgment on that minister, because these are very serious issues. These are massive industries for Tasmania and they need to have faith in their minister.

[12.12 p.m.]
Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) - Honourable Speaker, that was a bit lacklustre from the Leader of Opposition Business. They have not presented a case at all. If you are going to come into this place and waste the parliament's time, at least put some oomph into it and present a coherent argument, which you have not done today. I have full confidence in Mr Duigan for many reasons. We have spoken a number of times today about the challenge of the Energy portfolio, particularly in these really difficult [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.2_D=7.0_C=0.92]  times in the global environment with China [Bookmark: Phr3_O=38.9_D=22.0_C=0.79]  undermining the smelter market, commodity prices, and tariff and trade wars around the globe. It is not only our MIs that are under pressure, but also small, medium and large businesses, not only in Tasmania but also across the nation, and we have spoken about this many times.

On the matter concerning Mr Duigan, he has clearly not misled the House. Overall transmission costs have gone down over the past 10 years in real terms. My information is according to the AER reports. I understand in real terms this decrease is about 3 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=86.4_D=5.9_C=0.84]  per cent. We have created, notwithstanding the challenging environmen [Bookmark: Phr6_O=92.8_D=29.3_C=0.84] t - that needs to be put into context in this debate. 

What the Leader of the Opposition is doing is trying to assert himself and find a distraction from what has been a very poor performance by the Labor Party over the last two weeks. I am speaking particularly of the performance yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party more generally [Bookmark: Phr7_O=122.5_D=2.2_C=0.96]  when it comes to essentially [Bookmark: Phr8_O=126.6_D=14.8_C=0.74]  cowering to Canberra through Labor Party talking points and doing over Tassie. You are effectively advocating for [Bookmark: Phr10_O=148.3_D=3.6_C=0.81]  more funding to go to every other state than Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr11_O=153.2_D=8.5_C=0.66] , which I find absolutely extraordinary.

The SPEAKER - I remind the House we are on an urgent seeking of leave motion. Unless you are discussing the timing and the business of the House today - urgency, please.

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=165.5_D=24.5_C=0.73] This is a distraction, and I would say to the honourable member who just resumed his seat that the motion that we intend to debate today is a very important motion about support for the forest industry in this state, on which you lot are all over the place, as usual [Bookmark: Phr13_O=190.6_D=7.2_C=0.71] . Back to the substantive discussion we are having here - these are commercial-in-confidence negotiations [Bookmark: Phr14_O=198.8_D=27.4_C=0.85]  and that point needs to be made very clearly, which I believe was a point made by the member for Franklin. Clearly, there is an absence of information in the argument you are prosecuting today, which highlights the fact that you are using this as a distraction for your own very poor performance. 

Not only have you advocated this week [Bookmark: Phr15_O=227.0_D=5.7_C=0.47]  for more taxes, you also want to ensure [Bookmark: Phr16_O=233.2_D=24.7_C=0.76]  that we get less money for our roads and bridges from Canberra. Give that to other states of Australia. I had a bit of a Google last night when I could not believe what I witnessed yesterday, and I thought: what would the other premiers around the country think of this? [Bookmark: Phr18_O=261.1_D=0.9_C=0.30]  Well, Anastasia Palaszczuk [Bookmark: Phr19_O=263.5_D=0.9_C=0.10] , Chris Minns and Jacinta Allan are all standing up for the 80:20. We have Labor premiers across the nation standing up for 80 per cent federal funding and 20 per cent state funding, and you lot want 50:50. 

The SPEAKER - I bring the Premier to relevance, and with that, I ask the Premier to resume his seat. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=288.6_D=9.2_C=0.76]  I will give Mrs Pentland the call. I remind people we are on an urgency motion. You may discuss other matters pertaining to the business of the day, but could we please stick to urgency? 

[12.17 p.m.]
Mrs PENTLAND (Bass) -  [Bookmark: Phr22_O=299.1_D=5.9_C=0.81] Honourable Speaker, a motion of no confidence in a minister is a serious matter and a very high threshold must be met before it should be considered. While I would encourage the energy minister to be direct and accurate when answering questions, I do not support this motion of no confidence and therefore will not be supporting the suspension of Standing Orders. 

We have asked the Energy minister about a serious matter over the last two days. This issue is holding up critical housing developments, costing consumers dearly and creating genuine safety concerns for workers. We need to sort out this standoff between TasNetworks and some local councils before it hurts our economy even more. I understand the issue has been hindering developments for about 18 months. The reason we asked the minister to clarify when he first became aware of the problem was not to try and produce a gotcha moment, but to properly understand how seriously the government is taking the issue.

Yesterday, the minister said he had been aware of the issue for a month or two, but in March he told the National Electrical and Communications Association that he raised the matter with TasNetworks last year. I would like the minister to clarify this. This is a big issue affecting a lot of people, especially in my home city of Launceston. I would strongly urge the minister, TasNetworks and the City of Launceston to resolve it as a matter of urgency. It is not a trivial matter, and the timeline around an issue like this is important. 

The future of our major industrials is also a critical issue. I understand why the opposition is seeking answers over the price they are paying for power. I would again urge the minister to be direct in his responses, but I will not be supporting this no-confidence move or the suspension of the Standing Orders.

Mr BAYLEY - Honourable Speaker, I rise to rise to talk of the urgency on this and indicate that we will support. This is urgent. There is nothing more urgent than debating a no-confidence motion. A no-confidence motion is the most serious thing that can be brought to this place, and it carries significant consequences for the minister, and we take that very seriously. We certainly support going to a fuller debate on this and listening very carefully. We have some information, the information that has been presented to date. We still do not have access to Ray Mostogl's own words in the radio interview this morning. We will keep seeking that information and we will listen carefully to the debate. 

We are no fans of this minister in the energy space. We are really concerned about the direction he is taking us in and the policy direction that the government is taking us in. In the Parks portfolio, we have significant concerns about this minister signing away public land to a developer that has lost all credibility, that has had to change the proponent of his proposal from a liquidated entity to his own person. Yet, this minister is quite content to sign over a World-Heritage-listed island, in an exclusive lease, to a single person who has the capacity to then refuse entry to people. We have significant concerns about this minister and his honesty. 

In terms of the substantive notion of this motion, we are still going to need more information. We will still listen really carefully to the debate. We will take this incredibly seriously. It is a very serious matter. It is urgent. We do feel as if this House has the time to consider this issue. To listen to the Deputy Premier, then the Treasurer come up and talk about the important businesses of the House - well, the business of the House is so important they had to inject, at the last minute, a nonsense motion about forestry just to keep us busy talking for- I do not know how long we will talk for on that because it is an unlimited debate. They could talk it out all day. 

They still have not brought on the Tasmanian Community Fund bill. Why is that? Is that because you know you are going to lose that vote? These are the things we should be doing, but they are not even prepared to list them on the blue. The business of the House was communicated to us in an absolutely shambolic way. We did not get any information last night. I sought additional information from the Leader of the House quite late last night saying, 'Where is it? What are we going to be doing?' We got it 7 o'clock this morning, and then that was updated a subsequent time. 

We do not accept the notion that the House is simply too busy to be able to debate this kind of thing. We respect the opposition's right to bring no-confidence motions to this House. We have done it this year in relation to the Premier and [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.0_D=0.5_C=0.24]  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.6_D=24.2_C=0.79]  the pokies precommitment card, so we take it very seriously. We absolutely are engaged in this issue and look forward to the debate and will participate, but I say again in relation to the motion, we will be listening really carefully. We will be seeking more information. Some staff and others are trying to get that information and talk to other people. We will be considering the specifics of the motion really carefully and weighing up [Bookmark: Phr4_O=56.7_D=4.0_C=0.85]  the implications of it. 

We are cognisant about what this means [Bookmark: Phr5_O=61.6_D=29.4_C=0.88]  for the minister, both professionally and personally, and also the reputation of this House and how we manage these kind of issues. We take it seriously. We are going to be listening carefully, but we support the urgent nature of this, and the allocation of a significant amount of time, so that we can flesh out these issues properly. We can get the information we need to make an informed [Bookmark: Phr6_O=91.5_D=14.6_C=0.86] , rational and logical decision that is in line with the principles of the parliament and what is expected of a minister of the Crown. In saying that, I will take my seat and say we will support urgency and we look forward to the debate if it gets over the line.

[12.24 p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker,  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=106.8_D=26.0_C=0.69] I will only speak briefly on this. I have been listening to the arguments and I will reluctantly agree to get this to the next stage, only on the basis that I believe the opposition has made a case that the bloke struggles on his feet in Question Time; but I do not think the government has done the job in defending in terms of the motion. You need to argue [Bookmark: Phr8_O=133.6_D=0.9_C=0.52]  the facts on the case [Bookmark: Phr9_O=136.3_D=29.7_C=0.70] . If you are going to get to the next stage of arguing this, you have to at least start and ask the House not to go to the next stage. You have put on the record why you believe this House has confidence in him. I was expecting that and I have not heard it. 

In terms of the argument, essentially we are going on one person's view. I am not casting any shade on Mr Mostogl. He is a [Bookmark: Phr10_O=166.2_D=30.0_C=0.67]  fantastic Tasmanian. He has a long track record of commitment to our community and advocacy and passion. He is a very well-respected member of the community but even his own quote, he says 15 to 20 per cent this financial year. If we are moving a motion of no-confidence in the minister on a quote from an industry advocate, with the greatest respect to the advocate, it is a stretch; but because the government have not defended their minister, I will let you get to the next step. 

I suggest [Bookmark: Phr11_O=196.3_D=29.6_C=0.73]  that we time limit that and also - I am not sure if I can do that formally now, but we can put a time limit on this debate so the House can move on quickly, so the arguments can be heard, but the appropriation of Mrs Pentland's argument in your motion, clearly without consultation, demonstrates again you need to work with the crossbench, not around us. You rarely talk to us and when you do it is bludgeoning us. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=226.9_D=13.4_C=0.77]  If you want the support of the House on these kind of matters, appropriating a crossbencher issue, not with her support, demonstrates again that you are misreading the House.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=240.6_D=6.4_C=0.85] I will vote to get to the next stage and I move [Bookmark: Phr14_O=248.2_D=15.2_C=0.73]  - and I have not thought about this or consulted, so I do not want to do this, because putting a time limit on this debate is probably the most reasonable thing; two hours or something. I do not know if that is enough for the opposition to allow people to have their speech. Then we can have their [Bookmark: Phr15_O=264.4_D=27.0_C=0.78]  arguments put, then the matter can be put and then we can move on. I will leave that to others if they are able to move that. Putting a time limit is sensible. It is a tradition of the House. We have done this before on many occasions. An endless debate on something that you have not made the case for, but also the government have not defended their minister well, is an enormous reach.

The SPEAKER - If I can give you some guidance [Bookmark: Phr16_O=292.0_D=7.2_C=0.64] , it is a procedural motion now if you wish to extend the time. It is not uncommon and it has been done in the past, to put time limits on debates, usually on [Bookmark: Phr17_O=300.9_D=3.6_C=0.72]  ones that have been debated several times, but you are in a position to be able to then move a time limit. That is a quick procedural vote and then we can continue with the motion.

Mr O'BYRNE - I believe there is time left in the debate. I will leave that to the leader of government business to negotiate with the Leader of Opposition Business to seek if there is an agreement on that.

[12.27 p.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to speak in support of the suspension of Standing Orders to debate what is an urgent matter. It is urgent because there are two issues here before the House. The first is that the government has failed to provide or mount a defence of their minister today. In fact, they went as far as to block further discussion on this by not even allowing the initial discussions to take place through the first motion before the House. It is purely a protection racket. It is a problem when the Premier comes in here and has to fire insults across the Chamber rather than mount a defence of his minister.

I remind the House that this matter is urgent, and because the urgent nature of it and the fact that this information and direction taken by the opposition occurred only in the last little while, we were not able to speak directly with the crossbench around it. This came through the further evidence that was presented today through Question Time. I note Mr O'Byrne when he is putting forward his amendment as well that that is the same -
The SPEAKER - There is no amendment before the House.

Ms DOW - When he spoke about the amendment: the fact that, thinking of that on your feet at that time, it is a similar scenario in that we would have spoken to the crossbench had there been time. I note those comments.

I take Mrs Pentland's point when she presented to the House and spoke about her disappointment with the minister's misleading of the House, and not providing accurate information to her, and the impacts that that will have on her electorate. I believe it is disappointing that the crossbench will not present this today.

The SPEAKER - 'Members of'. The only person Mrs Pentland is speaking for is Mrs Pentland. She has no right to speak for anyone else.

Ms DOW - Sorry, the member who spoke. I understand that. I stand corrected. A bit of humility, Speaker, which would not go astray on the other side of the House.

I have been in this place for seven years and Dr Broad is quite right in stating that the standards in this House have deteriorated significantly during that time. In years gone by, ministers would have stood aside for doing the wrong thing. We had a minister who forgot to build a berth for the billion-dollar ships in this state and it took weeks for him to step aside and do the right thing by the Tasmanian people.

We are not embarrassed on this side. You should be embarrassed on that side about the incompetence of your ministers and the conduct of your government. This evidence base is here in black and white for all to see. The other contributors from our side have spoken about the evidence base that substantiates the fact that this minister has misled this House on two occasions now.

It is everybody's responsibility in this place to uphold parliamentary standards. That is the expectation of the Tasmanian people when they put us in this place. This government has had minister after minister who has left this place under scandal. It has not been under the leadership of a strong premier that has directed that. The Premier had the audacity to assert across the Chamber that our Leader of the Opposition was weak. Well, where is he on this? He could not even mount a defence to defend his minister or provide evidence to say that he has not misled the House. That is weak, honourable Speaker, and he is not even here for the debate.

I think your heart is not in it. I think your heart is not in defending your minister. I think that he does not have the confidence of those on the other side. If he did, you would be open to debating this. You would let every member of this parliament have their say and then a decision be drawn from this Chamber about the merits of that argument. It is weak.

Time expired.

The SPEAKER (Ms O'Byrne) - The question is that suspension of Standing Orders be agreed to.

MOTION

Want of Confidence in Minister for Energy and Renewables

[12.40 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I would like to start by thanking the House for acknowledging the seriousness of this debate and allowing it to happen today. It demonstrates that this parliament is looking to make sure they are holding their ministers accountable, even if the Premier of Tasmania does not. They have said that they want to hear the case. We have a case, and it is a pretty clear one.

In the introduction to this debate, the government has not mounted a single argument to why this motion is not true. We had the Leader of the House stand up and talk about 'real power prices' or something or other, which has nothing to do with the motion. Then we had the Premier of Tasmania stand up and mount a case for something else, instead of for his minister. The minister's behaviours are indefensible, and that is why they cannot defend them.

The minister's behaviour towards the major industrials today has been shameful. His performance in the parliament has been even worse, because what is even worse than incompetence is dishonesty and telling lies. I am convinced this minister has told lies to the public and told lies to the parliament, and that is what we are here prosecuting.
As I said earlier, I did not expect that asking this question would lead to the point where we are. In fact, I might take the independent member for Franklin up on what he said earlier. We did not have a no-confidence motion drafted before Question Time. We drafted it right at the end, because his answers were so ridiculous we felt we needed to. On behalf of the House, someone had to stand up for honesty, for accuracy, and for Standing Order 2.

The Standing Orders clearly say, 'You must not mislead.' The minister is from another place, but when he is in this place, he should adhere to our Standing Orders. No matter where the minister is from, whether he is from the other place or this place, he should uphold the Ministerial Code of Conduct. I will read from the Ministerial Code of Conduct:

Misleading statements:

Ministers must not deliberately make statements that mislead Parliament or the public and in line with parliamentary practice are obliged to correct the record in a manner that is appropriate to the circumstances, as soon as possible after any incorrect statement is made. 

On 2 April, minister Nick Duigan issued a media release that said the transmission prices had not gone up by anywhere near 20 per cent. That statement is categorically untrue. If the government has had any conversations with any major industrial anywhere, they will know that that statement is categorically untrue. If they had evidence to the contrary, they would just make the argument. 

They are not making the argument because they know it is true. The Premier keeps referencing conversations that Labor has had with major industrials and that is true. I have met with or spoken to every major industrial in the last week and multiple times. I met with Liberty Bell Bay with Ms Finlay three or four times in the last 12 months. We have been up on site twice. I have been to the Zinc Works three or four times in the last few years. I have sat in at Boyer for hours with Dr Broad talking about energy and resource policy with them. 

We have been to Rio twice. I have spoken to Rio multiple times. We have spoken to Rio countless times and met with them and are looking forward to meeting with them again in the future. We continue to deal with and engage with major industrials, who I trust to tell us the truth. They have told me what is going on, and that is that transmission prices are a huge issue for their business and for their sustainability. 

The government has a problem on its hands here. They need to maintain a position that major industrials have not seen a transmission increase of anywhere near 20 per cent. It is not true. Today's argument from the government does not exist because there is not one. The motion is so simple. It is accurate because it is the truth. We had a minister for Energy who stood up here on multiple occasions and denied the truth. The truth is that this is really hurting our major industrials and their workers, and putting them under significant stress. 

I do not deny that there are serious global threats to our industrials, particularly through the Trump tariffs and through the major global shocks that we talked about on Tuesday during an MPI on exactly that, but we need to do absolutely everything that we can as a state to protect jobs in this state, to protect those major industrials. The first stage of doing that is acknowledging there is a problem. 

For major industrials, the problem is that transmission prices are going up. To acknowledge that requires honesty from the minister. This motion goes to the dishonesty of the minister. When he made that comment on 2 April, when he put that statement out and said that prices had not gone up by anywhere near 20 per cent, he was not being honest. Can you believe it - the headline on the statement was 'Labor can't be trusted.' Minister Duigan said, 'Our major industrials have faced nowhere near a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs as claimed by the opposition.' It is actually even worse than the motion says. In one case one of the major industrials showed me their transmission price increases stepped up over the next few years, and it is actually much higher than 20 per cent. The minister is arguing that they have gone up by nowhere near 20 per cent, when in fact they have gone up by much more than that.

On the public comments from their representative - these businesses do not and cannot speak publicly about their own commercial terms; of course they cannot. That is why they have TMEC, that is why they have this TCCI. We see this across business, that when they have problems, they have industry representatives to represent them and defend their interests. In this case, their interests are being attacked by the transmission policies of this government, and by the inability of the government to act because it will not admit the truth.. There is a case for Tasmania's government to step up and support these industries, to support them by working through what the transmission issues are, and getting those prices down as low as possible. As the industry said today, there should be a pause. That is what they are calling for, but how is this government going to pause and respond to their call if they do not admit they are going up in the first place? That is where they are led to today.

These businesses are so important. There are thousands of jobs attached to them and they are under so much pressure. We have the Liberty Bell Bay site, which is owned by GFG, Liberty Alliance and, effectively, by the Gupta Group, associated with InfraBuild, which is in danger of breaching its agreement with the lenders. This will happen in the next three months unless the steel business owned by British industrialist, Sanjeev Gupta, improves its earnings, according to Fitch Ratings.

The credit rating agencies run through the limited potential for earnings to improve given the increase in cheap steel products, largely from China. It goes through the issues that led to Whyalla needing to be taken over by the South Australian government in concert with the Australian Government. This was a huge issue for regional jobs in that area, all of which was under the same ownership as Liberty Bell Bay.

We hope that Liberty Bell Bay is insulated enough in terms of the corporate structure for them to be able to continue. That is why we continue to speak to and deal with that business. We want to make sure we are giving them all the support we possibly can. That is why we continue to talk to Nyrstar, along with its parent company, Trafigura, and make sure they are in the best position. The Premier was right today, actually. One thing he said was right; he said they have asked Labor for help. Absolutely they have. They have directly asked me for help. I spoke to them earlier this week and I asked, 'Have you got a proposal ready to go? I want to come in and fight and back you in'. They said the proposal was not ready, but as soon as it is they will let us know. We have been in constant contact with them, ready to make sure we are supporting them.

My advocacy for these businesses is not writing a letter and then immediately giving it to the Mercury. My advocacy for these businesses involves directly understanding the issues they are facing and understanding what the Tasmanian government can do and what the opposition can do to hold this government to account and learn how we can advocate for them. We do this not just for the workers, not just for the businesses, but for the communities they represent: towns like George Town in the north, which is so reliant on these major industrials, and has been for years. To have a minister who could not tell the House the last time he met with the major industrials on one day and then, on another day, denies the fact that transmission prices are going through the roof; it must be hard for those workers.

I understand they have not seen much of him lately, and I believe that is because he has not made many visits. We have, we will continue to, and I will be making another visit in the not-too-distant future to make sure that we are looking after their interests. I want to make it clear that Tasmanian Labor will do everything we can to support these workers, these jobs, and these businesses to get through a really tough time. We need to do everything we can from a transmission point of view, from a power price and from a wholesale price perspective to back them in.

I want to speak directly to the motion. I have talked about how important it is, and why this is worth the House's time, and I thank the House for allowing this debate to occur. It notes that on 2 April, in that statement that I read from, minister Duigan said, 'Our major industrials have faced nowhere near a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs.' He said it. He has had multiple occasions to say it is not true and has refused to do so. His Premier, his leader of government business, has had multiple opportunities to walk it back, to correct the record. Instead, they have doubled down and backed it in; something that is so obviously not true. It is not true to say that these businesses have faced nowhere near a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs. I know it because I have spoken to them. I know it because Ray Mostogl did an interview and said that prices have gone up by between 15 and 20 per cent. It was reported this morning.

I know it because the TCCI put out a statement this morning calling this for what it is, which is a huge issue for our major industrials and calling for us, the leaders of this state in this place, to do everything we can - to stand up for them, stand up for the jobs they support.

We have the minister saying that transmission prices have gone up by 'nowhere near 20 per cent', and we have the industry representative saying they have gone up by between 15 and 20 per cent. There it is. It is a pretty simple argument; the industry body that represents them saying they have gone up by 15 to 20 per cent, and the minister saying they have gone up by 'nowhere near 20 per cent.'

He did not tell the truth. He was given an opportunity to correct the record, and we would not be here if he just corrected the record this morning, or Tuesday, or Thursday - or if he had not said it in the first place. He is so arrogant in the way he stood up here and lectured others when he clearly did not understand the issue. The first time he answered questions about this, he talked about the wholesale price. He did not understand I was talking about the transmission price. He was answering the wrong question. Then he put out a statement to try and clarify things, and again, misled. This is the quote: 'Our major industrials have faced nowhere near a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs, as claimed by the opposition'.

To the other component of the motion: I want to speak about the question that was asked in point 4. The motion says:

Agrees the minister has misled the parliament in his answer to a question from Mrs Pentland on 9 April and failed to correct the record when given the opportunity.

I listened to Mrs Pentland's contribution and I understood what she was saying. I have also read the confidence and supply agreement she has with the government. My reading of that agreement is that she cannot support this motion. She has a confidence and supply agreement that says she cannot support this, which is unfortunate, but I am going to make the argument anyway because I think it speaks to a pattern of behaviour.

The minister was asked directly about when he was made aware of the transmission issue that was impacting electrical contractors and councils. I assume that was asked on the behalf of NECA (National Electrical and Communications Association) based on the question that was asked today. I am sure Mrs Pentland, doing the best she can for her constituency, wanted to get a real answer. Instead, the minister said he only became aware a couple of months ago. He became aware last year.

This morning, there is the test. Yesterday, maybe he made a mistake - and we all make mistakes. I have made mistakes. No one here is going to say they have never made a mistake. We all have. We have identified the mistake, and when I made that point of order I was inviting him to correct the record. In fact, I was encouraging that he might correct the record when I asked for your guidance about what a minister from the other place should or should not do. I thought you gave him a how-to guide as to how he should correct the record.

Clearly, his statement was wrong. It is in writing; NECA has provided the letter that says he has known about it for much longer. The appropriate response from the minister, if you are following from the Code of Conduct for Ministers, is to stand up and say, 'Sorry, I made a mistake, I got it wrong. I am correcting the record'. Instead, he doubled down. He did not say anything.

If you are looking for a pattern of behaviour, there it is. We have seen it all in the last two weeks. In six sitting days, we have identified it twice. The case is pretty clear. You have a serious issue that warrants the attention of the House - a really serious issue. Thousands of jobs, north and south - industries that have been with us for decades - under stress, under pressure, being overseen by a minister for energy who does not get it. He has been asked serious questions about his behaviour, about government policy, and he has denied the truth.

We do not have confidence in this minister because of his inaccurate statement, because of his misleading statement. He cannot possibly fix it now. This minister cannot step in and support them on transmission costs, because his public position is now that it is not true. He says real prices have gone down. Prices have gone up by up to 20 per cent in a single year but actually, as I said earlier, over the course of a number of years, once you compound the increases, they have gone up by much more. What are we going to do about it? The House has a choice to make: to set standards to adhere to the standing orders, or to adhere to the Code of Conduct for Ministers.
 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=6.7_D=5.0_C=0.69] 
The Premier's statement earlier today indicated that he is not going to hold his ministers to account [Bookmark: Phr3_O=12.6_D=4.8_C=0.78] . The Code of Conduct for ministers does not matter to him [Bookmark: Phr4_O=18.3_D=8.0_C=0.78]  because the political problem of dealing with a minister who does not tell the truth is more important to him than having ministers who adhere to his own code of conduct for ministers.
 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=27.5_D=6.8_C=0.83] It falls to the House again. Remember, it fell to the House with minister Ferguson [Bookmark: Phr6_O=35.7_D=6.4_C=0.75]  to do the job until the minister learned to count and realised the numbers were done [Bookmark: Phr7_O=43.7_D=9.3_C=0.72] . Here it falls to the House to do the Premier's job for him, to uphold the code of conduct for ministers and hold this minister to account [Bookmark: Phr8_O=54.1_D=3.1_C=0.90] .

Do we accept that we have a minister [Bookmark: Phr9_O=58.3_D=8.8_C=0.83]  who turns up here this morning and is invited to correct the record because there is documentary evidence of him having misled yesterday? [Bookmark: Phr10_O=69.1_D=3.0_C=0.83]  Do we accept when he just does not correct the record? [Bookmark: Phr11_O=73.2_D=24.3_C=0.81]  Do we accept that we have a minister who puts out statements that are categorically untrue and then refuses to accept that they are true, who is willing to bunker down and pretend it is not happening? I do not think we should.

I understand there is a confidence supply agreement in place for some members, but not for all. I hope that today members can see [Bookmark: Phr12_O=98.4_D=4.9_C=0.74]  that we need to hold this minister to account, on behalf of the government that will not and a Premier who will not. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=104.4_D=14.4_C=0.82]  Today's argument is important. It is important that we choose the side of business and a business community which has called this government out for [Bookmark: Phr14_O=120.8_D=9.9_C=0.78]  struggling to believe what they say. In this case the CEOs of both the Tasmanian Minerals, Manufacturing and Energy Council and the TCCI have outlined a serious pressure [Bookmark: Phr15_O=132.5_D=6.7_C=0.71] . Do you believe TMEC and the TCCI or do you believe minister Nick Duigan?  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=139.9_D=7.6_C=0.80] I believe the people to whom I spoke to. I believe the major industrials who I have been speaking to. I believe the statement from TMEC.

MOTION

Want of Confidence in Minister for Energy and Renewables

Continued from above.

[2.30 p.m.]
Mr WINTER - Deputy Speaker, this morning we heard the government with no argument as to why this motion should not be heard. We heard members of the crossbench say, 'Perhaps if you had offered me one, I might have voted for it', and yet we heard two completely different excuses, neither of which really related to the motion, so they lost and we have this debate. 

Over the break I have become aware of a letter that has been distributed, addressed to the minister, Mr Duigan, outlining - and I do not know if crossbenchers have been made aware of it - they have? I have not seen it directly. 

Mr Abetz - It sinks your boat. 

Mr WINTER - We are about to see, Leader of the House. It outlines from TasNetworks - a letter which seeks to undermine the arguments put forward by the major industrials and the arguments put forward by TMEC and the arguments that were put forward by the TCCI. 

The government of Tasmania has organised its GBE to come out and undermine the business community this afternoon. The business community earlier today called for a cap on the transmission price, or a pause on the increase in transmission prices. Presumably, the leader of business organised for that to be undermined. The TCCI called this a big moment for the government. Their approach was to undermine the people saying it. This is why the business community says to the government it will be difficult to ever trust them again. When the business community said they are facing huge hurdles, massive pressure, the government's reaction is not to own up, but to attack the messenger. A terrible approach. 

The letter says:

In real terms, 2024-25 network charges for all customers directly connected to the transmission network have decreased by 3.3 per cent over the past decade. 

Now, that was one of the arguments put by minister Abetz, which was irrelevant to the motion. The second point says:

In the 2024-25 and 2025-26 financial years, network charges for all MIs are increasing on average by 8.4 per cent in real terms. 

In real terms - looking forward into pricing using real terms. I am not sure who thought that was a good idea; perhaps the person spinning the numbers. I am not sure exactly how to turn that into nominal terms, because they are looking forward. Are they using the Treasury estimates? Why on earth would they use the real term? It is because someone is trying to spin the number to be lower than it is. We have never talked about real terms and neither has the industry.

If you put these numbers together over two years, plus inflation estimates - I think this is how they are calculating it, but it is difficult to tell because I have not seen people trying to use real terms going into the future before, but that is what they have done - it would increase to - get this - nearly 24 per cent. So here we go: the core argument in the motion is that you have the minister saying that prices have increased by nowhere near 20 per cent. The retort from the government through its GBE is actually that they have gone up by 24 per cent. That is their defence now.

Transmission prices, according to their own letter - if I have figured out their back-to-front maths correctly - have gone up nominally by about 24 per cent. You have a minister saying they have gone up nowhere near 20 per cent, and that is their defence. Prices have gone up by about 20 per cent according to the industry, according to the major industrials, and this government just announced that, in fact, over two years, they have gone up by 24 per cent, as their defence.

The motion is correct today. The motion in front of us is absolutely correct. Do you know how I know it is true? I spoke to the major industrials. I listened to Ray Mostogl. I noted what the TCCI said today. It is in the letter they presented as evidence. The minister said in his statement on 2 April, 'Our major industrials have faced nowhere near a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs.' Presented with the evidence in the parliament that that was wrong, he denied it. Now, presented with the evidence from TasNetworks in the parliament by his own government, I assume they are going to get up and say, that is wrong.

It is true prices have gone up by 20 per cent. According to the government's evidence, it is more. These businesses are really important. It is important that we have a minister who understands the issues and is prepared to be honest and accurate in this place. This parliament should and can present arguments, and put pressure on governments to do the right thing; but it is very hard when you have ministers who are not telling the truth. It is very hard when you have governments that are prepared to try and spin these numbers the way they have.

The minister himself said that price rises were nowhere near 20 per cent, and the evidence from the government is, in fact, they are. The motion is correct; not just by my evidence, not just by the evidence presented by major industrials, but by evidence presented by the government. I heard the arguments from the crossbench and the Greens earlier today seeking a bit more information. I am pleased to see that the government has provided that for you. It is exactly the argument that was needed for some to identify this minister has misled.

These issues, over the next few weeks potentially - it could be that short, but months and years - are going to be really important. The TCCI has called this a watershed moment for the government and they are looking carefully at how they respond to the challenge from the business community. The transmission prices are hurting them. They are putting so much pressure on jobs. The government's response was to curl up into a ball and try and spin a story this morning and this afternoon.

The arguments do not work. The arguments prove the point. They prove the motion to be correct. Minister Duigan stated on 2 April, 'Our major industrials have faced nowhere near a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs,' and the evidence provided by the government today is that that was not true. It was not true then. It is not true today. Ministers should not be allowed to make incorrect statements and not correct the record. Ministers should be held accountable and they should be up to the job. I have lost confidence in this minister. The truth is, I have been concerned about this for a long time. When I speak to major industrials, they are looking for someone who is on top of the job, who understands what is going on, and who is there when they need them. The evidence presented by the minister over the last week and a bit has been that he is not there when they need him. The evidence presented by the government is that they are prepared to undermine those businesses at their time of need, undermine their argument that they are hurting and they need support.

What is the best thing this Premier could do? What is the best thing this government could do? We should back them. We should back their call. This is a time of crisis for some of these businesses. You are looking at businesses that are up for sale. One has been sold. There is one whose parent company is in enormous strife. They are looking for every bit of support. They are not looking for letters that are leaked to the paper. They are looking for people in positions like ours who are there to support them and back them; not just with letters and words, but with real actions.

This morning I asked the government what they think about the proposal to pause the transmission price increases. By the way, earlier today this was commercial-in-confidence, by lunchtime it was fully able to be shared - the 2025-26 network charge for all MIs is increasing on average by 8.4 per cent. We do not know exactly how much it was last year because presumably that does not suit the argument. They have averaged it, so it is probably about 8.4 per cent. Is the government, in the face of major industrials being under enormous pressure, going to listen to the major industrials in their pleas, and to the TCCI, and back them in and support them on transmission pricing and pause those increases, or are they just going to keep jacking the prices up and put them under more pressure?

This is as clear-cut as I can make it. The minister was asked time and time again about this answer. Time and time again he has refused to tell the truth. The Premier should hold him to account. We know he will not, and so it is up to the House to make a decision about the standards that we set for this place. He may come from the other place, but he needs to be held to our standard. Do we believe that ministers should be able to come in here and say whatever they want, make things up and tell lies, or are we going to hold them to account? I hope that the House today will hold this minister to account.

[2.40 p.m.]
Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) - Honourable Speaker, it appears that the Leader of the Opposition has run out of puff over the lunch break, unfortunately. The member talks about backing people in. Yesterday was clear evidence that the member does not back Tasmania in when it comes to negotiations with the federal government over road and bridge funding -

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - unlike other Labor premiers across the country who back in their states.

A member - Be relevant.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Members on my left will be silent. The opposition leader was heard in silence.

Mr ROCKLIFF - On this side of the House we have absolute confidence in our minister, Mr Duigan. He is doing a fantastic job under difficult circumstances. He is leading our renewable energy agenda. It is a fantastic agenda. What we have had today from the Leader of the Opposition is a distraction from the worst couple of weeks I have seen, even worse than the last couple of weeks before, in March. It is getting worse and worse for the Leader of the Opposition, I have to say.

We have a very clear energy agenda. As our state grows and as our energy demand grows, the government knows more energy generation is absolutely needed. It was our government that legislated the Tasmanian Renewable Energy Target, to double on-island renewable energy generation by 2040, setting a very clear foundation for what needs to be done. It was our government that put in train the Tasmanian Renewable Energy Action Plan. Our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future commits to a Tasmania first energy policy to create the energy Tasmania needs for our future while keeping power prices as low as possible for Tasmanians.

You can see the contrast between Labor's so-called energy agenda at the last election and what they actually did between 2010 and 2014, where households faced 65 per cent increases in power prices. There is a clear contrast there. We, on the other hand, are delivering lowest possible energy prices, an outcome that continues to be confirmed by the independent regulator, with Tasmania having the lowest regulated prices in the nation. I commend our Minister for Energy and Renewables, Mr Duigan, for his leadership in this area.

We have reissued ministerial expectations to our energy businesses, reinforcing a focus on lowest possible prices and supporting our economy, continuing the momentum for our economy - an economy that has delivered consistently low unemployment over the course of the last number of years. When we came to government, the unemployment level had an eight in front of it - eight point something - and we have halved that through good, strong economic management in difficult times, including energy volatility not just in this country but across the globe.

At the same time, we have been providing cost-of-living relief through measures such as our supercharged Renewable Energy Dividend and some of the most generous concessions in the nation. We have been supporting Tasmanians through difficult times and through that energy volatility, whether that be the Renewable Energy Dividend or whether that be working in partnership with the federal government in supporting that considerable investment where we credit our customers' power bills. We have been taking people with us on the journey of energy volatility by not only providing credits to people's power bills but also ensuring we have the lowest regulated energy prices in the nation, and that is some feat.

We know that more needs to be done to bring on new generation. We are not shying away from that and nor is our Energy minister. In terms of bringing on new generation, we are investing in maintenance and improvements to our Hydro fleet, supporting the growth of wind and solar farms in our state and building the transmission networks that we need. The investment that Hydro is making in Tarraleah is extraordinary, and I implore members of all parties to go and be briefed on that significant investment at Tarraleah and other upgrades to turbines and energy and infrastructure on the west coast. It is something we need to be extremely proud of that is setting us up for the future, with Marinus coming along the line as well.

If I turn to major industrials, through Hydro our government has a long history of providing support to our MIs through affordable, renewable energy. We know that our energy has been a key driver in bringing major industrials to Tasmania and keeping them here, which is why it is crucial that we work alongside our major industrials, which we have been doing. We secured a 10-year agreement with Liberty Bell Bay late last year, if my memory serves me correctly, which is a great example of what can be done when people sit down and work through these challenges, which we are doing.

We expect Hydro to continue to work with our major industrials on their wholesale energy needs, and supporting our economy is a key part of Hydro Tasmania's new charter. Bringing on new generation is critical to continuing to ensure that our major industrials have an abundant source of wholesale energy. That is why we are continuing to progress Marinus Link, which is the linchpin of delivering our renewable energy targets and critical for major investment in wind and solar. 

We have been on board with this for many years. It probably goes back to 2017, if my memory serves me correctly, and the former Energy minister around that time. I know the Coalition government and the Liberal government were working together, and the Labor federal government and the Liberal Tasmanian government were working together there. How do I know that? We signed that first agreement with Prime Minister Albanese a few years ago. Through all that time we had the Labor opposition still unsure about which side of the fence they will sit on -

Mr Winter - You voted against Marinus yesterday.

Mr ROCKLIFF - still unsure what they should do, and unsure of whether or not they should be backing in more renewable energy investment, wind and solar, and backing in Tasmania.

Mr Winter - How did you go with ACEN yesterday?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Sitting on the fence, constantly. Even silly enough to not sit on the fence yesterday but make a decision to do over Tasmania, which other states will benefit from. I find it absolutely extraordinary. It is one of the worst policy decisions I have ever seen a party take in this place.

Mr Winter - Since your GST deal?

Ms Brown - I find it extraordinary you are not talking about the motion.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left, the Leader of the Opposition was heard in silence.

Mr ROCKLIFF – It is the worst decision I have seen a political party take, because it was anti-Tasmania and anti-Tasmanian. As I said this morning, notwithstanding the Greens' position on roads and bridges and bitumen and things with wheels - and we know they are anti-roads and anti-bridges and anti-gravel and anti-anything to do with road transport - they still stood on the side of the Chamber that stood up for Tasmania.

There was a very lonely group of people over there when the majority of the parliament made a very clear decision to support minister Ferguson's motion. All you could do through that debate was play politics, but at the end of the day, you were found out because you are reading the talking points of national Labor Party headquarters, the people who administer you.

Ms BROWN - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 142. This does not have any relevance to the motion that we are debating.

The SPEAKER - Standing Order 142 says that the contributions have to be relevant to the subject matter. I am not reading from it at the moment, but that is roughly what it says. I will call the Premier to be relevant to the motion before the House, which is the confidence motion in his minister.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, I will return to energy policy.

Ms Brown - No, the motion.

The SPEAKER - I have just said that, so I think we can let the Premier be heard in silence.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We all remember the energy hoaxes that were Labor party policy at the last election. How embarrassing, honestly. Labor's first hoax was to gut Hydro and set up the 'Tasmanian Power Co', which would be a costly new government business we do not need and cannot afford, resulting in higher power prices. Within just one day, Labor had backed away from it. It had vanished from their policy documents completely. The architect of that, as I understand it, was Mr Winter, because he was the energy spokesperson. Is that right, back then?

Mr Winter - I am just waiting for you to maybe defend your minister.

The SPEAKER - The Premier will cease trying to get interjections. Members on my left will stop interjecting. Members on my right will also stop interjecting. The Premier has the call.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The second hoax was related to power prices - despite making it a flagship policy on day one of the election campaign, they failed to submit that policy for costing to Treasury. They were too busy issuing Facebook photos of policies and commitments and money going out the door on the run - I would have to say in desperation, even 12 hours before election day - and they failed to do their job as an opposition when it comes to submitting costing to Treasury.

Ms Brown - When are you going to do your job and defend your minister? It is embarrassing that you cannot defend your minister.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The shadow treasurer at the time had to have two or three media conferences to get it right in some shape or form at the end of the day, embarrassingly. Why did they not submit their energy costings to Treasury? It was because it did not add up. That is why.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - They were promising 400 new subsidies to the bills of 289,000 residential and small business customers, which would not have been a one-off cost of $50 million as Labor have claimed. It would have cost more than double that, in actual fact, and have blown a half a billion-dollar hole in the budget. That is energy hoax no. 2. It was a hoax and a failure and remains totally uncosted.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left. I am going to stop everyone. The House has suspended Standing Orders for a very serious matter and I expect that everyone in this House would be debating [Bookmark: Phr2_O=26.8_D=4.7_C=0.59]  this matter, making their case on either side, and listening respectfully to it. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=32.1_D=2.0_C=0.79]  This is a really serious thing. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=35.3_D=7.7_C=0.81]  I ask everyone to be relevant in their contributions and I would ask for interjections to cease. 

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=45.0_D=20.6_C=0.76] Labor's third hoax, when it comes to energy, was their position on Marinus Link. They claimed they would walk away from the deal. They said it was throwing good money after bad. Then when it came to the crunch, they flip-flopped again, just like other policy positions they have flipped on. Why this is relevant to this motion [Bookmark: Phr6_O=66.7_D=25.4_C=0.74]  is because, we have the flip-flop over there, and the energy hoax creators over there. This is in contrast to a minister, minister Duigan, who is doing his job to ensure we have energy security for Tasmania at the lowest possible prices to households and major industrials.
 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=93.3_D=3.9_C=0.72] 
Labor's fourth hoax [Bookmark: Phr8_O=98.2_D=14.4_C=0.72]  was their announcement to scrap fees for electricity connections and disconnections when people move house. What Labor failed to mention was that the fees related to basic meters. We had moved on from that with the fast-track of advanced met [Bookmark: Phr9_O=112.7_D=8.6_C=0.84] ers.

Their last hoax was their promise to provide rebates for contracted customers, with Mr Winter revealing he did not even know how much this would cost. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=123.0_D=4.4_C=0.83]  The former shadow energy minister had one job at the last election, [Bookmark: Phr11_O=127.8_D=12.7_C=0.81]  and he failed on all of them. You got it very wrong. It is why we should not trust you on anything to do with energy. You are constantly trying to walk both sides of the street on energy. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=142.2_D=15.0_C=0.76]  It is reminiscent of the 2024 election, when Labor's energy policy could not even survive two sleeps. It was one of the most embarrassing things I have seen in the history of this parliament.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=158.8_D=20.0_C=0.82] The energy regulator regulates transmission costs to all customers to ensure they are prudent and efficient. By calling on all transmission in the state to be built immediately, regardless of location or need [Bookmark: Phr14_O=179.9_D=25.9_C=0.74] , Labor would add hundreds of millions of dollars to the cost base of our major industrials, which is irresponsible. They continue their irresponsible policies irrespective of the policy or portfolio. We have spoken about infrastructure, and energy is a classic example. 

We will continue [Bookmark: Phr15_O=206.2_D=3.1_C=0.60]  to progress Marinus Link and the North West Transmission Development [Bookmark: Phr16_O=209.9_D=4.7_C=0.74] s in parallel, with the focus now on the first Marinus cable [Bookmark: Phr17_O=216.5_D=0.9_C=0.77]  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=219.2_D=26.4_C=0.85] . Labor cannot be trusted. Labor's plan would ruin the major industrials. That is why I back in our minister. He has been fighting the good fight in volatile times for energy, along with all ministers and members of our government [Bookmark: Phr19_O=245.6_D=4.7_C=0.80] , to ensure that consumers have the lowest possible impact when it comes to cost of living [Bookmark: Phr20_O=250.8_D=15.6_C=0.80]  and energy; when it comes to renewable energy dividends; when it comes to supporting credits on power bills; when it comes to supporting those organisations that support vulnerable Tasmanians: we have backed that in consistently over the last three years.

 [Bookmark: Phr21_O=267.1_D=24.5_C=0.70] Mr Winter needs to correct the record. It is Mr Winter who has misled this House. He refers to a letter minister Duigan received from TasNetworks that states that when compared to the prior year [Bookmark: Phr22_O=291.9_D=4.1_C=0.46] , the four MIs faced a 13.9 per cent increase in nominal terms [Bookmark: Phr23_O=296.6_D=8.4_C=0.79]  for 2024-25, which is 9.5 per cent in real terms. In 2025-26 they will face a 10.6 per cent increase in nominal terms, which is 7.9 per cent in real terms. Can I say -

The SPEAKER - I am hearing a point of order.

Ms FINLAY - He needs to table it.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - People can seek leave to have those documents tabled. You can ask the minister to table a document if he is reading from it. If the Premier is just quoting from it, then not so much. This is a really important thing and I think that while there are two groups in this House that have very firm ideas on how they are voting today, I imagine people listening are waiting to be convinced either way on the merit of everyone's argument. Take it seriously in this House, all of you. The Premier has the call. You may request that he table a document from which he is reading, but if he is only quoting it then he can choose not to do so. The Premier has the call unless the member wishes to make a point of order.

Ms FINLAY - Speaker, the Premier has a letter in his hand that he is reading from. May I ask that he tables the letter, please? 

The SPEAKER - You may ask the Premier. Are you reading from a document that you wish to table?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Absolutely.

The SPEAKER - The Premier does not need to seek leave. The Premier can table a document at any stage. We can do that now if you like. When you finish reading from it you can hand it to the clerk.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I can read the letter, if you like.

Dear Minister, 

Re costs for directly connected transmission customers. 

It is my understanding that representatives for the four major industrial businesses, MIs, in Tasmania have been making sustained claims that directly connected transmission customers have had increases to their energy supply costs by 20 per cent in this financial year. I am writing to confirm this is not the case, with no customers directly connected to the transmission network, including the four MIs, experiencing such an increase in the real terms in 2024-25. 

Network charges for all customers directly connected to the transmission network have decreased 3.3 per cent over the past decade. When compared to the prior year, the four MIs, Bell Bay Aluminum, Liberty, Nyrstar and Gorski on average faced a 13.9 per cent increase in nominal terms for 2024-25, 9.5 per cent real, and in 2025-26 they will face 10.6 per cent increase in nominal terms, 7.9 per cent real in line with the Australian Energy Regulators determination from 2024. 

I enclose for your consideration indicative average transmission charges as published by the AER in their final decision for the 2024-29 revenue period. TasNetworks has a strong and active relationship with major industries in Tasmania and we work closely with these integral businesses to help protect their financial wellbeing. We encourage any of the businesses mentioned today by the Tasmanian Minerals Manufacturing Energy Council to reach out to TasNetworks directly if they are seeking additional support. 

There you have it, Mr Winter. I will repeat from that letter, 

'I am writing to confirm that this is not the case.' 

I table that. Thank you very much.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The interjections will cease. Another point of order?

Mr ROCKLIFF - I will back in - 

Ms FINLAY As I was able to request that the Premier table the letter, which he has done, thankfully, could I ask the Premier to indicate what time he received the letter? 

The SPEAKER - No, you may not ask the Premier to do that. You may make a contribution of your own in a moment. The Premier has the call.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Minister Duigan is a fantastic minister. He deserves the House's support. These are challenging times in a volatile electricity market. He has the confidence of all our members on this side of the Chamber and always will.

[3.02 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to talk to this no-confidence motion. As promised in the earlier debates, we have listened really hard, considered this issue really deeply and discussed it with our team. We acknowledge that there are plenty of questions here. There were plenty of questions asked in Question Time today and we acknowledge that the answers were not straight. The minister for Energy has gained a reputation for being tricky, evasive, and for not being straight. As I said in my earlier contribution, Ms Badger has found him equally evasive as Minister for Parks; evasive, defensive, arrogant, and ultimately not always acting in the public interest and also raising questions about our competence. The question here today is: has he actually lied to this House?

We are talking about the opaque nature of power contracts here. We are arguing about - and it seems we have got several different letters now - what are the major industrials, what are their contracts and what are their transmission costs? This goes to the point and the issue of a lack of transparency of these contracts.

Commercial-in-confidence is too often hidden behind as a barrier to deny the public information and transparency about the decisions that this government and its agencies are making on behalf of the people with, in this case, major industrials. It is a barrier to transparency. It is a barrier to truth. It is a barrier to clarity. It challenges accountability and makes it hard for us to hold this minister to account, because there is no ability for us - let alone the public - to properly understand the power price issues and the advantages that the major industrials get in relation to the rest of us.

Part of what we are talking about here is the complexity of the power-pricing system and the absolute, opaque nature of the contracts that these major industrials have with suppliers and TasNetworks and others. We have listened hard to the debate. We supported the suspension of standing orders because we always do, and this is an important debate to have. We supported urgency because there is no motion that is more important than a no-confidence motion. It is a significant issue. 

We agree in many ways with the government here, that Labor has underwhelmed when it comes to the case that has been made. We think the case has not been made particularly well. I think Mr O'Byrne and others have made that point in the earlier debates. Similarly, we do not necessarily agree that the Liberal members have done a good job of defending their minister and making the case that no, he has not misled here. There are genuine questions here that need to be answered. There are genuine questions in a number of his portfolios, as I mentioned, but I ask the question: is that enough to hang him on? Is that enough to hang him on with a no-confidence motion that has serious ramifications?

Since the 7 o'clock news this morning, we have thought that this kind of motion may have been on the cards. Then, of course, listening to the questions the Leader of the Opposition and others asked this morning, it became more and more obvious that this is the direction that it was going, but we have listened really hard. We have listened to the debate. We have looked at the media reports. We have now just quickly looked at one of the versions of the TasNetworks letters. We did not get either of those letters, mind you, but I have to say that certainly the one that I got from Ms Finlay - I do not know that it necessarily demonstrates the power transmission prices have gone up by 25 per cent. I do not know that you unpacked that necessarily all that well. It seems that now the premier has got a separate letter that, as I am on my feet here, I have not actually seen.

We have looked at the media reports and the media releases. I will make the point, unlike what I heard Dr Broad say in his earlier contribution, I do not see the TCCI saying the power transmission costs to major industrials have gone up by 20 per cent. They make a case for the major industrials. Of course they do, they are a business representative but they are saying that the pressures are increasing and that the government needs to do all it can to rein in pressures. That media release does not back up the Labor opposition's case that the prices have gone up by 20 per cent. Ray Mostogl from TMEC is reported 15 to 20 per cent. Like I said before, the TasNetworks letter does not seem to indicate that 25 per cent increase as claimed by the Leader of the Opposition.

While there are genuine questions here, we think that the case has not been made here. The case for no-confidence in this minister has not necessarily been made. It is a really serious motion to pass and we do not take that lightly. We have moved no-confidence in the past. We did not get it up. The Labor opposition did not support that in the context of a previous no-confidence motion and we do not take it lightly. We stand here today considering this deeply; not least because of the issues for this House and what it means for the House and the principles, but for the minister as well. This has serious personal and professional ramifications for a minister and we cannot let that go unsaid. Collectively we decide about the future of the minister and that needs to weigh heavily on our minds. That is something incredibly serious. We do not think the case has been made for no-confidence.

We believe there is definitely a case here for a referral of some description. If there was a forum that we could refer this minister to where we could hear the evidence, we could interrogate the minister, you could interrogate the major industrials, you could interrogate TasNetworks potentially, in camera, to manage that commercial-in-confidence issue, then that is something that we would entertain. However, we understand that it is not within the power of this House to refer this minister to privileges, because he does not reside in this place. He is given permission to come down here and answer questions, but he cannot be referred to privileges through this House.

While we will not support the no-confidence motion. It does present an opportunity for the Labor Party to use its members in the other place to refer him to a similar forum to interrogate some of those issues. I assume that they have asked some of these issues of the minister themselves in the other place. I assume they have received the same kind of evasive and opaque answers in that other place. There is the space to make this case in the other place.
We do not believe the case for no-confidence has been made. The Liberal Party has not necessarily done a great job of defending their minister, but that does not necessarily mean that we are going to fall on the side of no-confidence in this place. 

I want to leave some space for one of our other members to speak, should they choose. I want to remind this House for future debates: we are going to be debating, at length, energy pricing, energy policy, and energy investments, particularly with Marinus Link. I mentioned this in my earlier contribution, but as we go into that place, particularly the Labor opposition, I ask you to remember this debate. We are arguing over a 20 per cent increase to major industrials of transmission pricing.

Like I said, Grange Resources are not a major industrial, they are not one of the four, but they are a major industry. They are a significant mine in the north-west of Tasmania. They have made a public submission to a committee of this House, a joint committee in fact, that makes it really clear that Marinus presents a significant problem for them. They say:

Marinus will also significantly increase distribution costs for end users in Tasmania. Grange has been informed by TasNetworks that our transmission costs will increase by 29.6 per cent.

I leave you with that thought. I hope that, in the future debates about Marinus and about the implications of Marinus, the Labor opposition and the Liberal government reflect on this debate and the significant amount of concern about a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs. I hope they recognise that, as at the information that Grange has, Marinus Link will increase their transmission costs by 29.6 per cent.

I reiterate that we have engaged in this openly and honestly, and we have listened carefully. We are no fans of this minister in either of his portfolios, but we do not believe the case for no-confidence has been made. We believe there is a case for some referral to some kind of body so that questions can be answered, but that is not a power that is open to this House.

[3.12 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, it seems that not only has the Leader of the Opposition run out of puff, but the whole opposition as well, with nobody jumping. I was taught very early on in life that the person who asserts must prove. No proof has been offered up by the Leader of the Opposition in support of his no-confidence motion. What he has sought to do is to repeat and repeat and repeat that the minister misled. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, although I think he has a closed mind, so allow me to seek to address the crossbench, because they might be open minded to some rational argument: mere repetition of a proposition does not obviate the need for evidence [Bookmark: Phr2_O=28.8_D=2.3_C=0.69]  and proof, and none has been offered. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.6_D=17.4_C=0.79]  If proof is required, minister Duigan is entitled to rely on the information provided to him by TasNetworks and the letter that the Premier tabled is very clear.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ABETZ -  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=51.6_D=2.0_C=0.88]  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=55.1_D=1.9_C=0.74]  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=59.3_D=1.0_C=0.23]  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=61.9_D=24.6_C=0.82] I quote:

It is my understanding that representatives have made claims that there were increases to the energy supply cost by 20 per cent in this financial year. I am writing to confirm this is not the case; with no customers directly connected to the transmission network, including the four major industrials, experiencing such an increase.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=87.3_D=0.9_C=0.45] Case shut. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=90.4_D=5.9_C=0.90]  No longer any support. This is what the minister has been saying all along. This is what [Bookmark: Phr10_O=97.6_D=5.2_C=0.72]  TasNetworks is saying in a written correspondence to the minister [Bookmark: Phr11_O=103.9_D=18.9_C=0.81] , and yet the Labor Party would seek to make the assertion that somehow he has misled the parliament. If that is the case, which I reject, but if that is the case, then it means TasNetworks has misled the minister and that case clearly has not been made out.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=124.0_D=20.8_C=0.80] What is more important is that further down in the letter, TasNetworks tell us:

I enclose for your consideration indicative average transmission charges as published by the AER in their final decision for the 2024-2029 revenue period.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=145.6_D=23.9_C=0.75] Did you hear the Leader of the Opposition refer to that in any way, shape or form? No, it was crickets on that one. While I am not allowed to show something, can I indicate that attached to that was a graph indicating a reduction and stabilisation [Bookmark: Phr14_O=170.6_D=4.1_C=0.69]  of prices.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ABETZ -  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=175.8_D=18.3_C=0.75] In relation to the motion that is before us, the Leader of the Opposition has already been dealt a death blow with the purported quotation of Mrs Pentland in paragraph (4) being rejected by her, so the wheels are well and truly falling off the motion. In paragraph (2)(b) [Bookmark: Phr16_O=196.4_D=19.1_C=0.85] , the Leader of the Opposition is trying to construct an argument by quoting the CEO of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to say there is a question mark over the viability of many of Tasmania's major industrials and due to an increase in transmission costs.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=218.4_D=26.2_C=0.81] What about the cost of ore, the cost of the commodity after it has been produced, the way that China has been perverting the international market, and so the list goes on? That has all been airbrushed away by the Leader of the Opposition in a mischievous attempt to try to make out an argument that minister Duigan has m [Bookmark: Phr18_O=245.6_D=0.9_C=0.75] isled this place. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=248.1_D=29.4_C=0.79]  What we have here is a 'He said; she said,' type debate where somebody said, 'nowhere near 20 per cent', somebody else said 'almost 20 per cent', 'by as much as 20 per cent'. 

You have all these different versions. Would you convict anybody of a traffic offence on that evidence? Absolutely not. Would you seek to condemn a minister and say that this [Bookmark: Phr20_O=277.8_D=25.4_C=0.84]  House has no confidence on the basis of that evidence? No, nobody would do that and that is why I must say it was heartening to hear the Deputy Leader of the Greens make his contribution and provide an indication of the analysis undertaken by the Greens in relation to this motion. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=303.4_D=0.6_C=0.65] 

Let us be very clear: the question asked by Mr Winter - and this is where it is very mischievous - when Mr Winter tries to add two years together to try to get somewhere near the 20 per cent. This is the question that Mr Winter actually asked:
Can you confirm that your government increased energy transmission costs across our four major industrials by nearly 20 per cent this financial year and is set to increase them by more than 10 per cent this coming year?'

His figure of 20 per cent was for this financial year. The letter that he sought to quote from and then got the figures wrong is over a two-year period. If this matter were to go to a jury, the jury would be coming back in five minutes, flat saying, 'Not guilty, your Honour.' The evidence is clearly not there for the claims made by the Leader of the Opposition. He clearly ran out of puff before lunchtime, then after lunch he left off where he was, that is, without any energy or conviction because he knew his claims would fail, as they must fail for the lack of evidence.

I would like to go on at some length on this but we have an agreement around the Chamber. I note that the Premier spoke a bit longer than the 15 minutes and so I will cut my comments at this stage, but the House should be assured it is not because of lack of content. There was a lot more I could have contributed.

[3.20 p.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise this afternoon to back the position of Tasmania Labor in questioning the integrity of this minister. There is no doubt that this place should have no confidence in this minister because repeatedly, in this place and outside this place, he has misled the Tasmanian people about what the reality is for the impacts on our major industrials.

One of the things that I thought someone on the other side was going to say, but they came short of saying, which is one of the things that I have always believed strongly in life - the standard that you walk past is the standard you accept. In this place, there is no question that the standard of behaviours and the standard of integrity of the ministers in this place, particularly of the minister who we are talking about today, has dropped to the point where a minister believes that they can come into this place and provide information that is not correct to the Tasmanian people through a media release, and then not correct the record when that is brought to their attention.

There is no portfolio that is of equal importance to the Energy portfolio, responsible for a sector that employs thousands of Tasmanians. It deserves a minister who takes their responsibility seriously, who understands the implications of the policies that they implement and furthermore, is actually connected and has a trusted relationship with the people they represent. The minister needs to understand the impacts of their decisions and the true reality of the circumstances that they face.

Today we have had the CEO of TMEC, Ray Mostogl, say on the record that our major industrials in Tasmania have faced transmission cost increases of up to 20 per cent. We have the CEO of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who regularly meets with our major industrials in Tasmania, say that our major industrials have had increases in their transmission. We have extraordinarily, today, seen documents released by TasNetworks or an exchange with TasNetworks around the position of transmission costs in Tasmania. I say extraordinary because I faced the media just moments ago, and the media asked me some questions from a letter that was issued by TasNetworks. I did not quite understand where the media was going, because they asked, 'How many major industrials are there in Tasmania?' I thought, 'Wow, that is a funny question' and said 'There are four'.

There are four major industrials in Tasmania, and those four major industrials are under intense pressure - yes, from global circumstances, but also from the increase in their power contracts with the Tasmanian government and the increases in their transmission costs. The letter, which we thought we were reading along with the Premier - this government is in such a mess and are so caught out that, in trying desperately not to be in a position where they have to defend this minister, they are talking about anything and everything else. They have evidence from other places in order not to actually stand and defend their minister, because they know it is an indefensible position. 

I am reading along in the letter, then the Premier starts using other words. This says here, 'I'm writing to confirm … with none of TasNetwork's 12 major industrials'. Twelve major industrials? Were they at the time trying to shandy up the figures to protect this minister from the reality of his misinformation? There have never been 12 major industrials in Tasmania. There are also different figures in the letters, so what happened? 

Earlier this morning, there was a letter released from TasNetworks to Nicholas Duigan on 10 April. I would love to know the time stamping of this letter. The government did not much like that, did not like the fact that it messed up and created less certainty for the defence of the minister than they perhaps would have otherwise liked, so they went back to TasNetworks and said, 'You know what, would you consider rewriting that for us because it does not really suit our purposes and does not really help us defend our minister. Could you reissue it?'

Then there is this spanking new letter that has been tabled this afternoon - clearly a different letter issued at a different time. I would love the timestamp on this letter. They know they made a mistake by attempting to deny that the four major industrials have had significant increases in their transmission prices, but if you add in another eight, then that will shandy it down. They knew that was the mistake they made, because in the first sentence it says, 'It is my understanding that representatives for major industrial businesses, MIs, in Tasmania,'. The other letter says, 'It is my understanding that representatives of the four major industrial businesses in Tasmania', clearly intentionally, or perhaps by mistake, but what any good organisation or entity or individual would do immediately when they understood they had made a mistake is they would correct the record, and they would apologise. 

This minister, from 2 April, when he said that our major industrials have faced nowhere near a 20 per cent increase in their transmission prices, has not once sought to correct the record. He has danced around the issue repeatedly when given the opportunity. He was actually invited to correct the record in this place.

I understand the importance for the crossbench and for the Greens to have concrete information about the one issue that we are seeking for this minister to correct: the statement that he made on 2 April, where he said that no major industrials in Tasmania have had anywhere close to a 20 per cent increase in their transmission costs. 

He made that statement. Since then, he has referred to that statement in multiple different ways and has danced around it. The government has today had the opportunity to defend him on that particular matter, which is the core centre for this motion, and we have people standing up talking about all sorts of issues - about roads, about forestry, about all sorts of different things. The Premier's opening statement, when he stood up and had the opportunity to defend his minister, came down to a personal attack. 
When anybody in life, in any circumstance, is under pressure and they know they did the wrong thing, if they are not willing to be credible and say, 'You know what, sorry, I made a mistake' - we have actually seen situations in recent times in this parliament where a minister makes a mistake, and within moments goes, 'You know what, I made a mistake.'

Former minister Street is the classic example of this. He attends the House, he says he has made a mistake, he corrects the record, and it all goes away. However, since 2 April, this government have been dancing around this issue to the point that it has become the evidence to know that he has made a mistake. We have two pieces of correspondence from one of our GBEs saying different things with different figures around the same issue, trying to protect a minister. Clearly there has been an intervention by the government on this. Clearly it did not suit their purposes. Clearly they are in such a mess that they needed to have something different. Mathematically, if you -

Mr Winter - Could you seek to table that letter?

Ms FINLAY - I will. Has it got a time on it? 

Mr Winter - No.

Ms FINLAY - No, okay. I am going to table the first letter. 

The SPEAKER - You cannot table; you can seek leave to table. 

Ms FINLAY - Thank you. May I please seek leave?

The SPEAKER - You are seeking leave to table? 

Ms FINLAY - May I seek leave to table the letter?

The SPEAKER - My apologies, I should have clarified. You need to explain what it is, and the general courtesy is that you show the letter to other members of the parliament. You still have some time. I might allow the minister time to read that before we put the motion. We will withdraw that motion and deal with it in a moment. 

Ms FINLAY - Can I keep talking, though?

The SPEAKER - I do not think I could stop you, Ms Finlay.

Ms FINLAY - It is clear that when there are, on the same day, dated at the same time, sent to the same person, two versions of the same letter formatted completely differently with different information in them, there is something wrong. There is absolutely something wrong, and this minister is absolutely under pressure. The government is under pressure and the Premier is under pressure trying to protect and defend the indefensible. 

It is clear that someone could have stood up and said, 'Actually, you know what, it wasn't this; it was that', but they have not even provided the counter argument.

Minister Abetz, the Leader of the House, stood up and said it is for the accuser to provide the evidence. We have in concrete from the TMEC, and there is no peak body voice stronger than TMEC for our major industrials. They have put it on the record. They have said that there have been increases to our major industrials by up to 20 per cent and, further, TMEC have said that it is the largest increase in more than a decade and it is so serious that there should be an intervention from this government. Then the TCCI have come out and made a statement. 

Someone this morning said that this minister is the best minister because we have great energy security in Tasmania. Well, the TCCI today has said there is an 'energy crisis' - this is today, 10 April. It is one issue: not reissued with any different words. There is an energy crisis that the Tasmanian government needs to address and there have been increases in the transmission costs.

The evidence that is required by this place to support the no-confidence motion in this minister is that we have people who work with and represent the major industrials in Tasmania  stating as a matter of fact on the record that transmission costs have gone up by a measure of 20 per cent. It is on the record. The maths - and I was about to talk about this -

Mr Abetz - Your leave is granted.

The SPEAKER - We will put the motion again. The question for the House is -

That leave the granted to table the document.

Leave granted.

Ms FINLAY - Thank you. The second version of the letter talks about an average faced by our four major industrials, and actually, mathematically, if you cut what they have got, their 13.9 per cent, one of them has to be close to 20 per cent. There is the evidence in there, mathematically.

Mr Abetz - No, over two years.

Ms FINLAY - No, Minister Abetz. I will read from the second letter that you attempted to have written for you to back your position. It says:

When compared to the prior year, the four MIs - Bell Bay Aluminium, Liberty, Nyrstar and Norske - on average faced a 13.9 per cent increase in nominal terms for the 2024-25 year.

Mr Abetz - Nominal terms. 

Ms FINLAY - Yes.

Mr Winter - That is what we were always talking about.

Ms FINLAY - It is your minister who is talking about real terms.

The SPEAKER - Through the Chair, please.

Ms FINLAY - Four major industrials faced with an average of 13.9 per cent in one year - the 2024-25 year - mathematically, one of them has to be close to 20 per cent. That, in fact, is your evidence to say that this minister has knowingly not corrected the record when he has made a mistake. 

The Tasmanian people expect a minister who does the right thing and tells the truth. Tasmanian business and industry need to expect that their energy minister does the right thing and tells the truth. There is no confidence from this side of the House in this minister. He has knowingly misled the Tasmanian people and the Tasmanian parliament and he should be held to account.

[3.31p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I get up to provide my contribution to the no-confidence motion in the minister. At times in this House we can descend into a bit of an inside ball game of how we can get - I will not say one-upmanship - but how we can score points on each other. Sometimes the issues that are more important get lost between the battle of personalities and the argy-bargy across the House.

At the end of the day, the major industrials are very important. They employ directly and indirectly thousands of Tasmanians and have done over many years. Their energy prices and their negotiations over many cycles have been predominantly confidential between those major industrials and our government business enterprises, and there is always flexing of muscles on both sides about what is the most appropriate price point.

I do not know how many times I have read in newspapers around the state over the last 
20 years accusing the major industrials of not paying [Bookmark: Phr2_O=11.0_D=28.7_C=0.79]  a fair price for their energy,  and that effectively that we are giving it. We all know the history of how we attracted major industrials to Tasmania to establish. It was given that we had an advantage in terms of our energy, not only clean at the time, that has become more important, but that we could provide them with cheap energy so that they could establish their businesses here. 

The global economy and the nature of these businesses have changed over time [Bookmark: Phr3_O=40.5_D=26.2_C=0.79]  but at the end of the day, energy has always been a key determinant in terms of their presence in Tasmania. I recall being economic development minister at the time when the Australian dollar was pushing towards $1.10; the London metals price had the bottom falling out of it. I had meetings on a monthly basis in my ministerial office with the major industrials all saying that they were about to pack up because [Bookmark: Phr4_O=67.6_D=5.7_C=0.68]  of the nature of the market they were in and the fact that they were not getting a good rate on energy. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=73.6_D=28.3_C=0.81]  I do not disregard that. They were genuine discussions. They were genuine motivations from the major industrials to get a good price so they could maintain their presence in Tasmania. That should always be something that we are conscious of. 

We need to remember that when we get into these parliamentary fights around confidence or censure or misleading [Bookmark: Phr6_O=103.1_D=0.6_C=0.82] , we have [Bookmark: Phr7_O=104.0_D=25.4_C=0.78]  thousands of families who are being dragged into these kinds of debates. We need to be mindful and respectful. 

I respect the advocacy of Labor as an opposition, given their discussions with the major industrials, and they feel you have made the decision to become activists for the major industrials in this matter. I respect that. It is the role of opposition [Bookmark: Phr8_O=130.3_D=3.4_C=0.69]  to raise these issues and to hold the government to account [Bookmark: Phr9_O=134.0_D=14.5_C=0.74] . I respect Ray Mostogl. He is a fine Tasmanian. He has made a significant contribution, not only when he came down here as a CEO at Rio Tinto [Bookmark: Phr10_O=149.1_D=15.9_C=0.84] , but also in his role now currently with the minerals council and, of course, Mr Bailey from the chamber of commerce. 

They are a membership representative group. It is their job to fight for their members and I respect that [Bookmark: Phr11_O=165.6_D=29.0_C=0.84] , but there is a line between advocacy and strong negotiations, and then dragging the House into a level of politics which muddies and messes the water. There is mud - let us call it mud - that is splashed over the major industrials, because sometimes I wish people would fight harder for the mums and dads in Rokeby, Risdon Vale and Clarendon Vale [Bookmark: Phr12_O=195.6_D=26.5_C=0.82]  who have to pay their Aurora bills and are struggling from month to month, pay to pay, to pay them.

It is not a zero-sum game that the major industrials should get a level of treatment and respect. Mums and dads and families of Tasmania should also be heard in this debate and their suffering from increases in energy prices.  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=222.3_D=4.4_C=0.80] I respect the advocacy from the industry. They are fighting for their members [Bookmark: Phr14_O=226.9_D=30.0_C=0.81]  and they are fighting for those industries and I completely respect that. It is completely proper for the Labor Party to prosecute the case on their behalf. I am not disrespecting that at all.

There are a couple of specific questions, and I want to say every question in Question Time is a loaded question. I have been a minister and I know that you get up and you hear the question and you provide an answer [Bookmark: Phr15_O=257.1_D=28.4_C=0.77]  as best you can based on what you have heard and based on your read of the politics of the moment. You have made a case that the minister is struggling on his feet to explain this. He is struggling to articulate what is happening. I have no personal beef with the minister, but I do wish that in terms of his responses this week, he could have been better in explaining [Bookmark: Phr16_O=286.7_D=1.7_C=0.49]  what the challenges are [Bookmark: Phr17_O=289.1_D=15.9_C=0.79]  and how he and the government are going to respond to help the major industrials. If your case is saying that you have a minister who is struggling to explain and you think he needs to do better, you have achieved that. You have a tick there from me.

Initially, when you asked these questions in your contribution, Leader of the Opposition, you did say you asked a series of specific questions on that matter and you did. Early on in the debate, I was given a page by the opposition talking about an ABC radio bulletin on 10 April which paraphrases and seeks to quote Mr Mostogl. Then you gave me the TCCI media release as well, as a defence that he has misled the House. I believe that these two things do not actually add up to the minister misleading the House and should add up to me losing confidence in him.

After lunch there were a couple of letters. You would think that there had been some questions on this all week. You think these things could have been presented, and if the minister had them in Question Time today, we may not be here now. In terms of these two letters, I do not believe there is a contradiction. I believe there are different forms of information provided in different ways around real and nominal numbers. I do not believe the numbers are necessarily confusing or they are two different letters and you have a smoking gun here. I just think it is articulated in a different way. 

This is up to the government to explain: maybe they feel that the first version did not explain it well enough and the second version - and I am being graceful to the minister and the government on that. You lucked in that you had those two things, because I believe prior to lunch, having those two quotes - one from the ABC bulletin which does not say 20 per cent, it says 15 to 20 per cent - and Mr Bailey quite rightly talks about the issue. I am absolutely respectful to both Mr Mostogl and Mr Bailey, but just because industry advocates say it is true, does not make it true. They have a right to argue their case and fight the fight, and I get that. 
I have had over many years people present to me stats and information which purport to suit their argument, but there are always two sides to the argument. I believe they have an argument about the costs that are impacting major industrials. They have a genuine case to argue, but then the extra jump forward and the extra step forward for the opposition to then say that the minister misled the House and therefore he has no confidence, there is no confidence. Specifically because of the exact question that was asked, maybe the answer was fumbled, but in terms of the question you asked, your proposition that he misled the House cannot be sustained. There is not enough in this to say that Mr Duigan should resign his commission because the House has lost confidence, because I believe that would be the consequence of this.

I believe he needs to do better at working with the industry. I believe he needs to do better at explaining what is actually happening with the cost structures going through. These are commercial negotiations between government business enterprises and multinational companies, although Norske Skog is now going through the transition for Mr Marriner. We are dealing with multinational companies who go around the world and they go after governments. They say, if you do not do this for us, we are going to pack up and take our tent and go home, or we will not invest. 

That is the nature of global economics where governments need to be in the ring fighting for their community, but also making sure that we stand up and there is a full value and fair value for the energy that we generate. Market rates and discounted rates are a contentious thing in Tasmania but one thing is clear: these are very important companies. The gentlemen on behalf of their organisations need to be listened to. 

I believe that 'If you add 'em up and you do it over two years, oh, yeah, we've got there' - that is a bit beneath us. I believe we are better than that in this House. It is pretty clear the minister needs to be better at explaining what is going on.

I suppose from this debate the minister is on notice in terms of his responses, but he still has my confidence. I cannot support this motion because the case has not been made.

[3.43 p.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I, too, wish to contribute to this motion. As Mr O'Byrne already set out, for this parliament to make the grave finding that a minister has misled it has to find that the statement of the minister was factually incorrect or false, and that the minister knew at the time, or could reasonably have known, that the statement was false or there was an intention by the minister to mislead the parliament.

This is a factual argument, and we are being asked to make a finding with grave consequences without sufficient information. Based on what has been circulated in writing by Labor, the false statement by the ministry is that prices for major industrials have gone up by nowhere near 20 per cent, along with the subsequent statements in parliament rejecting assertions they had gone up by 20 per cent. This statement needs some context and Labor has not included the context to the minister's statement.

I am surprised the government has not sought to argue this point. Mr Duigan's statement that prices have not gone up by 20 per cent was in response to the original question from the Labor leader on 2 April, 2025. The question was, and I read this from the Hansard from 2 April. 

Mr WINTER question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, MR DUIGAN

[10.01 a.m.]
It is no secret that some of Tasmania's largest businesses are facing serious challenges. The collapse of Whyalla Steelworks and concerns about the future of the entire GFG alliance has left some 300 Tasmanian employees employed at Liberty Bell Bay extremely concerned for their future.

Can you confirm that your government increased energy transmission costs across our four major industrials by nearly 20 per cent this financial year and is set to increase them by more than 10 per cent this coming year? Why are you and your energy policy pushing these proud Tasmanian businesses up against the wall?

Minister Duigan did not really answer the question, which is not unusual in this place, and perhaps this whole mess can be a wake-up call to ministers to be clearer in their answers. Presumably, he went away and got some advice on this and was provided with the actual figures by TasNetworks or his advisers. Those figures are commercial and confidential, so perhaps it is no surprise that he did not provide the exact figures when he was repeatedly questioned about it in parliament over the next two weeks.

In his media release of 2 April, the minister answered that electricity prices had not gone up by anywhere near 20 per cent. This must be assumed to be a response to Mr Winter's initial question which was time-bound, which I have already read from the Hansard. Mr Winter's reference to 20 per cent was 20 per cent this financial year, so Mr Duigan's subsequent reference to 20 per cent is clearly related to the original question.

The subsequent questions by the Labor leader lack the clarity to pin down the minister. Had Mr Winter been clear enough to ask the minister if he was denying that the energy prices for the major industrials had gone up by 20 per cent over two years, had he provided that timeframe and minister Duigan then denied this, based on that information that we have now been provided by the government, then there would be an argument to be made that he was misleading parliament.

Labor relied on a comment that Ray Mostogl made to media this morning to prove that what Mr Duigan is saying is false. I understand, from what has been provided to me by Labor by way of a written summary of their argument, is that Mr Mostogl told ABC this morning that transmission prices have gone up by up to 20 per cent. I have also been told Mr Mostogl said the prices have gone up by 15 to 20 per cent, but what are the timeframes we are talking about?

The motion made no reference to timeframes. This whole debate, this whole motion, is founded on loose questions and selective quoting. The government has finally provided some information to enable us to clearly determine the matter, and it shows that Mr Duigan was not misrepresenting the parliament when he denied that prices had gone up by 20 per cent because the time period was not clarified by the Labor leader.

Can this parliament find what Mr Duigan told this parliament about energy prices to be false and that he knew it to be false? No, it cannot. I certainly cannot and I will be voting against this motion.
I will finish by noting the majority of the debate so far on this topic has been highly political, with most members' time being focused on the importance of major industrials to our economy, which shows this motion for what it is. I think we have just wasted two hours of the parliament's time, although I will also make the point that, thanks to the government's lack of bills for us to debate, we have plenty of time to waste.

[3.48 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to make my contribution on this very important matter. What we have before us is a serious allegation made by the Labor opposition in relation to a minister of the Crown. We are right to explore that allegation and understand the issues because it is a serious allegation. Both the minister deserves the opportunity to put the facts forward and the opposition deserve the opportunity to put their case forward. I have listened very carefully to the debate. What I wanted from the Labor opposition was evidence that their claims can be verified. We have heard from a number of members on the crossbench about their concerns, but what we have are statements made in the media, or statements made by peak bodies, rather than actual evidence of the increase itself.

That is not enough to justify what we have before us in this serious allegation. The evidence provided by both the government and the opposition is nothing short of confusing. We have two letters floating around that purport to be providing the same information, but clearly have mixed messages. There is confusion amongst all parties, as I understand, about the timeframes to which they are referring and the time of the reporting periods for the increases of which we are talking. We hear from the peak body that they are talking about increases over the financial year, and yet what is clear from the correspondence is we are talking about a two-year period. We also have different kinds of figures, whether they are 'nominal' or 'real'. 

There is general confusion here. I cannot see clear evidence that what minister Duigan has put on the record is misleading. Without having seen a bill from either major industrials it is very difficult to be able to say with certainty that minister Duigan has misled this Parliament. We only have representations and media statements to rely upon. The case has not been set out in relation to the minister being misleading. However, I do think, on consideration of the Hansard, that the case has been made that minister Duigan misled the parliament in relation to Mrs Pentland's question, and that is a very serious matter.

He did not take up the opportunity to come back and correct the record. That may have been an innocent misleading of the parliament in answer to Mrs Pentland's question yesterday. He should have done the right thing and come back into this House and corrected the record at the earliest opportunity. He did not take that opportunity even when questioned again today. That is very serious.

I need to look at the totality of the motion before us. If Labor had perhaps limited their allegation to the issue of misleading in relation to Mrs Pentland's question, then I probably would have been able to support that. I recognise the frustration there. I am torn because I have two different examples of claims or allegations of misleading. One I think has legitimate claim. I can see the evidence is very clear on the Hansard. The other is nothing short of confusing.

On balance, I cannot support the motion in its totality and that is what we are debating here today. Having said that, though, I want to make it really clear that the minister's conduct has shown that it is not acceptable to either the parliament or the community to come in here and obfuscate when it comes to questions; particularly questions about transparency, significant impacts on our major industrials, and about integrity. We have seen the minister time and time again get up in questioning, both on Wednesday and Thursday last week, and Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday this week, when he ought to have been prepared, to have had the information or sought the advice, and he has obfuscated at every opportunity in relation to questioning. Yes, I agree with Mr Garland: the question from the Leader of Opposition could have been tighter, but it should not take a very precise question to get the genuine facts on the table by the minister. The minister has an obligation to come into this place, be honest and frank and provide information. The provision of information assists the democratic process but we have seen him try and avoid the question time and time again. He should have done better.

The minister is on notice, as far as I am concerned. I have no doubt that Labor will continue to pursue this particular issue, and so they should. We are coming back here in three weeks. I expect to see a significant improvement in the minister's performance in Question Time. He needs to be honest, open, transparent, frank and forthcoming with information. You should not have to drag information out of ministers. It is not acceptable. Whilst I cannot support the motion in its totality, the ministry is on notice; it is not good enough.

[3.53 p.m.]
Dr BROAD (Braddon) -  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=21.8_D=13.3_C=0.74] Honourable Speaker, I will only make a short contribution to wind up. I am not sure if there are any other speakers. If anybody wants to speak, then you had better indicate that, because we have a handshake agreement to finish at 4.00 p.m. I would like to make a couple of points.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=36.8_D=19.1_C=0.79] The evidence that we have before us supports our argument. It can be construed to support our argument, especially in the letter that the Premier tabled and which he read from, which is different from the version that was distributed earlier in the day. I would argue that the first letter that we received, which only talked about [Bookmark: Phr5_O=56.4_D=25.6_C=0.79]  increases in power prices in real terms, was the second draft, and the first draft is the one that the Premier read from accidentally and ended up tabling, also probably not realising the context. This is the key point: when compared to the prior year, the four MIs - Bell Bay Aluminium, Liberty, Nyrstar and Norske - on average faced a 13.9 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=82.1_D=3.7_C=0.75]  per cent increase in nominal terms in 2024-25, which is this year.

Our contention was that - and this is what we have been discussing the whole time - major industrials have faced increases of up to 20 per cent. The figures that we have received are an average over four major industrials of 13.9 per cent. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=111.2_D=3.8_C=0.67]  We know that there are commercial-in-confidence [Bookmark: Phr9_O=115.6_D=16.7_C=0.90]  aspects around this. We do not know exactly how much each of these major industrials has paid, but it is plausible that one or more of them are closer to the 20 per cent and others may have had less. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=133.2_D=26.7_C=0.79]  The information that we have is an average of four equalling 13.9 per cent. The information that we are getting from Ray Mostogl could be accurate . Our estimate, and what Ray Mostogl has said on the record, is a lot closer to accurate than what the minister has been saying. 

The minister has been saying 'Nothing to see here' and has been simply quoting [Bookmark: Phr11_O=160.3_D=1.8_C=0.62]  the first line [Bookmark: Phr12_O=162.6_D=24.6_C=0.81]  of one of these versions, which is that in real terms, the network charges for all customers directly connected to the transmission network have decreased by 3.3 per cent over the past decade. That is what the minister has been relying on. We have been saying that the industry has been telling us that there have been increases of up to 20 per cent, and the information we have before us is that the average [Bookmark: Phr13_O=188.0_D=13.7_C=0.66]  across four is 13.9 per cent. It means that our version of the truth is a lot closer than the minister's version of the truth.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=202.3_D=27.2_C=0.84] It is such a shame. I reflect on the comments of the Independent member for Clark in her contribution. She is right. It should not take a debate like this before we get the information. We would not have had a case, or we would have had a very weak case, if instead of the minister dragging this out for two weeks, we had received this exact information - the second version - the one that the Premier tabled today [Bookmark: Phr15_O=230.2_D=1.3_C=0.61] , because it would have been clear [Bookmark: Phr16_O=232.1_D=26.6_C=0.75] . Instead we are relying on averages. 

I would argue that the letters that we have received today strengthen our case that this minister has not been honest with this parliament. We are talking about an average of four major industrials that is close to 14 per cent. The minister is telling us that over 10 years things have gone down, and [Bookmark: Phr17_O=259.4_D=3.4_C=0.76]  the other thing that he has been saying is they face nowhere near 20 per cent increases. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=263.9_D=25.7_C=0.86]  An average across four of 14 is nowhere near 20 per cent? Why was he not honest about that? All the government do is seek to distort and not be completely honest. It takes something like a no-confidence motion in this place for us to get even the basic information. 

It should not be like this. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=292.7_D=12.2_C=0.91]  That is why we believe that this minister has to behave better, has to stand up to the Ministerial Code of Conduct and to Standing Order 2 and be honest, instead of doing everything else, instead of trying to spin, trying to deny, trying to get away with an answer that is absolutely nowhere near the truth. We have no confidence in this minister. 

I think that the case has been made in the letters provided by TasNetworks that indeed these major industrials are under significant pressure. The case can be made that some of them are paying increases of up to 20 per cent because we are talking about an average. The first version, the one that talked about everything in real terms, significantly reduced the impact because it took out the impact of inflation, so they were trying to be tricky. The process of government should be that when a minister gets asked a question, the minister should do the best they can to give an honest answer instead of not answering, denying and spinning until we can actually get some real information.

I believe that our case has been made. I believe that this House should have no confidence in this minister.

MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE 

Listening to the Experts

[4.07 p.m.]
Mr JENNER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the House take note of the following matter: listening to the experts.

Over the past year, a troubling pattern has emerged. Expert reports commissioned to inform, advise and guide us have been repeatedly dismissed, discredited or outright ignored by this government. Two of these reports, the Gruen report on the stadium and Eslake on the finances, were commissioned as a part of the former deal between the Premier and the JLN. Both Gruen and Eslake are experts in their fields and arguably two the highest-regarded economists in the country, which is why, of course, they were chosen to undertake these reports.

We all know what the reports stated. For most of us, their findings were unsurprising but nevertheless shocking. Eslake blew the lid off the state's finances, with spending far outstripping the capacity to raise revenue. The low participation rate and poor productivity levels acted as a dead weight on attempts to get things moving. The Rockliff government has been masking deeper issues by overspending, particularly on infrastructure projects. As Eslake pointed out, they forge ahead with infrastructure programs far exceeding what the economy can realistically sustain.

The Gruen report on the stadium - which I might add Saul Eslake has come out and said that he totally agrees with - blew the lid off the true cost of the project, revealing that the government has virtually no chance of keeping it capped to around $750 million. We are realistically looking at a $1 billion project. After the release of both reports, the government spin doctors went into overdrive to dress up their failings as successes, attempting to discredit both Gruen and Eslake because it did not fit the narrative: a slap in the face for two of the best economists.

It gets better. The Tasmanian Planning Commission released its own draft assessment report last Monday, which proved even more damning for the Macquarie Point Stadium. Among a multitude of other issues, it found that the stadium would contribute $1.86 billion to the state debt within the next decade, and it could potentially trigger a credit rating downgrade. The Tasmanian taxpayer will be paying $75 million a year in interest on the stadium alone. The project would roundabout cost $992 million, Tasmania's total state sector net debt.

After already four reports which stated the stadium does not stack up, you would think that the TPC's report would be the cherry on the top, that the government would finally listen to the expert advice. However, in a move that shocked no one, the government instead came out claiming that the report underplayed the immense benefits of the stadium and the precinct that it will unlock. It is an insult to every expert commissioned to undertake these reports, each with decades of experience in their fields. For this government then to turn around and attempt to discredit their work is quite disgraceful, in my opinion. It is not enough that the government is not listening to the experts, but it is now no longer listening to the very people it represents, in my opinion. 

Last week the Premier got up and said that if the stadium meant his approval ratings would slip he did not care. I have received numerous calls and emails, and had meetings urging the government to put the stadium issue to a vote. I think it is only fair, given that the Tasmanian people will be funding most of it, or at least a large part of this enterprise. Is it not time we renegotiated a new deal with the AFL, one that serves Tasmania and not the AFL, or at least put it to the Tasmanians to vote on it? 

This morning, it came up that Dr Gruen had spoken to people who were against the stadium before the report. I am not disagreeing with that. I am not saying it is right, but of course it is very hard not to talk to anyone about the stadium because it is a hot topic. However, the measure of its relevance - and of course this is subjective - I have to say the report was based on finance and facts, not hearsay of who you spoke to.

[4.13 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, I am reminded when reference is made to 'experts' of the unkind definition of 'expert', which is 'X' - an unknown quantity - and 'spurt' - a drip under pressure. Apart from that, we have to recognise that experts disagree with each other. The very two you mentioned, Gruen and Eslake, both highly regarded economists in their own right - one very negative to the stadium, the other very positive to the stadium; and KPMG, an expert organisation, had certain views as well.

Let us consider experts. In 1935, Australians, especially in Queensland, were told that the best thing to get rid of the cane beetle was the introduction of the cane toad. It did not work out so well, did it? Expert advice. During the Great Depression, there were doctors advising people that if they took up smoking they might protect themselves from the common cold - advice not too flash, on reflection. I remember before the year 2000, with the Y2K problem, the experts telling us we were about to face Armageddon. It never occurred. I remember Professor Tim Flannery, an expert on climate change, telling us that the Brisbane River would never flood again. Guess what? It has; not once, not twice, but three times. So we go on, with experts giving us the benefit of their opinion.

Might I add, experts can be so exceptionally learned that sometimes they miss the important element, which is common sense. Expertise in a topic requires applying common sense, reason and logic to background knowledge. Knowledge can be learned, but common sense has to be earned. So-called 'experts' have learned background knowledge, but sometimes without necessarily earning the common sense needed to correctly interpret it.

I make those general comments. As a lawyer, when cases go to court, you have eminent experts on both sides arguing a different case. Does that mean they are both right, just because they are experts? What I have found in life in general terms is that the more learned and experienced somebody is, the less likely they are that they want to be called an 'expert' because they recognise there is so much they do not know.

I recognise that this topic was brought on in relation to the stadium. All I would say is that you have eminent economists like Gruen saying 44 cents in the dollar; we then had the Planning Commission saying 53 cents and KPMG 69 cents - all experts in their own right, with really different outcomes. Which one of them is right? Which one should government be listening to? 

You have to factor in a lot of common sense and other issues. With respect to the Gruen report - a good report as far as it might go in certain circumstances - what did it overlook and what did it not do? It did not talk about the $360 million benefit that the AFL would be putting into the Tasmanian community over a decade in the event of a team, which of course is predicated on a stadium. 

In relation to Dr Gruen himself, can I say it is for me unfathomable that somebody who has written so many reports in his day overlooked the fact of telling the government that he had been invited to talk to 'no stadium' supporters prior to being recommended by the Jacqui Lambie Network to be the so-called independent person to consider the stadium, then failed to tell anybody about that, then snuck it up on his website without telling the government and the people who paid him for the report.

Why would you do that? Even experts like Dr Gruen can err; and he did, and he erred egregiously.

Time expired.

[4.18 p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Deputy Speaker, I rise on this matter of public importance and thank the member for bringing on this matter about experts. I will not admit to people outside of this place that I echo the sentiments of Mr Abetz, the member who has just resumed his seat. I will not admit I have done that.

Dr Broad - There is Hansard.

Mr O'BYRNE - There is Hansard, but he does make a good point. There are experts and then there are experts. People have referred to economics as 'the dismal science'. There is a great old saying that economists are very good at whipping up a PowerPoint to tell you what is going to happen, but much better at whipping up a PowerPoint to explain why it did not happen.

In every form, in every part of life, there are experts, people who know a range of matters about a certain topic. The medical profession, for example - people get second opinions all the time. There are misdiagnoses all the time. It is an ongoing debate and discussion. In terms of the nature of this matter of public importance, what triggered this is clearly the debate around the Gruen Report. 

All economists should be open, and I know they welcome critique of their work. In fact, a number of economists I know contacted me and were questioning elements of Dr Gruen's analysis, including the underlying assumptions and where he landed. That is the business that Dr Gruen is in.

Dr Gruen is a well-regarded economist. He has done a large body of fine work, but in this case I think he struggled, and we have raised issues. There are a couple of rolled gold examples where, in terms of the business case for the stadium and crowd numbers, he cherrypicked a couple of games in Hobart - North Melbourne versus Giants, or North Melbourne versus Carlton at a time when Carlton was struggling, and chose to ignore the Hawthorn versus Carlton games, which had significantly larger crowds. 

Why did he choose certain games over others? Since he is an economist, he may not fully appreciate the drawing power of Collingwood Football Club.

Mr Abetz - Now you are losing me.

Mr O'BYRNE - Well, they get the biggest crowds. The idea that a Giants versus North Melbourne game at Bellerive would attract a similar crowd to a Tasmania versus Collingwood game is clearly laughable.

On the example of the Goods Shed, Dr Gruen estimated the cost of moving the Goods Shed at $18 million, despite Macquarie Point Corporation estimating it to be $6 million, and the Gruen-appointed quantity surveyor estimating it at $7 million. In his report he said, 'I've had conversations', but he does not detail who those conversations were with, does not provide an explanation about why he dismisses both the Macquarie Point estimate and the quantity surveyor estimate. He has just provided an opinion - to me, an opinion that does not stack up.

In relation to Dr Gruen's work, I think he should be open to a critique. There are things that he says that I agree with, but I think other things are naive to the circumstances and the reality of what was happening. His blind acceptance of the other proposal out at Regatta Point seemed to be a real jump. I do not understand how we got to that, because that is not a project at all. That is just some photos with a bit of good spin in it. 

There are a number of matters where it just does not stack up. The reason why people are questioning it is not because we are questioning the experts. We are in terms of the critique, but the reasons why we are saying, 'There's a problem', is because his actions and the actions of the Jacqui Lambie Network and the actions of people from Our Place that have completely compromised his work. It was the Jacqui Lambie Network set it up. They dragged him in; they worded people up. He did not disclose it, and if it was so innocent, why has he still not disclosed it? He was before the Public Accounts Committee only a week-and-a-half ago and which report did he submit? The report that did not include the secret meetings. 

There is a pattern of behaviour where, unfortunately, Dr Gruen's own actions have dragged him into politics. The Jacqui Lambie Network, through the federal leader and the federal leader's office, has established this stench around the process of choosing Dr Gruen. I have spoken informally to people who were interviewed by him. They will speak for themselves, but they have a clear view about how their information, their data and their perspective was taken. Respect the experts, but it is not a Bible; it is not the law; it is a piece of advice that we need to accept or reject.

Mr WILLIE (Clark) -  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=31.6_D=19.1_C=0.82] Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak on this matter of public importance and thank the member for bringing it forward. In his opening remarks, he did say that this government has a problem listening to experts in recent times. I would argue this government has had a problem listening to experts its entire time it has been in government [Bookmark: Phr3_O=52.7_D=9.3_C=0.82] . I can bring up a number of reports and warning signs from experts in terms of the state's finances.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=62.7_D=12.7_C=0.84] I have been fortunate to be a member of the Public Accounts Committee for nearly six years in both Houses. I remember one of the fiscal sustainability reports compiled by the Treasury. The treasurer at the time, Peter Gutwein, came to the committee and dismissed it, basically. He said they were projections, that it was not a forecast and it did not mean they were going to happen. Treasury was warning, under the four scenarios, that the state's finances were heading into troubled water and this government ignored it. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=96.2_D=29.4_C=0.80]  They did not take any corrective action. 

What they did was loosen the purse strings and spent close to $1.5 billion at three elections and did not outline any plan to pay for it. What does that mean now? It means that the state's finances have never been worse. We have some of the biggest deficits in the state's history in the past two years, and we have a ballooning debt figure of $9.6 billion in the last year of the forward Estimates that will require $500 million to service the debt - not to pay it off, just to service the debt.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=133.6_D=24.4_C=0.79] That is one example of this government not listening to the experts. There are plenty of others. Moody's credit rating agency recently downgraded Tasmania's outlook from stable to negative. They issued quite a lot of warnings in their commentary; they said that there was weakening governance and there was a ballooning debt burden. What was the government's response? 'Debt is manageable [Bookmark: Phr10_O=164.8_D=7.4_C=0.79] .' In that report, they set a threshold at which they will downgrade the state's credit rating, which means higher interest on that ballooning debt.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=173.1_D=10.6_C=0.77] Another credit rating agency, S&P, shared a very similar outlook. They also downgraded Tasmania's outlook from stable to negative. They also set a threshold in their commentary. I believe both credit rating agencies have questioned the fiscal discipline and fiscal strategy. Not verbatim, but they did say it was not worth the paper it was written on because there was no discipline [Bookmark: Phr13_O=199.1_D=2.3_C=0.72] . The government's response each time? 'Debt is manageable.'

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=202.8_D=23.8_C=0.76] This completely ignores the expert warnings. We have had other financial reports like CommSec's 'State of the States'. We have negative employment growth. We have the treasurer crowing about a NAB business survey of 500 people when every other economic report coming out at the moment is pointing to a government that has [Bookmark: Phr15_O=227.4_D=4.6_C=0.75]  failed in terms of managing the state's finances and is now failing in terms of managing the economy. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=233.0_D=29.4_C=0.78]  In the CommSec report, we are bottom of the table in annual growth rates across the eight indicators. Deloitte produced another report, a forecast. They are projecting weakening economic growth for the state through to 2030, and we are facing a jobs crisis. That is Deloitte saying that, but we have the Treasurer trying to paint some alternate universe in which everything is rosy and everything is fine.
 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=263.4_D=27.4_C=0.75] 
In recent times, we have had Mr Eslake do a report on the state's finances. We have discussed that report a lot in this Chamber. I disagree with some elements of that report, like increasing tax or introducing new ones. What was this government's response to that report? They dismissed most of it. Very poor response. Did not even pick up some of the fiscal guardrails, some helpful suggestions [Bookmark: Phr18_O=291.6_D=6.6_C=0.66] . It has taken the parliament to talk about some of those things, pass motions and encourage the government to pick them up. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=298.7_D=6.3_C=0.82]  We did as the opposition. We announced a 10-point plan for budget repair last year. We picked up a number of his recommendations because there are some good fiscal guardrails there. This government needs those sorts of guardrails because the way they are managing the state's finances is a disgrace. They continue to ignore experts in a very important area of government and it is going to impact future generations. They have mortgaged the state's future because they have ignored the experts. They have ignored the warnings. 

Time expired. 

[4.28 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I remind the House that yesterday was 12 months since we were sworn in, when the declaration of the polls came about. In the twelve months since then - I know that we started on 14 May - there have been myriad experts presenting to this parliament. That is a lot for relatively very short time.

Let us look at the economists who have been commissioned to review benefits or otherwise of the stadium at Macquarie Point. We have heard discussion about and undermining of Dr Nicholas Gruen. Is Dr Nicholas Gruen a nationally recognised economist, and is Saul Eslake highly regarded and regarded nationally? The answer to both, of course, is yes. Yet we have perpetual, continued undermining of their positions and their reports.

The Project of State Significance process to address and assess the Macquarie Point Stadium, whether the Greens like it or not, was chosen by this government to assist the Macquarie Point Stadium proposal. This was undertaken at the Premier's instructions in order to have the appropriate assessment guidelines. What has happened? The Tasmanian Planning Commission report, the interim report which allows the public to understand the gathering of information, has been undermined. It has been undermined as to how they have written the report, what information they have drawn on, and whose expert information has been drawn on to reach their conclusions or their assessments. 

There are other reports. I will quote from the City of Hobart Planning Agenda report from last night. This is a short report, but it is written by experts. 

In response, the Macquarie Point Development Corporation has criticised the draft report, claiming it contains errors of law, is incomplete, argumentative and lacks balance.

That is the Macquarie Point Development Corporation (MPDC), the proponent on behalf of the government, complaining about expert reports. Is that not just typical of some proponents who want to disregard experts? There we see it writ large. 

I will go to another part of that same report. This part is about financial and economic consequences. It discusses council expenditure, 

The Council has expended over $150 000 to date on obtaining the necessary qualified advice to guide it in its response through the POSS process. The Council made such an investment in good faith to provide an impartial response to the proposal in the knowledge that such information would be considered in the decision-making.

This is a report that the local council has made in good faith. Unfortunately, we can see that it is to no end, really.

We have experts undermined by this government. The problem, which Mr Jenner identified very well, is that when you undermine the experts, you also undermine public confidence. It is something we should all be concerned about because the Ipsos Global Trustworthiness Index 2024 has, as the most trusted professions, doctors, teachers, scientists, police, up there between 48 and 66 per cent. Where does it have Cabinet officials and government ministers? There is 17 per cent trustworthiness. That is a ranking way down at the bottom of trustworthiness.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - What about Deputy Speakers?

Ms BURNET - Deputy Speakers? It is not listed. This is a blight on this parliament.

[4.33 p.m.]
Mr BEHRAKIS (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, 'Listen to the experts,' we are told. By that we can only assume people mean their preferred particular expert. Something that I saw pretty often when I was on the Hobart City Council, where certain members of council were happy to pull the old, 'We have to listen to everything the experts say' when the experts are recommending for a refusal of a development, but when the recommendation is the other way, they are very happy to disregard those very same experts.

When it comes to the Macquarie Point Stadium, it seems that many people have adopted Dr Gruen as their preferred expert. As was so eloquently explained in this place last night and today by minister Abetz and Mr O'Byrne, some of the vitriol that has been unleashed on those who have raised issues with Dr Gruen's approach and analysis has been disgraceful. I will not cover the ground that minister Abetz and Mr O'Byrne have so eloquently and expertly covered last night, but I wanted to take this time to touch on some of the points in Dr Gruen's report and methodology. To start with, his projections of visitation, in particular, interstate visitation numbers, were quite perplexing. He criticised the KPMG report, saying that their assumptions seemed very high and provided no empirical support. The report revised it down to what seemed more accurate, from the 25 per cent of visitors being from interstate that the KPMG report outlined, to just 10 per cent based on what seemed more accurate. 

Let us talk about empirical evidence. Dark Mofo 2023 had 432,000 visitors, approximately 50 per cent of whom were from interstate according to figures. The Wooden Boat Festival had 55,000 visitors. Roughly 50 per cent of those were from interstate. The Festival of Voices had 30,000, with almost 18 per cent from interstate, and the last Taste of Summer had 88,000 visitors, 34 per cent from interstate. It seems to me, Deputy Speaker, looking at the evidence and empirical data on hand, that the KPMG report is far more reflective of the reality. 

The Gruen report goes on to criticise the KPMG report and the MPDC for not factoring in opportunity costs of the land. In the report, it defines the opportunity cost as the value of the land which - and I might not have a PhD as Dr Gruen does, but I do have a bachelor's degree in economics - is not quite what opportunity cost is generally made out to be. Opportunity cost is a cost of the next-best alternative and, if we are being magnanimous to Dr Gruen and his report, and we continue with his definition, the report goes on to say:

In the case of land, capital cost should include the opportunity cost of land use, even when it is currently owned by the government. Building or constructing a house on land they own for later sale would factor in the value or opportunity cost of the land.

That makes a fair point. A builder does value in the value of the land that he is building on, even if he owns it, but they will value in the value of unimproved land. The report goes on to acknowledge that Elders Real Estate has estimated that the value of that land is approximately $49 million. It then goes on, though, to extrapolate that, based on the footprint, talking about property prices in neighbouring suburbs, they have calculated the opportunity cost of being between $236 and $386 million, and then decided to land on the midpoint of $311 million.

In the report, in the very next paragraph, it goes on to say:

This has generated substantial controversy amongst those we have discussed it with, and in light of that, we have halved the figure to ensure our central case was conservative. This gives us an opportunity cost for the land of approximately $155 million.

We have a report that has not only criticised the report by KPMG, but also went as far as criticising the professional integrity of the authors, especially criticising them for not factoring in or calculating opportunity cost or making assumptions without empirical support. That same report, after calculating a figure of $311 million, has said, 'Oh, well, people didn't really seem to like the number we came out with, so we decided to read the room, split the difference and just arbitrarily - let's call it half and land on $150 million, but everybody should 100 per cent trust and place credibility in what we're saying, use it and factor it into decision and policy-making and just trust us'. Really?

If the number had any value, they would not have revised it based on controversy that they have received. It would have stood on the value of their own calculations. That is one of the concerns that I believe many have with that. On the topic of the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC), a report that has factored that in, even though it was not supposed to, is similarly tainted.

[4.38 p.m.]
Mrs PENTLAND (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance. It is timely because I and the member for Braddon have just released a public statement covering some of the issues Mr Jenner has touched on.

I found the Premier's comments this morning regarding Dr Nicholas Gruen and the Tasmanian Planning Commission disappointing. I respect the Premier's passion for the stadium project, but the reputations of good people should not be collateral damage. Of course, Dr Gruen and his report should not be immune from scrutiny, but I would urge the government to play the ball, not the man. Dr Gruen should have disclosed his initial meeting with opponents of the project, but the reaction has been out of proportion. His report remains a valuable contribution to the debate and I will say that Dr Gruen's name was initially put forward by Saul Eslake, who, as the Leader of Government Business says, is far from anti-stadium.

The government's criticism of the Tasmanian Planning Commission is regrettable. The government is well within its rights to defend the project, but it should not come at the expense of our planning system. Undermining the TPC and the professional people who make up stadium panels sends the wrong message to the public. As the member for Braddon said in her statement, it is below the belt.

The panel is made up of highly-respected members of the community who do not deserve to have their credibility questioned under the protection of parliamentary privilege, and in this case of Dr Gruen, I hope he is given a right of reply. The government chose to assess the stadium as a project of state significance. It is disappointing it is now undermining its own process. I would like to note that other elected representatives have made it clear that the POSS process is important and have cautioned the government from going down a different path; but it would appear, based on the Premier's comments this morning and his lack of confidence in the TPC, that a new process will soon be announced. Watch this space.

[4.41 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I will cut to the chase because I think it is really disappointing and disgusting, in fact, that the Premier got up in this place this morning and said that members of the TPC had a credibility issue, and I want to put on the Hansard who those five panel members are on the TPC who have produced the Draft Integrated Assessment Report:

Paul Turner SC, former assistant Solicitor-General;

Gary Prattley, extensive experience and involvement in planning across both New Zealand and Australia;

Lynn Mason AM, 30 years' experience in local government, President LGAT, former chair of Tasmanian Affordable Housing, Metro, Tasmanian Community Fund, former director of Crime Stoppers;

Shelley Penn AM, over 35 years' experience in architectural practice and senior strategic advisory roles, member of several state and city design review panels, past national president Australian Institute of Architects, Deputy chair of Heritage Council Victoria; and

Martin Wallace, former secretary of Tasmania's Department of Treasury and Finance, with extensive experience.

That the resolution of the Legislative Council be agreed to.

Resolution agreed to.


SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS

Senate Vacancy - Joint Sitting

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House)(by leave) - Deputy Speaker, I move -

That so much of Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent -

Any question before the House at 11.00 a.m. on Tuesday 27 May, 2025, standing adjourned until a later hour; and 

The sitting of the House then being suspended until the ringing of the bells to enable the joint sitting to be held.

Motion agreed to.


ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (ALTERNATIVE VOTING PROCEDURES)BILL 2025 (No. 4)

In Committee - Consideration of Council Amendments

Clause 4 -
Part 5, Division 9A inserted

Mr BARNETT - Chair, I move the amendment from the Legislative Council -

Page 4, proposed new Division 9A, section 130B, definition of accessibility and inclusion organisation, Paragraph (a)

Leave out "special needs,".

In doing so, I acknowledge the honourable Bec Thomas from the other place who put this forward upstairs to remove the use of the term special needs from the interpretation of accessibility and inclusion organisations in the Bill.

Members may recall that just a little over a month ago, the government brought forward this electoral amendment, Alternative Voting Procedures Bill 2025, to the House. The bill inserts new Division 9A to allow the TEC (Tasmanian Electoral Commission) to approve alternative procedures that are reasonable and appropriate to facilitate voting by electors who are experiencing barriers to accessing traditional voting services. It aligns with the approach taken in the Act. It allows the Commission to approve voting procedures for electors who are in Antarctica, remote areas and out of state.

Prior to drafting the bill I met with advocates from Blind Citizens Australia, Disability Voices Tasmania, on behalf of the Coalition of People with Disability, and their advocacy is central to the purpose of this bill. I want to specifically acknowledge them and thank them for their advocacy, Blind Citizens Australia, Disability Voices Tasmania, Vaughn Bennison in particular, Duncan Meeding and Jackson Reynolds-Ryan for their contributions and for their experience that they shared with me, which have let these important amendments through.
I know that I speak and say thank you to the honourable Jo Palmer, Minister for Disability Services, Women and a range of other portfolios. She likewise met with these wonderful people. Their advocacy has made a difference. You can make a difference, you can make a difference. This is in fact a positive difference. They have done so. These amendments are now with us ready for, I hope, the support of this parliament. Having talked to the TEC, I can give you a heads up that the TEC is going to use all and best endeavours to implement these reforms with the Legislative Council elections coming up on Saturday, 24 May, so I can advise the Chamber and the public of that positive development. 

We are making a difference and that difference will kick in, in and around Saturday, 24 May for the Legislative Council. As a government, we support this amendment. I draw it to your attention and am happy to have any questions if there are any.

Ms HADDAD - Thank you, Deputy Chair. It will not surprise the minister to know that we will be supporting this amendment as we did in the Upper House. I will just add my gratitude also, as the Attorney-General did, to the advocates who worked very hard with government and alongside the Electoral Commission in many of the changes that we saw in the substantive bill. Dementia Australia made a submission, much of which was covered in the Attorney General's second reading contribution on the substantive bill, but also Disability Voices Tasmania, COTA, The Council on the Ageing and Blind Citizens Australia.

I know that there was general support from community organisations and from people with disabilities for the legislative reform. I also hope that this will be the base and the beginning of what will lead to further improvements in the future, to increase the availability of people with disability to be able to exercise their democratic right of casting a vote in elections.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=29.4_D=29.1_C=0.85] It is encouraging to hear from the Attorney-General that this will be in place in time for the state election for the upper House seats that go into the polls on 24 May. I am sure that there will be an implementation phase for those elections that are coming up next month. That will be, no doubt, a learning experience and one that we can improve upon and learn from and implement for the next state poll or the next [Bookmark: Phr4_O=58.5_D=29.0_C=0.71]  elections that come up, I suppose next year's upper House elections. 

To the amendment, the substance of the amendment, I recognise that the member for Elwick moved this amendment to remove the words 'special needs'. That is a perfectly reasonable amendment. It is a bit of an outdated term and I am sorry that I missed it in the original debate on the substantive bill. It is important that the wording in Tasmania's legislation remains modern and contemporary and that we update it as is needed. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=88.4_D=5.9_C=0.78]  I am looking forward to seeing those changes in place for the upper House elections as the Attorney-General indicated.

Ms ROSOL -  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=95.4_D=1.0_C=0.25]  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=99.4_D=16.8_C=0.84] Chair, I rise to give comment on behalf of the Greens and say that yes, we support this amendment. As Ms Haddad said, we echo an apology that this was missed when it passed through this House earlier. We express thanks to [Bookmark: Phr8_O=117.6_D=16.0_C=0.79]  Ms Thomas and those in the other House who were able to pick up on this and make that change so that this legislation is more appropriate. Language is important. We definitely support this change.

Mr BARNETT -  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=135.0_D=28.8_C=0.76] I will quickly sum up and say thank you very much for the support from my shadow and likewise the Greens member for Bass. It is greatly appreciated. Again, I thank the member for Elwick, Bec Thomas, for initiating this and coming forward based on feedback from Disability Voices Australia and COTA and perhaps others. I acknowledge Dementia Tasmania, as I did those wonderful advocates earlier in the remarks [Bookmark: Phr10_O=164.3_D=24.0_C=0.75] .

All in all, this is a good result, with collaboration, goodwill, seeing the parliament work together very well and delivering results for Tasmania. In conclusion, it was not quite a guarantee from the TEC but it was using all and best endeavours with a level of hope and confidence to deliver these reforms for the Saturday 24 Legislative Council elections.

Amendment of the Legislative Council agreed to.

Resolution agreed to.

Youth Week Tasmania 2025

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=214.9_D=11.3_C=0.61]  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=227.8_D=1.2_C=0.60] [4.52 p.m.]
Mr JAENSCH (Braddon - Minister for Children and Youth) - Deputy Speaker, I rise tonight to speak on an important week for children and young people and their communities right across Tasmania. Today, as Minister for Children and Youth, I was proud to announce the opening of Youth Week 2025. We recognise Tasmania's young people as the next generation of leaders, change makers, influencers and visionaries who are shaping our state, and this is an important opportunity to celebrate [Bookmark: Phr17_O=266.6_D=29.0_C=0.88]  them.

Youth Week Tasmania has been running since 2018 and has provided an opportunity for celebrating the efforts and contributions of young people aged 12 to 25 in their communities. It aims to be inclusive of all young Tasmanians from all of our communities. Youth Week Tasmania 2025 celebrates the theme Courage: Stepping out of your Comfort Zone. It was developed through feedback from past Youth [Bookmark: Phr18_O=295.8_D=6.0_C=0.74]  Network of Tasmania participants and was chosen by the Premier's Youth Advisory Council.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=302.8_D=2.1_C=0.84] In advance of Youth Week, I wanted to spend some time reflecting on the theme and what it means for our youth and for us. Stepping out of your comfort zone means embracing new experiences and new challenges. Often, we get stuck doing the same things over and over again and shying away from things we do not know or like or have no experience of.

This year's theme is a timely reminder of the importance of challenging ourselves. It gives us all an opportunity to come together, be courageous and, importantly, to have some fun. Challenging yourself pushes you to learn new things, to adapt to different situations and develop new skills. Trying new things can broaden our perspectives and understanding of the world and of ourselves. Successfully overcoming challenges outside your comfort zone can boost self-esteem and confidence and, who knows, you might discover talents or passions by venturing into unfamiliar territory. This is all an important element in the growth of our young people. 

If I could take a few moments to indulge the House with my own personal experience of stepping outside of my comfort zone, in 2013 I made the decision - with my family's support, I must add - to resign from my job of 13 years and stand for the seat of Braddon. My job was not always comfortable, but it was at least secure and known to me at the time. Whilst I observed politics and politicians and different levels of government from a safe distance for quite some time, it had never been an area that I had experienced directly before, let alone the peculiar free-falling feeling of leaving a secure job and putting yourself up for the judgment and scrutiny of your peers for the first time.

It was quite a humbling experience, exhilarating in some ways, certainly well outside of my comfort zone, particularly as a person who did not grow up in Tasmania, but had come from Western Australia 13 years before. I was putting myself forward to be elected by a community of people who knew our place here much better than I and it was their birthright. I was overwhelmed with the support that I received and, suffice to say, became elected and have been since.

I never take that for granted, but I do remember what it took to back myself, to step outside of my comfort zone, to test my belief and the knowledge I have of what I thought our community was looking for at the time. It paid off for me. It does not always, the first time that people try something different and I know that sometimes, for our young people, they have become disheartened or discouraged by not succeeding when they had hoped to; but we need to ensure that Tasmania is a place where everyone feels encouraged to step outside their comfort zone, to back themselves, to give other people the opportunity to step outside their comfort zone and to try something new and to give people a chance to be great.

I know a lot of people in our roles who we speak to, talk about young people today. We often hear a commentary, often negative, 'Young people today.' Those people have not spent time with young people today. I spent time with young people today at the Link Health Service here in Hobart. I joined a group of young people who are developing murals expressing their view of stepping outside their comfort zone, putting their artwork out for others to see. I encourage everybody to support Youth Week activities in their communities right across Tasmania.

Heritage Tasmania - Northern Office Relocation

[4.57 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I rise this evening to speak about the relocation of the Heritage Tasmania Northern Office from the Launceston CBD to Prospect. We first heard about this in late December. Just before Christmas, staff in the office were advised that they were going to be moved from their current location in the CBD in the government buildings there. There was quite some concern amongst the staff. I wrote to the Premier at the time in early January because the move is being made so that the Premier has more space and so things are more secure. I have not received a response about that yet, so now I have some questions on notice about it to the minister for Heritage and I am waiting for a response.
Since that time, I know that things have moved along with the movement of the office. Initially, staff were not consulted at all in this process. They were just told that the move was going to happen. Then the union became involved and were able to represent the staff there. Following the union's involvement, there was a consultation process that happened. As part of that process, the staff were able to express that they do not want to move from the CBD out to Prospect, but unfortunately the decision has been made for that move to happen regardless of what the staff think and how they feel.

I would like to get on the record here tonight some of the problems with the move from the CBD of Launceston out to Prospect. The current CBD location is beautifully central and well located for the services that Heritage Tasmania staff provide. It is within regular walking distance of a high concentration of heritage buildings within the Launceston central area. Those buildings include the Launceston Gas Works, Boags Brewery, the interpretation centre there, UTAS and Inveresk rail yards, Chalmers Church, Milton Hall, Albert Hall, City Park and Macquarie House. There is also the Launceston City Heart project and many other projects. I am probably a little bit biased, but Launceston's heritage treasures are many and most of them are located within the centre of Launceston.

Those central buildings make up a significant part of Heritage Tasmania's workload. The staff need to go out on site to many of those locations so that they can liaise with developers and with people who are wanting to do work in heritage buildings. They might be there doing inspections, offering pre-application advice or undertaking site assessments. They can currently walk there - it takes about 5 to 10 minutes to get to most of those locations. With the move of the office out to Prospect, that will now involve a 30-minute round trip. There will be lost time, there will be increased vehicle and parking costs and most likely a reduction in in-person service delivery.

This move is not a great move for service provision within Launceston for those people who are doing heritage work and need advice. The office has been working very well and has been effective. The staff are able to quickly get to meetings and offer a really great service from there. This is not a new issue that has come up. In 2019, this move was proposed, and at the time the Northern Accommodation Project concluded that Heritage Tasmania should not be relocated to Prospect because it would have a significant impact on the day-to-day operations of the office.

At the time, this view was endorsed by the then Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) secretary, Tim Baker, and it was supported by the then Premier, Peter Gutwein. It is unfortunate that the decision has been made to move, despite all the many good reasons for the office to stay within the CBD, and despite the staff's concerns and preference for the office to remain in the CBD. 

Heritage Tasmania's business has not changed since 2019. Its core functions remain the same and its location within Launceston CBD is important for its day-to-day operations. The Greens call on the government to do what they can to ensure that the Launceston Heritage Tasmania office remains in the CBD so they can continue to provide an excellent service for people who have heritage buildings in the area. 

Agricultural Production in Tasmania

[5.01 p.m.]
Ms HOWLETT (Lyons - Minister for Hospitality and Small Business) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak on the growth of agricultural production in Tasmania. I am pleased to say that the Tasmanian farm gate value has grown by 5 per cent on the previous year. This is according to the recently released 2022-23 Tasmanian Agri-Food Scorecard. The scorecard reports on the value and final market destinations of the state's agricultural food and beverage products. 

The gross value of agricultural production grew from $2.3 billion to $2.46 billion in 2022-23. The state's overall agri-food value, which also includes $1.56 billion in our seafood industry, grew by 10 per cent to just over $4 billion. The scorecard showed the value of seafood was up by 19 per cent to $1.56 billion, salmon leading with a contribution of $1.37 billion. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=10.6_D=29.2_C=0.83]  

Pasture-based industries accounted for 52 per cent of farm gate value due to favourable seasonal conditions and strong milk prices underpinning growth in farm gate value. Dairy was again the highest value agricultural category, increasing by 35 per cent to $684 million. The packed and processed value of food was also up by 7 per cent on the previous year to just over $6 billion. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=40.8_D=8.4_C=0.79]  

Agriculture is a backbone of our economy and our government is backing our farmers and leveraging our strengths. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=50.4_D=15.6_C=0.77]  The scorecard supports this, showing strong progress against the Tasmanian government's target to grow our farm gate value to $10 billion by 2051. 

One of the primary drivers of growth is our government's co-investment into irrigation [Bookmark: Phr5_O=66.6_D=28.1_C=0.82] , most recently, the $218-million Northern Midlands Irrigation Scheme and the $301-million Greater Southeast Irrigation Scheme. Last season, Tasmanian Irrigation delivered a record 100,593 megalitres of irrigation water, which was a 177 per cent increase on the water quality delivered last year. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=95.2_D=29.6_C=0.80]  

Irrigation water is rocket fuel for growth in the agriculture sector, and we are having more schemes nearing the launchpad. We have delivered $1.5 million to peak bodies and agricultural organisations for key projects that will build capacity in the sector through the Strategic Industry Partnership Program. 

Tasmania's wine sector is forecast to become the state's most significant economic driver over the coming 10 to 15 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=125.0_D=4.3_C=0.58]  years, and what a record vintage they are having right now [Bookmark: Phr8_O=130.3_D=27.8_C=0.84] . To further accelerate that growth, we have invested $1.5 million over three years so that the wine industry can forge ahead as it strengthens its global profile. Through our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future, we are working with farmers to ensure the sector continues to prosper. 

We are dedicated to helping our farmers grow their businesses and maximise the production and profitability of their operations. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=158.9_D=12.4_C=0.70]  Our farmers know that this government backs them, and we will always stand up and back in our farmers.


Dr Nicholas Gruen - Statement

[5.05 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) -  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=174.9_D=24.5_C=0.71] Deputy Speaker, it is my honour to rise tonight to read into the House a statement on behalf of Dr Nicholas Gruen. He writes:

As I conducted my review of the Macquarie Point Stadium, it became clear that Tasmanians face a very difficult dilemma which I have documented in my report. Tasmanian leaders should use the process now underway to focus squarely on that dilemma so they can deal with it in good faith. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=200.2_D=6.1_C=0.78]  Alas, some have found an easier course irresistible: to shoot the messenger rather than deal with the message. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=207.5_D=26.2_C=0.85] 

The AFL has insisted that a stadium be built and that it be built quickly enough for the project to be irreversible by the time the new team takes to the field. Rather than work through the issues with the community, the AFL quickly concluded that Macquarie Point would be a nice place for the stadium and this quickly crystallised into a ‘take-it-or-leave’ it proposition.

Macquarie Point would indeed be a fine location for a stadium. But prime waterfront land is a fine location for many things. What else might it be used for? This is the economist’s concept of opportunity cost which has gone missing in the official analysis of the project despite numerous attempts to raise it by independent analysts such as myself and the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) and in parliament.

There is also the financial cost of building the stadium. Whatever assurances might have been given, the stadium cannot be built without borrowing far more than $375 million. I came to that conclusion and carefully worked through the analysis in my report. The TPC came to the same conclusion. Some argue that their findings were driven by the numbers in my report. It is the way bona fide analysis works that a later analyst will look at other analysts’ work and work from the analysis it thinks is the soundest. This is what the TPC did.

In fact, however, most of the discrepancy between the TPC’s conclusions on project cost and the KPMG modelling directed by the government was driven by their own independent analysis. If you took all the figures it took from my report and substituted KPMG's estimates, their benefit cost ratio rises by just three cents in the dollar. As I've stressed before, the TPC's response to newer analysis contrasts starkly with KPMGs. As I documented in my letter to the Parliamentary Accounts Committee, there are mistakes and inadequacies in the KPMG report, but KPMG does not seem to have the professional pride necessary to provide a bona fide response to that critique by revising its numbers.

As I argued in my report, it would be foolish to suggest that decisions regarding the stadium should be based on technical analysis alone, without further recourse to the Tasmanian community. But Tasmania has had two independent messengers who have outlined problems that are still not being faced. One, the TPC received a legal letter and its statutory role may be sidelined from the process. In my case, it's suggested that my consultations with those opposed to the stadium somehow compromise my independence.

It is not only unremarkable for reviewers to consult with stakeholders with strong and diverse views - it is expected. It is also normal for this to occur before specific terms of reference have been announced. Since I sat on the Productivity Commission in the mid 1990s, I have done this with other commissioners and independent reviewers as a matter of course on numerous previous reviews. Indeed, once I was being considered as reviewer, I often asked people I met for their views on the subject.

If you ask any Productivity Commissioner, or, indeed, Tasmania's Saul Eslake, you will find this is entirely normal. It would never occur to anyone familiar with our trade that conversations regarding the subject of the inquiry would compromise the independence of an inquiry, including before terms of reference are finalised.

A final irony is how something which has been made to look untoward came to light. Realising I'd missed recording some stakeholder meetings when the report was first published, I updated it and published it online - a strange place to hide an embarrassing detail. 

Further, this questioning of my own independence comes after I documented in detail the ways in which the official analysis commissioned by the MPDC falls short of that standard on numerous occasions. To be specific the analysis of the stadium's visual impact, the site selection report and the optimistic assumptions and failure to consider opportunity costs in its economic analysis.

Tasmania deserves a decision-making process in which political leaders seek the public interest, informed by genuinely independent analysis - not one that sidelines inconvenient truths and undermines those who tell them.

Hear, hear, Dr Gruen.


ACS Education, Careers and Technology Summit

[5.10 p.m.]
Ms OGILVIE (Clark - Minister for Innovation, Science, and the Digital Economy) - Deputy Speaker, I had the great pleasure this morning to be invited to provide some opening remarks for the second ACS Education, Careers and Technology Summit. Funding for the summit is provided by ACS and coordinated by the Tasmanian branch. EdCAT is an educational career summit that brings together students, educators and tech professionals for a day of knowledge sharing, networking and inspiration. It has three streams: teachers, students and ICT professionals.

I was really delighted to see so many people there today. I think there were around 200 attendees and notably this year the student stream included year 11 and 12 students. I was very pleased to be able to go and chat with them and to see and meet some students from my old school, Hobart College, of which I am still a very proud alum. We had some amazing guest speakers. In relation to the 200 people who were gathered there today, it was very much a gathering of the cool kids - the kids are interested in tech - hello, an interesting team up there. Welcome, kids who are interested in tech and showing our commitment to advancing technology, fostering talent and strengthening Tasmania's position as a leader in the technology sector.

I would also like to acknowledge that Tyson Wienker, Head of School, ICT, UTAS; Chris Bracken, President of Tasmania ITE; and David Mills, President of Tasmania ICT; were present and are supportive of this. We had friends from interstate. As I said, we had the years 10, 11 and 12 joining us and it was just so wonderful to see everybody being so excited about the opportunities that the global technology and digital sector can provide to Tasmanians.

We had a guest speaker, Adam Spencer, and I am sure you will know him from his radio shows. He is not only a renowned mathematician and broadcaster, but passionate advocate for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) as well; and the presence of representatives from the education sector and peak industry bodies at this summit just really highlights the collaboration in the sector that we, as a government, are building upon. I was very pleased this year that we provided also some support to the event. We know that changing the way we do things in Tasmania is driven by STEM, which is one of the reasons I am so supportive of the Tasmanian University STEM precinct project. We have to lift science, technology and engineering across our state, particularly for our children.

I see Michael Ferguson nodding. I think you have some skills in that yourself there, do you not, Michael? As technology advances, opportunities advance as well. We have our new cyber security strategy that we have rolled out across the government with our cyber hubs, cyber resilience. Protecting critical services will happen, but we need to grow our pool of cyber security experts, which we are doing really well through TAFE, through university and with apprenticeships and opportunities on the job. We are building an environment where innovation can thrive. The utilisation of digital technologies will help to improve our lives, our businesses, our community services and what we love to do as humans, and that is to connect with one another. 

The cornerstone of all of this is the Tasmanian government's advanced technologies industry strategy, of which I am very proud. We announced that in the election. We have had some really good feedback on that from industry in particular. It is designed to accelerate innovation, attract investment and support high growth sectors. We have our emerging space sector, which is phenomenal. University of Tasmania School of Astrophysics owns an array of radio telescopes nationally across the nation. They are in partnership with us and a joint venture with Hensoldt for research on space situational awareness. They have eyes on the sky and they are helping to clean up the space junk. It is very, very cool. We want to continue to foster that collaboration. 

In the last few seconds I have remaining, I will again underscore the UTAS STEM precinct as central to everything that we need to do. We had two prize winners of whom we are very proud. The first winner of the 2024 Primary Digital Technologies Teacher of the Year was Brett Mullins from Somerset Primary School, and the 2024 Secondary Digital Technologies Teacher of the Year was Rob Tulloch from Hobart College - as I said, as an alum of Hobart college, I am super proud of that school. They have been working on programs like Devil Robotics, Smartbots, co-authoring student-centred Lego robotics books, leading professional learning for educators and fostering real world STEM applications through competitions and community engagement. The sister state relationship between Tasmania and Washington State is going to be very important to you.

Seymour - Invasive Fallow Deer
[5.15 p.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Deputy Speaker, oh dear. Yet again, the Liberals have completely neglected to take proper action on invasive species management and to protect our unique natural places in Lutruwita/Tasmania. We are devastated for the Seymour Community Action Group, Quentin Smith and his crew who have seen their wetlands restoration project damaged by invasive deer. For decades the Seymour community have been restoring their local wetlands. They have been removing gorse and replanting native vegetation. This community has done such a tremendous and high quality degree of work that their wetland site has actually recently been included into the bordering conservation area. 

Despite the 2024 State of Environment report calling for the removal of the archaic colonial protections placed on fallow deer, and the proper resourcing of biosecurity efforts and the restoration and monitoring of critical wetland ecosystems, the Liberals have done nothing, so the problems continue to proliferate. The community should not be copping the costs of this government's negligence to manage invasive species. 

A few weeks ago, the Greens tabled in this place a petition on behalf of the community in Mole Creek, and that was for seeking a special fund for landowners adversely affected by the damage that was specifically caused by rabbits, but there should be a fund for all impacts by invasive species that are not being adequately managed. This government is yet to respond, but we hope they do so positively because the impacts that we are seeing across our communities is far too much. No, money cannot compensate for the years of hard work that have been lost and for volunteer work that has been lost in cases such as that at Seymour, but at the very least it can ensure that people are not out of pocket for remediation in extreme circumstances. 

Not only are the Liberals evasive on supporting landowners disproportionately affected by the damage caused by invasive species, they also seem to have abandoned efforts to safeguard the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (TWWHA). In 2021, the Tasmanian government received $440,000 from the federal government through the Australian Heritage Grants Project. This was for a project to survey and eradicate deer within the Walls of Jerusalem National Park. Come 2025, the Tasmanian government was again successful in being awarded funding through that same [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=29.4_C=0.82]  program, but this time they applied for and were granted less money which is to be thinly spread across deer and cat monitoring and weed control in key areas. 
In 2021, the funding was awarded for the surveying and eradication of deer within the Walls of Jerusalem National Park. This time that funding is just for undertaking monitoring and to detect deer presence and assess the impacts. This current project is for monitoring deer, it is for cats and it is also for foxglove, which we welcome [Bookmark: Phr3_O=59.8_D=29.9_C=0.86]  the new listing of. We have to ensure that there is support to undertake the management now that it is listed. We have to make sure that there is funding to go all the way to protecting the outstanding, universal, natural and cultural values of the TWWHA.

Not to do so simply suggests that the Liberals might just be walking away from the Tasmanian Wild Fallow Deer Implementation Strategy of 2022-2027, which prioritises eradicating deer from the World Heritage Area national parks, not [Bookmark: Phr4_O=89.9_D=29.9_C=0.68]  just monitoring the destruction they are causing. Climate change is predicted to facilitate the further expansion of the deer population into the Tasmanian wilderness, but this government is as silent on climate action as they are on the 2024 - 2029 Cat Management Plan. I checked again just before coming in here and it still does not exist. Speaking of the Cat Management Plan, what is the government doing to ensure the wildlife carers and cat-management facilities have the funding that they need to support and comply with the Cat Management Act of 2009?

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=120.0_D=30.0_C=0.77] We are hearing stories of cat-management facilities with waiting lists of over six months. They are simply being overwhelmed. They are being overwhelmed by the people who are doing the right thing under the act and turning in unwanted cats or kittens to the registered facilities. What is the government currently doing to enforce its own legislation and penalise those who do not do the right thing, who are doing the wrong thing and dumping or abandoning cats and kittens and making that problem worse? 

The Liberals must come clean with their long-term plan to protect the [Bookmark: Phr6_O=150.3_D=23.7_C=0.77]  wilderness; come clean on deer management and eradication, and on other invasive species such as cats and foxglove. The Greens are again calling on the Liberal government to urgently step up and take action on invasives. That includes providing support for landowners and community groups and investing in proper biosecurity measures for the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area.


Minister for Health - Thanks
St Helens Pre-Dental Clinic
 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=175.3_D=2.5_C=0.55] 
[5.20 p.m.]
Ms BUTLER (Lyons) -  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=181.5_D=3.6_C=0.60] Deputy Speaker, I rise on the Adjournment and I am going to start [Bookmark: Phr9_O=186.1_D=28.2_C=0.68]  off on a nice note. I would like to thank minister Petrusma, the Minister for Health. I had a constituent inquiry last week. It was a health constituent inquiry, and it was quite a complex case involving a child. We delicately passed that through to the minister's office and the advice that I have had from that family is that the child will be having surgery next week.  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=215.2_D=2.2_C=0.58] That is really important work, so thank you very much for that, minister. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=218.4_D=9.4_C=0.79]  There is a lot of work sometimes that goes on behind the scenes in this House, is there not, between different members picking up the phone? There is a lot we can solve that way. It does not have to be thrown out over t [Bookmark: Phr12_O=229.1_D=7.1_C=0.74] he media and other channels. 

I would like to talk about St Helens [Bookmark: Phr13_O=237.9_D=23.6_C=0.74]  pre-dental clinic, or lack thereof at the moment. Traditionally, in St Helens, there is a private dentist and also a free dental clinic that travels to St Helens once a month. People make bookings through the clinic in Launceston. It is an outreach service of sorts. I have learnt from some different constituents in the community that that service has either not been regular or is ceasing to exist. People in St Helens wanting to access that free dental clinic are having to travel into Launceston, which is quite difficult if you do not have a car. It is a two-hour drive and four-hour return trip.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=287.3_D=14.3_C=0.75] I am going to read into the Hansard some of the statements I have received from community members because their words explain quite well the situation that some of those people are in. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=302.4_D=2.6_C=0.82]  One gentleman wrote to me.

I broke a tooth several months ago. I rang a place in Launceston to book into the free dentist that used to come once a month to St Helens. We are told it doesn't come to St Helens now and I would have to travel to Launceston. 

Another gentleman I spoke to, well, he sent this through:

I have just found out that the dentist in St Helens no longer accepts vouchers from pensioners and Centrelink cardholders. This changed six months ago. I am forced to travel to Launceston for free dental treatment now. 

From another constituent:

The dental bus attends the school regularly, which is positive, which is very good, but there is nothing for us adults. The dentist is so expensive and I do not have private health.

We will be asking some more questions around those dental services for St Helens and checking whether there has been shortages or stoppages of those free clinics into other more remote communities in our electorate. 

On a positive note, Deputy Speaker, my office has conducted an Easter colouring-in competition. We have had different schools from around the area all send in their beautiful artwork for that competition. Tomorrow, we are going to announce that and attend the school where the student who has won that is going to be. We are really looking forward to that. Thank you, and happy Easter, everybody.


Gerard Castles - Tribute

[5.24. p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Deputy Speaker, I rise tonight with a heavy heart to commemorate the life of Gerard Castles. Those of us who had the great pleasure, the joy and the fortune of knowing Gerard were shocked to hear of his unexpected death last weekend. It was a body blow for many who have worked, campaigned, socialised and called Gerard friend over many years. We send our hearts out to his wife, Shayne, and his children, Conor and Sarah, who knew and loved him best. Our condolences also to his closest friends and companions, fellow shack owners on Bruny Island and the Dennes Point community in collective. 

Gerard did many things in his too-short life, including working as a strategic communication specialist. He had a mighty intellect and he used it for good. Gerard was handpicked by Jim Bacon to be one of the 22 special members to lead the Tasmania Together process that started in 1999 and ran for over a decade, tasked with developing a plan for the state's future. In Gerard's words, it asked Tasmanians to dream of a future they wanted to have and began a radical re-engineering of the way Tasmanian society worked.

Ultimately, he said for all its flaws, it helped the state change forever in a positive way. Gerard was perfect for that work. He had a special way of dealing with people, really a gift. He could bring groups together from all sorts of spheres with a boundless energy and enthusiasm. He never stopped giving to the community throughout his life. He was on the front line of so many fights to make sure this beautiful place, Lutruwita, is looked after. From his childhood in the north-west, he had a lifelong love of the Highland Lakes and was a great trout fisherman.

He had a special deep connection with his beloved Walls of Jerusalem National Park and was a champion in the fight to keep helicopter tourism out of the World Heritage Area. He encouraged the many groups fighting to keep Lake Malbena development-free and revelled in telling the stories of the magic of visiting the Halls Hut, gushing with pride about spending a night in the Hut with friends and their children. Those who continued the defence of Lake Malbena will thank him for his constant support and hold him in their hearts.

In general, Gerard though was a quiet activist, but the Tasmania Together process in the fight against big Salmon forced him out the front. I last saw Gerard a few weeks ago on the beach at Verona Sands, surrounded by hundreds of local people protesting at the failure of the government to protect our marine environment. What a terrific last memory. It is one of so many I have with him over the last 10 years. The whole 10 years I have been in parliament, Gerard has been in the trenches, never giving up, strategising and supporting the community campaign to defend our oceans and channels from the pollution of industrial salmon farming. Gerard was a great help to the collective work of the Greens over many years as well. He always supported brave voices and anyone who spoke up against corruption and self-interest.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=10.8_D=29.8_C=0.84] I want to read some words now from what I believe is the last on-camera interview that Gerard did late last year. He said:

As a kid I wandered through the bush, and gradually over time we started to go out overnight up into Cradle. I developed a love for the outdoors. I think it was the freedom, a sense of otherness. There was something about being out there that you were in contact with something special. You don't have to necessarily be an environmentalist. You can just love being out in the wild places of [Bookmark: Phr3_O=40.9_D=10.7_C=0.74]  Tasmania - fishing, deer hunting, travelling around, walking. 

I think it is incredibly important, it is part of what makes us us. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=52.4_D=17.4_C=0.89]  Place gives us soul. A lot of us struggle to find the words to describe what it means, but we know when we lose it. You feel it when it is threatened or lost. It is important for us to fight for it, to preserve it for multiple generations.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=71.2_D=4.4_C=0.71] Well, dear Gerard, we commit [Bookmark: Phr6_O=77.2_D=2.3_C=0.84]  to keep fighting in your spirit [Bookmark: Phr7_O=81.2_D=1.5_C=0.66] , with you in our hearts to guide us. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=83.6_D=4.3_C=0.52]  Vale Gerard Castles.

Members - Hear, hear.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Documents

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=89.7_D=25.9_C=0.88] [5.29 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - In relation to the motion moved by Mr Bayley and passed by the House yesterday on 9 April, I can advise as follows. In the public interest, government is unable to table all the requested documents in relation to Cabinet-in-confidence materials or legally privileged documents. The Project of State Significance process is an active legal process between two parties.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=116.3_D=8.9_C=0.81] Given the broadness of the motion and the limited time allowed by the House to respond to the motion, the government has interpreted the motion in the following manner [Bookmark: Phr11_O=126.6_D=24.4_C=0.84] . First, the timeframe and scope of the motion is from 31 March 2025 to the point the motion was moved in the House by the member for Clark on 9 April 2025 at 4.32 p.m. Second, the intent of the motion is to focus on the Draft Integrated Assessment Report and the government's assessment and consideration of next steps. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=151.8_D=6.6_C=0.53]  Third, under paragraph (1)(a), the correspondence is taken to mean with or from MinterEllison. Fourth, under  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=159.2_D=10.0_C=0.72] paragraph (1)(b), the correspondence is taken to mean with or from the Macquarie Point Development Corporation.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=170.9_D=19.4_C=0.79] Relevant agencies have given this request the highest priority and undertaken a central search of all records held. If the information provided is insufficient, then a longer time period will need to be sought. I table those documents that I am able to table. I thank the House.


 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=190.8_D=4.0_C=0.48]  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=206.0_D=1.0_C=0.80] Macquarie Point Stadium - Cost

[5.31 p.m.]
Mr JENNER (Lyons) -  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=209.2_D=15.3_C=0.76] Deputy Speaker, as I said earlier, I have been asked by my constituents about the stadium. I know we have had a discussion today and I appreciate that. I know there are strong views both ways, and is that not the great thing about democracy [Bookmark: Phr18_O=225.3_D=3.8_C=0.94]  - that we can express those views and still get on with each other.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=231.5_D=14.0_C=0.85] The government was asking, in my opinion, the Tasmanian people to put their hand in their pocket to pay up to a billion dollars. Surely in some ways we should ask the Tasmanian people whether they want to do that or not. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=247.8_D=8.2_C=0.50]  To clarify a point: Saul Eslake recommended Dr Gruen, not the JLN, and it is a shame [Bookmark: Phr21_O=258.0_D=13.0_C=0.65]  member Abetz has left because he does make me laugh when he is talking about experts lacking common sense. 

If I am wrong in saying that he said that, I apologise, but that is what he implied [Bookmark: Phr22_O=272.6_D=6.4_C=0.54]  when he drew a simile between facts and finance and toads, smoking and rivers [Bookmark: Phr23_O=281.4_D=6.3_C=0.84] . The real question, whether you believe the experts or not, is can we afford the stadium? [Bookmark: Phr24_O=288.2_D=10.1_C=0.78]  Can Tasmanians who are struggling to put a roof over their head or food on their table not take the priority over that stadium?
 [Bookmark: Phr25_O=300.3_D=3.8_C=0.31] 

Answer to Question - Pelvic Pain Foundation - PEPP Talk Funding
Leonie Hiscutt - Tribute

[5.32 p.m.]
Mrs PETRUSMA (Franklin - Minister for Health) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to provide a response to the member for Bass, Ms Rosol, to her question today in Question Time. I advise the member that I have sought information from the Minister for Education, and I am advised that the Pelvic Pain Foundation of Australia has previously provided the Periods, Pain and Endometriosis Program to 40 Tasmanian schools per year for two years.

The funding was provided by both the state and federal governments as part of the National Action Plan for Endometriosis, and was provided on a transitional basis to allow the Department for Education, Children and Young People to develop its own model for 2025 onwards.

I am advised that the department has now developed its own program that will be used moving forward, which is in the final stages of completion and will be ready for delivery in mid-2025. As this program relates to an initiative being delivered in schools, any further questions will need to be directed to the Minister for Education.

I also want to pay tribute to the Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council, the honourable Leonie Hiscutt, who has marked her last day in the Tasmanian parliament today. I remember well in 2013 when we were all out and about in the Montgomery electorate, doorknocking away and visiting different stakeholders, and just how delighted we all were when Mrs Hiscutt was elected in 2013.

What I have to say about Leonie is that she is a proud north-west coaster who has now served the Montgomery electorate with distinction since her election in 2013. She has spent the last 12 years fighting for and championing for the Montgomery electorate. 

Mrs Hiscutt was appointed as Leader of Government Business in the Legislative Council in 2017, where, as the Premier stated in his media release tonight:

She has been an outstanding leader, managing the complexities that we often find in the upper House with grace, and at all times engaging respectfully with her colleagues.

Mrs Hiscutt will retire on 23 May, at which point she will be the longest-serving female leader in Tasmania's Legislative Council history. I pay tribute to that great milestone that she has achieved during her time as Leader of Government Business.

At the same time, what I know about Mrs Hiscutt, the member for Montgomery, is that being a local member was always her priority as well. From having visited different stakeholders or different events or going out with her over the years, I have seen firsthand the deep respect, and what I would actually say is great affection, that members of her community have for her.

I find it a bit sad to think this is Leonie's last day. However, we wish her all the best, because it has been a great privilege to work with Leonie. She has supported our Liberal government to deliver a strong economy, create jobs and support regional Tasmania. The Tasmanian government and I wish her all the best for the future.

UNESCO City of Literature Listing for Hobart
LitFest

[5.36 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about literature. Specifically, I want to talk about the UNESCO City of Literature listing for Hobart, and LitFest, a festival hosted by the Salamanca Arts Centre that celebrates all things literature in Hobart.

First, the UNESCO City of Literature gong that Hobart got several years ago means that we join cities such as Baghdad, Barcelona, Grenada, Lahore, Melbourne, Rio and Seattle. It is part of UNESCO's Creative Cities Network. UNESCO is the United Nation's educational, scientific and cultural organisation. The Creative Cities Network is basically a program to recognise cities in seven creative fields: craft and folk art, design, film, gastronomy, literature, music and the media arts.

When it comes to Cities of Literature, there are 53 cities all around the world, in 39 countries and on six continents. In 2003 Hobart was added to the list. It is because we meet seven set criteria. Things like:

the quality, quantity and diversity of publishing;
the quality, quantity and diversity of education programs about literature;
that literature plays an important role in our city;
that hosting literature festivals and events is a feature of our city;
that there is an existence of libraries;
that there is an involvement in the publishing sector; and 
there is active involvement in traditional and new media promoting literature.

It is fabulous that Hobart got that gong because we have a long history of literature. I remember the name that is etched in my brains as a child: the bookshop Ellison Hawker. I used to go with my father to Ellison Hawker's farm at Kempton, and he was one of the booksellers here.

Obviously, we have the State Library and at the moment we have an incredible facility being developed at MONA, which presents the exciting future for literature going forward. We also have some incredible independent bookstores like Fullers, the Hobart Bookshop, Cracked and Spineless, that sells second-hand books and has a fantastic second-hand and Tasmanian section, and we have your average commercial retailers.

When it comes to publishers, we have some incredible publications: Tasmania 40⁰ South has been around for a long time, and ISLAND magazine is a great community-based production that is delivering four editions a year of writing and the like.

We obviously have a long history of Palawa storytellers in this city and in this state. We have some really interesting emerging artists and platforms for people such as the recently-established zine fair where you have people like Jon Kudelka and Josh Santospirito leading the way with zines, the new creation, really quite funky and quite interesting artistic and literature creations.

We have writers both historical and contemporary, and we are incredibly lucky. Amongst our writers we have Vogel Award winners, Stella Prize winners, Commonwealth Writers Prize winners, the Prime Minister's Literary Award winners, a Booker Prize winner, and the Baillie Gifford Prize winner. It is people like Ben Walter, Richard Flanagan, Katherine Scholes, Sarah Day, James Dryburgh and that absolute treasure of our literary scene, Pete Hay.

Art and literature is important for something that is close to my heart: for conservation. The Tasmanian Land Conservancy publishes books like Breathing Space, Bob Brown publishing books on Recherche Bay and the Styx Self-drive Guide - really important tools to get people out there.

Closer to my heart, my wife, Stephenie, is an author. She wrote a book called 'The People's Park' about the Domain and land use conflict at the Domain. She wrote a biography on Claudio Alcorso called 'Colour and Movement'. Claudio Alcorso was the person who established Moorilla which is now MONA.

The LitFest is hosted by the Salamanca Art Centre. It is on until 12 April, just this weekend. On Thursday last week I went to the opening to hear Peter Timms give a really meandering presentation about how we became a city of literature and how we compare to other cities. There have been talks, play readings and other things. On Saturday it concludes with an indie author book fair. I encourage people to get along there, and while we celebrate literature here, I want to finish with a sobering statistic and remind people that the Grattan Institute showed that 62 per cent of adults have a proficient literacy level. It is not good enough. We need to do more and organisations like 26Ten do a fantastic effort in that space.


Macquarie Point Stadium and AFL Team

[5.41 p.m.]
Mr BEHRAKIS (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I would first like to echo the minister, Mrs Petrusma's tribute to the service of Leonie Hiscutt in this place and for the people of Tasmania.

I am rising tonight to make sure it is clear for Tasmanians and there are no misunderstandings. No Macquarie Point Stadium means no AFL team. No AFL team means no high-performance centre. It is as simple as that. That is the fact. The high-performance centre means no investment by the AFL into grassroots community and football.
Let us be clear again, for the people in and around the Kingborough area, the people in and around Nelson: a vote for the incumbent member for Nelson is a vote against the high-performance centre. It is as simple as that. Only a vote for the hardworking Liberal candidate, Marcus Vermey, will deliver a high-performance centre for the people of Nelson. That is over $75 million of investment in Kingborough and Nelson that is at stake by the AFL into grassroots community sport. Boys and girls wearing our team colours, cheering for our team and singing our team songs, a decade of work, determination, perseverance for Tasmania to have its own team, all at stake. It would mean over 200,000 foundation members bitterly disappointed and an opportunity lost that we most likely would never see again in our lifetime.

The stadium is what sets up our Tasmania Devils Football Club for future success. Tasmanians deserve a team that is successful and sustainable, and that is exactly what the stadium will do. The people of Nelson deserve an investment into that high-performance centre that can only be realised with the stadium. Clearly some are against this, campaigning to see Tasmania's time to take the stage in our national competition become no more than a wasted effort, destroying the dreams of Tasmanians, in particularly young Tasmanians who have held dear the hope that we can finally get this job done. 

For example, one of my very good friends has a young son who, whilst very athletic, up until recently had no particular interest in a particular sport, but when the JackJumpers came on the scene, and the investment in MyState arena, he is now obsessed with basketball. He gets up first thing in the morning to practice. Whenever I go and visit, he is showing me videos of his games and wanting to take me outside to show off his skills and his training. Every day he is excited at the idea that one day he might become a JJ. We could have that same ambition, that same dream for our young kids wanting to get into the Tassie AFL team. It is something that they deserve, it is something that we are fighting on this side and we are committed to delivering. 

We are 100 per cent committed to delivering that transformational infrastructure at Macquarie Point and in the high-performance centre. That is important infrastructure that is multi-purpose, capable of hosting a range of sports, major concerts and events, and of course, the home for our AFL team. It is infrastructure that will create thousands of jobs and drive economic activity for decades to come - not next year, not the year after, but for decades. It provides that aspiration for generations of young Tasmanians.

We are 100 per cent focused and committed on delivering this.  We are committed to deliver the stadium, we are committed to deliver the team and we are committed to deliver that high-performance centre. For those people living in Nelson, only a vote for Marcus Vermey can deliver that. A vote for anyone else will ensure that that dream is dashed for so many Tasmanians, I believe, for generations.


Northern Tasmanian Football League 2025 Season

[5.45 p.m.]
Mr FAIRS (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about the return of the Northern Tasmanian Football League for season 2025. The NTFA, as many know, has undergone a dramatic transformation and restructure with the introduction of a Premier League division: division 1 men, division 1 women and division 2 men. Last Saturday, my wife, Jo, and I headed to Lilydale to watch the Demons host George Town, two teams that had not played each other for 40 years, which is incredible. 

I have to say that it was mind blowing when we turned up to see the turnout for this particular match. I have never seen cars six deep on the hill at Lilydale, but that was the case. It was packed. Gate takings for this match surpassed finals matches that have been played there. The bar did a roaring trade, as did the canteen, which actually sold out twice for food. They had to go to the local IGA to get more supplies to feed the masses, which is just fantastic to see. No, I was not partaking, I was not the cause of that, but it was wonderful to see. I must congratulate George Town for winning the 2s, but it was Lilydale who claimed victory in the seniors. I had the honours of presenting the Tamar Cup reunited. Now, this is what they used to play for back in the day when they once met.

I commend the two clubs for bringing this cup back. It is given to the winner in the seniors game the first time that they play each other in a season. The Dees took it this time, but I am sure the George Town Saints will certainly bite back next year. I think it is wonderful that the two clubs can actually get together and work together for the betterment of the game to reinstall this rivalry.

It was wonderful to see so many kids out there running around, kicking the footy and things like that during the breaks - any opportunity they could to get on the oval and boot the footy around. I have no doubt that when our Devils get closer and closer to fruition, it is just going to boost the game participation even more.

I will finish off by wishing the teams the very best of luck in the newly formed Premier League, which starts this coming Saturday - although, I have to say, local and country footy up north is alive and well. It is great to see.

The House adjourned at 5.48 p.m.

QUESTIONS

Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.02 a.m.]
Happy birthday to you, honourable Speaker. We hope to, as always, make sure we behave ourselves.

Premier, you have revealed this week that your leadership is all about privatisation and that you have a plan to sell Tasmania's future. We only need to look across the country to see the disaster that privatisation has meant and what a disaster it will be for Tasmania's renewable energy assets. When the South Australian Liberals privatised their state's public energy assets under a long term lease - exactly what you are proposing for TasNetworks - prices skyrocketed. That is exactly what will happen here. Imposing South Australian power prices in Tasmania would see the average household power bill increase by more than $1100. For small businesses, bills would increase by more than $4000. Why should Tasmanian families and small businesses pay thousands of dollars more for their power because you wrecked our budget?

ANSWER

Many happy returns, honourable Speaker.

I thank the member for his question. I will start on the topic of leadership. What we saw yesterday from the Leader of the Opposition was a scare campaign and an example that you do not have the ticker - what it takes for the top job. That was evident in the faces over there.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, thank you, members.

Mr ROCKLIFF - If it was not for the young gun who joined the Chamber yesterday, you would not have even got a line in the Mercury, frankly, from what was a pathetic state of the state address in reply. What was of note, however, in the state of the state reply is the fact that you want the GBEs to -

Mr WINTER - Point of order, honourable Speaker, given the Premier has lost track anyway, Standing Order 45, relevance.

The SPEAKER - A not unexpected point of order.

Mr WINTER - The question is specifically about privatisation of energy assets and the impact on prices for Tasmanians. Can he answer the question?
Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I beg your pardon, members on my right. I will draw the Premier to the question which was, whilst it did have a preamble, about Tasmanians paying because of decisions of government.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Leadership is very important. I had been in opposition for 12 years and we looked forward to the Premier's state of the state address. Equally as important for the team was the Leader of the Opposition's reply to the state of the state address. There was no direction apart from, of course, more profits for the GBEs, which can only mean two things -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left will be silent. I remind the Premier that I have drawn him to the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - which can only mean two things: sacking workers from GBEs or increased charges of levies for Tasmanians.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I know you are sensitive about it -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order and the Premier will address the question. I beg your pardon, Mr Willie? The House will come to order. The Premier will address the question or resume his seat.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I know you are sensitive about it, but when your leader goes out to the Parliament Lawns today bumping his gums once again, he needs to -

The SPEAKER - Premier, if you are not going to address the question, I will ask you to resume your seat.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. I do not need advice from members on my left. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - What he has for GBEs, higher charges for Tasmanians, higher levies for Tasmanians or sacking workers in GBEs -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. 

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - The Premier could not even defend his policy from two days ago. I am going to ask the question again: why should Tasmanian families and small businesses pay thousands of dollars more for their power because you wrecked our budget?

The SPEAKER - The supplementary is in order because it was the original question. As a supplementary, it does not allow an awful lot of latitude. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - I want to talk about 48-hour policies. We saw the Hydro policy, the gutting Hydro policy in the election campaign. I do not think it even lasted 48 hours, it was almost 24 hours, in actual fact, such was your pathetic -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order. All of you. Sorry, there are members on the crossbench who have been behaving themselves, I apologise to all of you. Everybody else will come to order. This is not acceptable.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I agree, honourable Speaker, and I am trying to get a word in and clearly explain to the Leader of the Opposition that we have a very strong agenda for Tasmanians, where we are slashing red tape for businesses so they can grow and where we can, quite sensibly, create a future fund from putting asset sales on the table. Why would you not do that work?

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the supplementary question has expired.
———————————————————
Recognition of Visitors

The SPEAKER - Before calling the leader on his second question, I acknowledge in the gallery group three from the legal studies classes at Hobart College. I am not sure if the same staff have been for each of the three sessions, but you may have seen an escalation in interesting behaviour. Whilst that may be more fun for you, I am not having a great day with it, so we will see how it goes. Thank you very much for joining us.

Members - Hear, hear.
———————————————————
Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation - Effect on Power Prices

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF - 

[10.08 a.m.]
The Premier did not answer my question, so I am going to ask a similar one. 

Imposing South Australian power prices in Tasmania would see the average household power bill increase by more than $1100. For small businesses that would be $4000. Why should Tasmanian families and small businesses pay thousands of dollars more for their power because you wrecked our budget?

ANSWER

Thank you, and in answering the question, I am afraid, honourable Speaker, I do have to give another history lesson to the Leader of the Opposition.

The SPEAKER - As long as it is relevant to the question, Premier, that will be fine.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Very relevant. Tasmanians will remember a time when not only were frontline services slashed because of economic incompetence, not only did we lose 10,000 jobs because you shut down an industry, but power prices went up 65 per cent under the Labor-Greens government. Do not lecture this side of the House on power prices, especially a day after your shadow energy spokesperson clearly signalled that renewable energy dividends are dead under Labor. Quite frankly, that is disgraceful when it comes to the fact that Hydro will always be owned by Tasmanians -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - so we can reach in and support Tasmanians with their power bills, even though we have the lowest regulated power prices in the nation.

We recognised that Tasmanians were doing it tough in the cost-of-living crisis and they are still doing it tough for the economic mismanagement of the federal Labor government when it comes to interest rates, which was outlined by the member for Bass yesterday in his contribution. That has been hurting people, so why would we not reach in and support Tasmanians with the renewable energy dividends and credit their power bills when they are doing it tough?

Ms Finlay - They are only doing it tough because of your lack of energy reform.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Bass.

Mr ROCKLIFF - That will be gone under -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader, I just called you.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Should, heaven forbid, the energy spokesperson become the Energy minister, then you can kiss the renewable energy dividends goodbye.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Bass.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It is very sensible to take a constructive and measured approach to this discussion. Why would you not? In the interests of Tasmanians getting the best service delivery possible, why would you not look at all government businesses to see how they can be better value for the Tasmanian people. That body of work will be done. At the end of the day, there might only be two or three GBEs that we sell -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I understand how tempting that was to interject, everyone, but the House will come to order. Premier, I draw you to the question. You have 10 seconds left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - and invest into a future fund, but we have to do that work very sensibly in a calm and measured manner.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Mr WINTER - Coming from the Premier's answer, he said he might only sell two or three Tasmania assets, presumably energy assets. Can the Premier name one state or territory where the sale of energy assets has been a good thing for the people of that state?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, minister Abetz, I do not need you to add to the question for the Premier who has the call on an accepted supplementary.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Clark, you will be warned next time. It is not funny. I could kick you out right now without any more warnings.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We all recall the 65 per cent power-price hikes -

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker.

Mr ROCKLIFF - No, no, you cannot have it both ways, mate.

The SPEAKER - I will hear the point of order.  [Bookmark: _Hlk192154411] I make the decision about who gets heard.

Mr WINTER - The question was specifically: can he name one state or territory where energy sell-offs have been a good thing?

The SPEAKER - I draw the Premier to the supplementary question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - What I put first and foremost is Tasmania and Tasmanians, and that is why -

Members interjecting.
The SPEAKER - Order, Leader of Opposition Business.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I will never forget - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Lyons.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I will never forget the impact that you had when you lot were in government when the Liberals -

The SPEAKER - The Premier will direct his responses through the Chair. He can look at me when he says that.

Mr ROCKLIFF - When the  [Bookmark: _Hlk192154519] Labor-Greens government were in power - now they are the Labor-Greens opposition - 65 per cent price hike. In real terms, it has been 15 per cent -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the supplementary question has expired. The Premier will resume his seat. Members on my left will be silent.


Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

 [Bookmark: _Hlk192154619] [10.13 a.m.]
Your decision to consider privatising all but one of Tasmania's government businesses has been widely condemned. You have no mandate from Tasmanians for this reckless move. You often seem to forget your government is in minority. Let us help you with the brutal mathematics. The Greens are fundamentally opposed to privatisation. We have heard Labor, Kristie Johnston and Andrew Jenner categorically oppose it too. That is 17. Mr O'Byrne has expressed scepticism and we are yet to hear from Mr Garland. It is looking like your sell-off agenda may be dead on arrival.

Will you read the writing on the wall and abandon this push before you waste precious time and money? If not, will you rule out making any deals to secure the votes you need for privatisation?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. I will not be taking advice from the Greens. The Labor Party took advice from the Greens between 2010 and 2014 and that did not go well -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Members on my right can also mind their behaviour today.

Mr ROCKLIFF - and here we are 11 years later, you are still a policy-free zone apart from wanting to charge levies - increased charges for Tasmanians -
Dr WOODRUFF - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The Premier is talking to the Opposition. The Greens asked this question. Has he done the numbers and is he going to do any deals?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The only person the Premier should be responding to is the House through the Speaker. I will draw him to the question. Who he physically turns to is a matter for himself, I am afraid.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, honourable Speaker, for that sensible ruling. I am going to continue doing what is best for Tasmania, putting bold reforms on the table in the best interests of Tasmania.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Interjections from brand new members should be taken very carefully.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Alright, I am not going to squib it. I am not going to have a scare campaign over here because when the Leader of the Opposition over there -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Franklin, Ms Brown, and member for Clark, Mr Willie. Mr Willie, you are actually now warned for your first warning. I suggest your interjections, if you are going to make them, be much shorter than that.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition squibbed it. He had the opportunity to stand up and take a lead from the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI), which actually wanted some constructive debate. We are about putting bold reform on the table for measured discussion. Here you are at the crossbench where you can have some influence on that policy. I recognise that, as you all did last year, where it was the most constructive parliament in over two decades and you can still - apart from you lot - you can still have an influence in a constructive way on the outcome of what I put on the table on Tuesday [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.7_D=23.2_C=0.75]  for the benefit of the people you claim to represent and all of us represent. Why would we not? 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left, I cannot hear the answer. I am sure Dr Woodruff would like to hear it so she can do her supplementary.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=59.2_D=16.2_C=0.80] Mr ROCKLIFF - Why would we not, in a very sensible and measured way, want the community to be engaged in a discussion on bold policy reforms that can set up Tasmania for the future?  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=76.4_D=3.7_C=0.64] You squibbed it. Others may well be more constructive [Bookmark: Phr6_O=82.2_D=1.0_C=0.20] , but this lot over here chose not to be in government.
 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=83.5_D=26.8_C=0.73] 
The SPEAKER - The time to answer the question has expired. 
Premier and Leader of the Opposition, you are both granted a great deal of latitude because of your positions, but both of you will adhere to the Standing Orders. I do not mind throwing a leader out. I will hear the Leader of the Greens on her supplementary question.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - Speaker, the Premier did not go anywhere near the question on the numbers. You do not have the numbers to pass this legislation, it appears.  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=111.2_D=2.0_C=0.67] What are you going to do? Are you going to abandon it [Bookmark: Phr9_O=114.2_D=6.4_C=0.55]  or are you going to do deals to get it passed?

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=123.2_D=9.2_C=0.56] The SPEAKER - I have an understanding. I think the Premier has made it clear he will do whatever it takes. If the Premier wishes to add to that, he may do so. Otherwise the supplementary has probably been answered already.  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=134.4_D=1.3_C=0.67] Premier, are you comfortable with your answer?

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=137.8_D=12.3_C=0.41] Mr ROCKLIFF - I am comfortable with my answer because I have just said we would work together. 

Dr Woodruff - That was not the question. You did not go anywhere near it.

Mr Rockliff - I thought you wanted a minority parliament; now you do not.

The SPEAKER - There is no conversation across the Chamber. Dr Woodruff will have time for another question.


Short-Stay Accommodation Levy

Mr O'BYRNE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.19 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=151.4_D=6.5_C=0.79]  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=159.8_D=8.8_C=0.77] Before the last state election, your party promised to introduce a short-stay levy. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=169.2_D=14.1_C=0.86]  It is becoming impossible to ignore the impact short-stay accommodation is having on housing availability for Tasmanians. The latest data shows that over the last two years the number of properties in Tasmania being used as short-stay accommodation has increased by 43 per cent.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=183.6_D=22.5_C=0.83] This week you have announced an efficiency unit, a freeze on hiring and potential asset sales. There has been no mention of this promised levy - at a time when Tasmanian renters are struggling like never before and the budget is in the state that it is in. What is the delay? When does your government plan to implement a short-stay levy?

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=215.8_D=27.2_C=0.88] ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. The sentiment in the question was really around the challenges with housing and ensuring that we have enough supply of housing to ensure that, in my humble opinion, and I believe everyone in this Chamber, every single Tasmanian should have that fundamental right to be safe  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=243.8_D=1.3_C=0.81] and have a roof over their heads. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=246.4_D=15.6_C=0.89] 

We have made some significant inroads when it comes to the 4000 homes over the course of the last few years on our target towards 10,000 homes by 2032.  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=263.8_D=11.4_C=0.67] We also have new ideas. We are cutting red tape to ensure that housing supply increases. We have a federal housing initiative [Bookmark: Phr21_O=276.4_D=0.9_C=0.89]  as well.

 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=279.9_D=12.9_C=0.82] I understand the sentiment behind the question. My understanding is that Victoria's levy comes in shortly [Bookmark: Phr23_O=294.0_D=11.0_C=0.84] ; it takes effect 1 January this year. We will be taking some learnings from that so we develop our policy in a very well thought through manner, as you would expect us to do. There is no doubt that there will be learnings from the Victorian experience, which I believe was the first to go down this pathway. We are still committed to the policy. The policy will be implemented, but we will look at how it is being implemented in Victoria to take some learnings from that.

If your question is about the continuation of the short-stay accommodation levy and our commitment in the 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania - does it still exist? The answer is yes, most certainly it does.

Mr Willie - Which party is introducing new taxes?

The SPEAKER - You do not have the call, Mr Willie. I will give the call to the member for Bass, Mrs Pentland.


Tasmanian AFL Team Licence

Mrs PENTLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.22 a.m.]
Tasmanian footy fans woke up this morning to worrying news about the future of the state's AFL licence. The Age is reporting the league has agreed club presidents will get a fresh vote if the timelines detailed in your deal change. Does this not again prove you signed us up to an agreement in which the AFL has all the power? The Gruen report confirmed it is an unbalanced deal, with Tasmanian taxpayers carrying all the risk. Given there is a very real chance the stadium timeline will blow out, what assurances can you offer Tasmanians this morning? Will you demand an urgent meeting with the AFL to discuss the potential of a fresh vote on our team's future?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I am sure the member can appreciate the opportunity before us with our own AFL team. I believe what some in this Chamber, particularly over there, do not like in particular is the fact that it took a Liberal government to secure the licence. For decades we have fought for our own AFL and AFLW teams. It was a challenge, but we got the job done.

When I hear of inspirational speeches that were made at the Hall of Fame last Friday night, from Brendon Gale, Trevor Leo, Ian Stewart and others, it really gels the reason why it is so important to have our own AFL and AFLW teams and bring that aspiration to young Tasmanian boys and girls. That is why I am committed to the team. That is why, along with a deal, it requires a stadium. It took strong negotiations, but also a deal that secured the 19th licence. 

I met with AFL representatives last week. It was a very cordial discussion as it always is. We will work through any challenges that are before us, and there will be challenges. I have no doubt about that. I ask this Chamber - I do not expect that side - to be constructive and to have the big picture in mind and never lose sight of it. If we can get this team up and running and the stadium built, it will be the most significant economic opportunity seen in Tasmania in decades. That is why I am committed to it. I will not resile from it. 

You have pointed to some challenges. I accept that. I only expect constructive discussion with the AFL, which we have had. Whatever barriers or hurdles are put in our way, I am sure we can work through and overcome them for the benefit of not me, but all the young people who are excited about the opportunity of playing for their own team.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. 

Supplementary Question

Mrs PENTLAND - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mrs PENTLAND - In the meetings last week, did you discuss the potential of the president getting a second vote, or will you call an urgent meeting to discuss that potential? 

The SPEAKER - That was the original question and arising from the answer, so it is in order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - No, the president's additional other vote did not come up in discussion.


Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation - Purpose

Mr JENNER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.27 a.m.]
You stated that the Hydro is the only GBE that you would rule out selling, presumably because of the significant dividends it supplies to the state, and yet in the same breath you acknowledge that while other GBEs also generate dividends, you believe privatisation of these are justified if it leads to better service delivery. Can I ask which it is? Will you admit that your plan to privatise the majority of GBEs is not about improving services to Tasmania, but simply a short-term fix to a long-term budget problem?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I will reiterate that the sacred cow, the Hydro, stays and will always stay under our government. They had a 24-hour policy to gut it. We, however, will not, because it is an economic generating enabler. It is important to not only the culture of Tasmania, but also for Tasmania's energy and economic security.
I will look at the wording of your question, but I have not promised to sell the majority of GBEs. What I have said is that we will have a sensible and measured discussion in looking at all our GBEs and how they best deliver for Tasmania. First and foremost, it will be service delivery. Should we make a decision, through this parliament of course, to sell two or three GBEs - if it comes to that, it might be more, might be less - into a future fund, we will do that for the benefit of Tasmanians again. The first question at the forefront of my mind on any potential asset sales is: is it good for Tasmania? If it is not good for Tasmania, then we will not proceed with an individual GBE. 

I invite you to be constructive in the conversation, accepting your view as it may well stand now. However, when Mr Eslake, the 'premium economist', as Dr Woodruff, I believe, spoke of - we know we value all premium economists. Mr Eslake is one of those. We outlined recommendations 3 and 11 in our state of the state speech as well: listening. Mr Eslake's work will be very insightful and needed when it comes to availing the information upon Tasmanians. 

Dr Woodruff - You have no idea what you want him to do because you have no idea what you want to do. You just want to cut.

The SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff, it was a question from Mr Jenner, so I will allow it to be answered. Premier, do not answer Dr Woodruff. Answer Mr Jenner, please.

Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation - Vehicle Registration Costs

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.31 a.m.] 
Average car registration in Tasmania costs $590. In Queensland it is $814. In New South Wales it is $1020. In the Australian Capital Territory, registering a vehicle costs nearly $1200, double what it does in Tasmania. All three of those states and territories have privatised their motor insurance companies. Why should Tasmanian families pay twice as much for their car registration just because you have blown our budget?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. Thank you for acknowledging how well we have done when it comes to keeping those cost-of-living prices down for Tasmanians. 

Members interjecting.

Mr Willie - You want to sell it. Flog it off in a fire sale.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left. Mr Willie, you are warned for a second time. This is it.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You have been coming in here the last two years, bumping your gums once again, talking about cost of living and all those types of things. Today, you get up and say what a great job the Liberal government has done on putting downward pressure on fees and charges, premiums and energy prices, and everything else. We have heard from the Labor opposition what a great job this Liberal government has done supporting Tasmanians through a cost-of-living crisis, which is fantastic, so well done. What you want to do - 

Ms Dow - Delusional, misunderstood, Premier.

The SPEAKER - Order, Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ROCKLIFF - What you want to do with your plan, in only thinking of profits, is one, your energy spokesperson over there signalled the end of renewable energy dividends -

Ms Finlay - Securing investment to grow the economy of Tasmania, which you cannot do.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Bass, you are warned. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - We had the signal over there from the energy spokesperson about ending the renewable energy dividends, which has really supported Tasmanians through some tough times; those credits to the power bills. Mr Winter, your profit-driving GBE so-called reform is all about increasing charges and levies or sacking people in those GBEs. I want you to go out there and say which one it is today, but you are too scared, as usual.

Ms Brown - I want you to tell those students that you are raising the bus fares.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Franklin, Ms Brown is also warned. Members on my right, I can hear you. There will be a general warning issued if I have to. 

Premier, I draw you to the question, which was quite specific. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - It was. Thank you for the acknowledgement, as I say it again, but another scare campaign. Tasmanians are wearing very thin of scare campaigns from the opposition. Labor is so captured by its economic incompetence when it was in government, when there was a recession, that you still want to talk about recessions. You are urging Tasmania to be in recession every single day, you lot, captured by your incompetence 10 or 11 years ago.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, Deputy Leader, member for Franklin. You will not be warned again.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Yesterday, we saw state final demand grew 3 per cent in the December quarter compared to a year ago - listen to this - topping all other states in growth over this period.
The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - The same question: does the Premier accept that Tasmanian families could pay up to twice as much for their car registration under a privatised MAIB (Motor Accidents and Insurance Board)?

The SPEAKER - I will call the Premier to the question, which is in order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - This is weak, frankly. No ticker. 

Members interjecting.

Ms Haddad - It has happened everywhere else that has privatised. The prices have gone up. Why would it be different here?

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Clark.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Should we proceed with a sale, member for Clark, there will be community service obligations built into that sale. We would not get it through this parliament if there was not. Perhaps that is somewhere you people can make a contribution, in protecting Tasmanian consumers to ensure that what we said we would do - and we will do it - actually comes to fruition when it comes to legislation. That is where we want some constructive dialogue, Dr Woodruff, when it comes to those matters, rather than a scare campaign. 

What the state of the state was all about is a significant reform agenda regarding the future, but also about continuing that strong momentum for the Tasmanian economy.

 [Bookmark: _Hlk193355844] Public Service - Recruitment Freeze - Fixed-Term Contracts

Ms JOHNSTON question to TREASURER, Mr BARNETT

[10.36 a.m.]
Many people in the public service are on fixed-term contracts, positions like Parks and Wildlife officers who are doing vegetation clearing to reduce bushfire threats; teacher assistants and school support workers; support staff for detectives; community service order supervisors; pharmaceutical support staff; and allied health workers who keep people out of hospital. Does your recruitment freeze apply to fixed-term contracts? If so, how many people on fixed-term contracts are at risk of becoming unemployed?


ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. Of course, that is an important question because it goes to the right size of the public service. In the last five years we have seen an 18 per cent increase in the size of the State Service in Tasmania, but a 5 per cent increase in the population of Tasmania. The Premier has made it clear in the state of the state address. He showed leadership - unlike the opposition leader, who has no ticker and has not demonstrated any leadership, apart from expressing views with respect to increased costs and charges or sacking people within those GBEs. That is the concern I have.

You referred to the hiring freeze. I have made it clear in terms of the process. It will be managed first by the secretaries of each portfolio and in consultation with the head of the State Service. 

With respect to the fixed-term contracts that you referenced, just to be very clear, existing fixed-term contracts will be honoured. Fixed-term positions will be reviewed in the same way as permanent roles. The hiring freeze does not specifically target fixed-term employees. However, heads of agencies will assess whether extensions or new fixed-term appointments will proceed. This is a normal process going through due process and that is consistent with the government's policy.


Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.38 a.m.]
In 1997, when Tasmania's last minority Liberal government ran out of money, they too embarked on a massive privatisation push. It is what you lot always do: run Tasmania into the ground and then flog off our assets. As part of their fire sale, TasRail was sold, and it was a complete disaster. The Premier talked earlier about guarantees from private companies that buy things. The new owners of TasRail gave those guarantees too. Then, after they stripped the assets in 2005 they came crawling back and demanded $100 million as an annual subsidy. They threatened to shut down Tasmania's rail network if they did not get it. It took a Labor government to fix the mess, stare them down, buy it back and rebuild the infrastructure.  Is this not exactly the same sort of policy and costly disaster that is going to be repeated across the state under your plan to sell off Tasmania's assets?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I remember our shadow minister for infrastructure. It must have been around 2009, Sturgo, I believe, was the minister for infrastructure - a great person and a really affable member of parliament. He was left a mess from the Labor government. Trains fell off tracks under a Labor government.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Yes, there you go. I felt for him at the time, because he is a good chap and he was let down by his own side. 

Labor's record on asset sales is there for all to see. In 2003, they sold the Stanley Cool Stores Board, the Civil Construction Corporation (CCC), and the Tasmanian Grain Elevators Board. Do you remember that, the CCC? I remember it. They floated selling the Hobart Ports Corporation and the Launceston Silverdome. Gosh, heavens above, here we go. Between 2006 and 2007, they sold off Henty House in Launceston, and the Hobart Airport for $300 million, and passed legislation to allow the sale of the Bell Bay Power Station. 

In 2008, they sold the Marine Board Building for $17.5 million. That year they also sold off the Printing Authority of Tasmania and the Southern Regional Cemetery Trust. 

In 2009, they announced the decision to sell the TOTE. Do you remember that?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Can we have some order in the House, please?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Previously they said it was not for sale. This is the time when we had the Labor government talking about hay and the barn, but they had the hay in the barn and then they sold all the hay and then burnt down the barn. This is the Labor Party and this is why they had to sell.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on both sides, thank you.

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.4_D=25.9_C=0.67] That has you up and about. There is a bit more energy in you now rather than watching your Leader of the Opposition's speech yesterday, I have to say. No, I am still going. I still have 35 seconds. I am really looking forward to those 30 seconds.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on both sides, the Premier has 27 seconds to come to the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - After previously saying it was not for sale, they eventually got $103 million,  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=56.9_D=1.2_C=0.74] $250 million less than the  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=59.3_D=25.4_C=0.75] purported sale price, and less than the Auditor-General said it was worth. Also in 2009, after ruling out the sale of Aurora in 2012, it was back on the table, bundled up with electricity reforms that provided for its sale. Both bills were supported in parliament. In 2011 Hydro sold off a state -

Ms BADGER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.43 a.m.]
You have repeatedly had the opportunity to rule out individual GBEs from your fire sale, and you will not. All of Tasmania's GBEs - except, of course, 'sacred cow' Hydro - are on the chopping block, including Forestry Tasmania and the Port Arthur Historic Site Management Authority. These are not only publicly owned GBEs. These are custodians of public land, this island's production forests and the World Heritage Port Arthur Historic site. We are not surprised that  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=127.8_D=29.9_C=0.79] you are privatising public land given your record in the Wilderness World Heritage Area, except that is not actually making you money. Tasmanians will not stand for this. This is more than selling off a government business. These are public places of deep local importance. 

How did you manage to become so disconnected from everyday Tasmanians and will you today rule out a public land fire sale? 

Mr Abetz - Acknowledging production forests as being of vital importance.

The SPEAKER - Minister Abetz, interjecting during a question is not acceptable.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=160.3_D=0.6_C=0.33] Mr Abetz - What? I did not. I was talking to the Premier.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=162.6_D=26.0_C=0.58] The SPEAKER - Do not look confused, minister Abetz. You know.

Dr Broad - That is his resting face.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Dr Broad. The Premier has the call and the time starts now. 

ANSWER

I have not seen minister Abetz's face, but he is probably perplexed at the Greens saying how important production forests are in Tasmania. 

Dr Woodruff - They are publicly owned forests; we want to end native forest logging.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You have moderated over the summer. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=191.5_D=0.7_C=0.85] 

Mr Abetz - They need to be protected.

Mr ROCKLIFF - There you go.

Dr Woodruff - That is right. Thank you very much.

Ms Badger - Thank you.

Mr Bayley - That is right. New national parks and reserves.

The SPEAKER - Order, Leader of the Greens, Deputy Leader of the Greens, Ms Badger, and minister Abetz.

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=196.3_D=24.5_C=0.73] Production forests: the new Greens policy. How fantastic is that? That is great. Alright, thank you. That is interesting.

I believe I have expressed my view on this very clearly. While ruling out Hydro for the obvious reasons as we have expressed [Bookmark: Phr14_O=222.2_D=4.7_C=0.74] , why would we not look at all our GBEs [Bookmark: Phr15_O=227.3_D=23.9_C=0.75]  in a sensible way? As I have said, we will not be selling all our GBEs. Some, or most, might be better in public hands, but some might be better and deliver services to Tasmania better, and the sale proceeds put into a future fund to benefit Tasmania and Tasmanians.  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=252.4_D=11.4_C=0.82] Why would you not look at that?

It may have been the same thinking as the Labor Party back in their day when  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=265.6_D=1.6_C=0.92] everything was on the table.  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=267.8_D=28.5_C=0.78] They pretty much ripped through everything. Here we go: in 2011, Hydro sold off a major stake in the Woolnorth Wind Farms to a Chinese investment company for $88.6 million. In 2011, Labor sold a 50 per cent stake in Softwood Plantations to new forests for $156 million, with the state maintaining ownership of the land, of course. Riddled with the weak leadership of the Leader of the Opposition is utter hypocrisy.

The SPEAKER - I actually think Ms Badger has a supplementary that I would like to hear before anybody else jumps.

Supplementary Question

Ms BADGER - The original question was ruling out the fire sale of public land, GBE or otherwise. The Premier has not touched on the public land aspect of the question.

The SPEAKER - It was a specific question, Premier, and I will draw you to it. You did spend some time talking about everybody else's sales.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I will correct the record when I said that, in 2011, Labor sold a 50 per cent stake in Softwood Plantations to New Forests for $156 million - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Can I ask members to all be quiet? Can I stop the clock for a moment? Premier, as you take the time to correct the record - which you absolutely should - it should not take up the time of a supplementary question. I might ask you to answer Ms Badger, and then I will give you leave to add to your answer to correct the record.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It will only take a couple of seconds. It was not the Labor Party that sold off, it was the Labor-Greens government that sold off a 50 per cent stake in softwood, so I want to make that correction.

The SPEAKER - Premier, you are testing my patience today. The fact that I am here on my birthday is annoying enough. Do not test my patience. Answer the question from Ms Badger now.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my right will be silent.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I mentioned GBEs specifically for a reason and GBEs it is.

Salmon Industry - Mass Mortality Crisis

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.48 a.m.]
Your government's bungled management of the salmon mass-mortality crisis shows just how badly you have been captured by this foreign-owned industry. We now know salmon are dying from Piscirickettsia salmonis bacteria, the same illness that wiped out 90 per cent of the Chilean industry. This is a biosecurity emergency. You have allowed Tasmanians to continue swimming and fishing in waters filled with the decaying remains of heavily diseased salmon, while the gutless Environment Protection Authority (EPA) told people the rotting fish on beaches are good for you, just like fish oil tablets.

Your government has covered up and downplayed this outrageous biosecurity disaster, spreading disinformation and potentially caused harm not only to native fish, but to humans. You allowed the salmon industry to run roughshod over regulations and biosecurity restrictions and this is the result. Will you take accountability for this mammoth stuff-up? What urgent action will you take to address this biosecurity crisis?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Before the clock starts, if members have an issue with the content of a question in terms of its truthfulness, they have substantive ways of dealing with that and interjecting is not okay.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. I point to my comments on Tuesday where I said that I expect accountability and transparency from salmon companies and that the salmon companies are on notice, and they are. In saying that, I also expect the highest possible degree of accountability and transparency and openness from the salmon companies because it is in Tasmania's brand interests and Tasmanian salmon industry interests as well.

I acknowledge the community concerns with this matter, which is why I expressed the sentiment that I did on Tuesday. We also acknowledge that this is really challenging for the many hundreds of employees in the salmon industry. They are working diligently on what is a difficult and unfortunate circumstance and I feel for them as well.

The current salmon mortality event is largely due to an endemic bacterium that does not grow in humans and does not present a human or animal health or food safety risk. From an environmental perspective, the critical issue is the timely collection and management of fish residue in an improved manner.

These incidents are typically elevated during the summer months when warmer waters and other factors affecting salmon health are more likely to occur. Reports over recent months suggest widespread availability of nutrients along the east and south-east coast of Tasmania, brought in by an east Australian current. I am advised some algae, jellyfish, and other marine organisms are known irritants to salmon gills and may lead to increased mortalities. The marine heatwave conditions have occurred in waters immediately east of Tasmania over the past two summers and contribute to an inter annual variability of Storm Bay in particular.

The Environment Protection Authority remains the agency responsible for managing the fish mortality event and associated deposit of fatty substances in the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. Public Health is providing advice to the EPA. I am advised that testing undertaken by the EPA has demonstrated that fatty substances are derived from fish and/or fish oil, and the bacterial infection causing the mortality does not cause human disease. Public health alerts are issued when circumstances pose a significant risk of harm to health, particularly when the public may not recognise or understand the risk.

In the current circumstances, the well-publicised presence of fish material on beaches -

The SPEAKER - The time for answering the question has expired. I will speak to the students for a moment. See how quiet it is when someone answers a question? Lovely, is it not? I will take the supplementary question from the Leader of the Greens.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - Speaker, I would like the Premier to be clear about his comment that Piscirickettsia salmonis is endemic in Tasmania. My understanding is that that is not true. It is a very important point. This is a biosecurity crisis. A new bacteria, confirmed yesterday as Piscirickettsia salmonis by the minister, Mr Abetz, is now in Tasmania. I understand the scientists say it has never been here before. Can you confirm that that is in fact true, and it is the same one that caused the Chilean outbreak?

The SPEAKER - It does arise from the answer that the Premier gave, so I will allow the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I have just outlined what I am advised. I can seek further clarification for you on that matter and provide that answer at a later time today.

The SPEAKER - I will just confirm that that matter is being taken on notice?

Mr ROCKLIFF -Yes.


 [Bookmark: _Hlk193355973] TT-Line and Spirit of Tasmania Vessels - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.54 a.m.]
The Spirits of Tasmania fiasco is the biggest infrastructure stuff-up in Tasmania's history, and, along with debt, deficit, and privatisation, it will be your legacy to this place. In response to all of this on Tuesday, you said and I quote, 'The challenge we faced with the Spirits raises an important question about what businesses the government should own'.

Effectively, your argument is that because you stuffed up building the berth, your government should start selling off Tasmania's assets. It is completely absurd. TT-Line has been the flagship for Tasmania's tourism industry. It has helped primary producers get their products to mainland markets for decades. Are you considering selling our Spirits as part of your privatisation agenda?

ANSWER

Speaker, TT-Line and the Spirits have been a fantastic asset for the Tasmanian people and economy over many years - an economy where State Final Demand grew 3 per cent over the past year, topping all other states in growth over this period; nation-leading economic growth.

Maybe the glum faces over there were not just the Leader of the Opposition's pathetic state of the state reply. Maybe the glum faces were the fact that we were not going into recession and that State Final Demand is now $48.9 billion - a record over the past 12 months for Tasmania. I say, thank you -

Mr Winter - Are you going to sell TT-Line or not?

The SPEAKER - If members wish to raise Standing Order 45 they may. Otherwise they will be silent.

Mr ROCKLIFF - to, as the Leader of Opposition alluded to in his question, the tourism industry. Thank you to the businesses around Tasmania, their employees around Tasmania, the hardworking Tasmanians, for contributing to such a robust economy in difficult and challenging times globally. That is something that we can be very proud of.

Now, I know you do not like the fact that the economy is growing, because you are captured by your incompetence when you were in government -

Ms Brown - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. He is going nowhere near the question. This is about the Spirits and if they are on the chopping block under his leadership.

The SPEAKER - Thank you. I will draw the Premier to the question. I remind members that when they jump up to raise a point of order, they do have to wait until I recognise them.

Ms Brown - Sorry.

The SPEAKER - Thank you. That is a matter for a number of members. Premier, I recognise you and draw you to the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, Speaker. The point that I was clearly making, given the economic focus of the Opposition Leader's question, was that so captured are they by their economic incompetence when they were in government with the Greens, where the state went into recession, that every single day they urge a recession for Tasmania, which means fewer jobs for Tasmanians and less opportunity for families to put food on the table. 

The SPEAKER - Premier, you have 30 seconds and I have asked you to come to the question. Previous Speakers have sat ministers down if they are not answering questions. I will start employing that. Speaker Polley did, if anyone wishes to check the reference.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, Speaker. Look, I could just point to my previous answers on this subject. Hydro here - and why would we not sensibly look at every other GBE? 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - All right, members, is there a supplementary question you are seeking?

Mr WINTER - There certainly is, Speaker, arising from that answer. 

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - Is the Premier really saying that in the midst of a crisis around TT-Line and its inability to build a berth, that he is now putting it well and truly on the chopping block for sale?

The SPEAKER - It does arise from the original question and the answer given by the Premier. It is a matter of significant importance. I am not sure who was interjecting there, but I would like to hear the answer. I am sure the Tasmanian people would as well. We have one minute for the Premier's answer. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Speaker, thank you. More monologue of misery from those opposite. A monologue of misery is all we hear from those opposite. I have said Hydro, and why would we not sensibly look at others? Okay. 

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Okay, oh, gee whiz. You are so immature. Some GBEs are clearly more likely than others to go through a sale process should it go through this parliament, so I am not going to play any silly rule-in or rule-out games. You are just being silly. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left. Leader of the Greens.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Stop defending him. 

The SPEAKER - Premier, you will address your answers through the Chair. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - I know he needs your help, but you do not have to -

I will take the next question. The answers will be addressed through the Chair. These interjections and conversations across the Chamber will stop. I will take the Deputy Leader of the Greens.


Salmon Industry - Funding of the Environment Protection Authority

Mr BAYLEY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.59 a.m.]
Evidence of the failure of your half-baked EPA reforms and acquiescence to industry have washed up in chunks on iconic Tasmanian beaches. Distressing footage was released this morning of live salmon being scraped into bins for disposal. This is not only a biosecurity disaster, this is an animal cruelty crisis. Anger over salmon farming has grown for years. It has now reached new levels. You cannot ignore this any longer. You have sat on your hands. Meanwhile, the EPA is without a director and has failed its responsibility to update the community and to protect the environment. Worse, it has been dodging and weaving and spreading industry disinformation to community. Will you commit to beefing up the EPA's funding and powers in the wake of this catastrophe? Will you confirm all EPA roles are quarantined from your hiring freeze and update the House on the appointment of a new director?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I agree with you on the seriousness of the matter. I expressed that very clearly on Tuesday when I was asked a question, I believe, from Dr Woodruff on this particular matter, where I said the companies are on notice, where I said it was concerning.

When you speak of the EPA, I point you to the significant reforms that we made over the course of the last 10 years when it comes to accountability and transparency and independent oversight of the salmon industry. The Labor-Greens government did not do this when it had the chance. We did this in 2015 and 2016, if my memory serves me correctly. It ensured the monitoring and the regulating of the salmon industry, which was then contained in the Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment, which was also in charge of the growth of the industry. We took that out and created independent oversight, okay? We also increased - or in fact - implemented penalties for non-compliance when it comes to marine debris matters, for example. I do not accept the premise of your question that says that we have done nothing.

What I have always been very keen on - and the Salmon Plan points to that, as does the Legislative Council inquiry, from which there are a number of recommendations being worked through within the Salmon Plan - to ensure greater level of accountability: all that work that was done in the Legislative Council, all the work that was done from primary industries ministers, Palmer, Barnett, Howlett and others on the Salmon Plan, which is really about strengthening that oversight and accountability of the salmon industry.

We are going through the budget process now. We have made very clear our intention regarding our direction over the course of the last seven days, as we have outlined. We expect the highest degree of accountability for the salmon company.

The SPEAKER - The time for answering the question has expired. I am assuming I am hearing a supplementary from the Deputy Leader of the Greens.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - Absolutely, Speaker. The EPA is still working under government policies. The second part of the question was around confirming whether EPA roles are quarantined from the hiring freeze and to update the House on the appointment of a new director. 

The SPEAKER - Thank you. Those matters were included in the original question. I will draw the Premier to that.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Speaker, we are still working through the appointment of the EPA director and will inform the community when those processes have worked through. I pay tribute to Wes Ford, who has been an outstanding EPA director and is keeping everyone accountable to ensure safety, environment and the matters that Tasmanians care about. Tasmanians care a lot about the salmon industry. They care a lot about it in terms of the economy, and the jobs it creates in rural regional Tasmania. They really care about it -

Mr Bayley - The hiring freeze? Does that apply to the EPA?

Mr ROCKLIFF - but that, as I said the other day, is not a blank cheque to the salmon companies. It is not a blank cheque.

Dr Woodruff - Answer the question. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - There are - absolutely, it is essential.

Dr Woodruff - Are you going to have a recruitment freeze?

Mr Bayley - Is the EPA subject to the hiring freeze?

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens, I said I would warn you next time. You are warned. Deputy Leader, you can cease interjecting as well. The time for answering the question has expired. I will take Ms Finlay, the member for Bass. It was very close though, Mr Garland.


Marinus Link and North West Transmission Site

Ms FINLAY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.05 a.m.]
The North West Transmission is key to Marinus. It is key to the state's two largest proposed wind farms and key to the HIF eFuels plant. If you privatise and sell off TasNetworks, who is going to build it?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, the Labor Party, since their disastrous leader's speech yesterday, has been working really hard at trying to think of every single silly angle.

Dr Broad - You are not thinking things through.
Ms Finlay - Do you think North West Transmission is silly?

The SPEAKER - Order. Dr Broad, Ms Finlay, if you wish to remain in question time, you are about to get a second warning.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You talk about the North West Transmission line and you talk about Marinus. I think 12 months ago you could not even make a decision whether or not you supported Marinus and the North West Transmission Developments.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. Members on both sides, you can stop being helpful.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It is just like your stadium stuff. He could not make a call on that either. It took you two years to work out what you thought about all that.

Ms Finlay - Answer the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Sorry, my apologies, Ms Finlay. We knew exactly where you stood on the stadium. You did not like it -

Ms Finlay - Yes, forgot where you were. Will you just answer the question? Who is going to build North West Transmission?

The SPEAKER - Order, Ms Finlay.

Mr ROCKLIFF - all those stickers, we well remember. It is fantastic that we have so much investment opportunity when it comes to our renewable electricity generation in Tasmania - 

Ms Finlay - You are losing it all.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It is fantastic to see HIF Global and others are absolutely committed to investing in Tasmania.

Ms Finlay - How are they going to hook into the lines?

The SPEAKER - Order, Ms Finlay, you have a second warning. If you wish to stay, take the lesson from Mr Willie, who has remained very silent since his second warning.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The North West Transmission Developments are of strategic importance to Tasmania's energy future as a contingent project to Marinus Link, as I was identifying previously. Any scare campaign that you might want to put forward, Ms Finlay, I just reject out of hand. Tasmanians are awake to the Labor Party. No substance, no ideas, no plan, urging Tasmanians into recession every single day.

It is not this government that proves the Labor opposition wrong when it comes to recession - it is Tasmanians. It is Tasmanians who work so hard and who keep this economy going and that is exactly why we are in their corner.

Supplementary Question

Ms FINLAY - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms FINLAY - Clearly, from that answer, the Premier has no idea who is going to build it when he privatises TasNetworks -

Mr Ellis - You could do a fire sale of your bumper stickers.

The SPEAKER - Order, Mr Ellis, you are now warned, especially for your guest.

Ms FINLAY - My question to the Premier is: have you actually thought this through?

Ms Butler - This is 50 ways of how not to answer a question.

The SPEAKER - Order. The member for Lyons, Ms Butler, is also warned.

Mr ROCKLIFF - From my point of view, sensible people are welcoming the conversation. I understand that major renewables developers have welcomed the conversation about TasNetworks, for example. If you look at the business community, they have welcomed the conversation.

I read the editorial in the Mercury today, which does not always engender enthusiasm from myself at 5.30 in the morning, but today the last line there did -

A member - Cut that out, put it on the wall, frame it.

The SPEAKER - I remind members not to reflect on anyone in the House.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The last line there said, 'but a sensible, measured conversation is what we all need', and that is all I ask from this parliament.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for addressing the question has expired.


Salmon Industry - Salvage of Diseased Salmon

Mr GARLAND question to MINISTER for PRIMARY RESOURCES and WATER, Ms HOWLETT

[11.10 a.m.]
Happy birthday, honourable Speaker.

Last week, Salmon Tasmania CEO, Luke Martin, told ABC Radio National that we are dealing with an outbreak of a particular bacteria that is perfectly safe for human consumption, and that it has no impact on other wild fish, being just a salmon disease created by these bacteria. Are diseased salmon being salvaged from pens and sold by the salmon companies for human consumption?
ANSWER

Happy birthday, honourable Speaker. 

I thank the member for his question. I am advised by the Chief Veterinary Officer that he received the full laboratory results of samples at midday on Friday. The test results confirm that the species is Piscirickettsia salmonis. The Chief Veterinary Officer said the test results confirmed that these are fish bacteria that do not grow in humans and that they are not human or animal health or food safety at risk. The matter remains under investigation, led by the EPA. I will have to find out if that has been present before or if it is new.

The SPEAKER - Minister, have you taken something on notice?

Ms HOWLETT - Yes, I have taken that on notice.

The SPEAKER - Which is around whether this is a new disease? 

Ms HOWLETT - Correct.

The SPEAKER - Which the Premier, I believe, has already taken on notice, so that is fine. We have that one. 

Supplementary Question

Mr GARLAND - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr GARLAND - My question was: are they being used for human consumption?

The SPEAKER - I will call the minister to that question, as it was the original question from the member for Braddon.

Ms HOWLETT - I will take that on notice.

The SPEAKER - You will take that on notice, and you will come back to the House today?

Ms HOWLETT - Yes, the human consumption as well. I will take that on notice and have a response by the end of today.


TT-Line - Plans and Designs for New Devonport Infrastructure

Mrs BESWICK question to MINISTER for TRANSPORT, Mr ABETZ

[11.12 a.m.]
Happy birthday, honourable Speaker.

North-west coast residents are watching the long overdue progress of the Devonport port with intense interest. While they are pleased to see some activity, they are disappointed over the lack of publicly available plans for the project. When will plans and designs of the terminal car park and biosecurity infrastructure be released?

ANSWER

First of all, Happy Birthday, honourable Speaker. 

In answer to the member for Braddon, I am not sure as to the release of the designs. That would have to be carefully monitored in relation to contracts being let and commercial considerations. That said, I am more than happy to take advice from TT-Line, which is charged with the building of berth 3, and see what information can be made available to the member and to this place.

The SPEAKER - Thank you. We will take on notice what is possible to be provided to the House at this point, which may lead to further questions.


 [Bookmark: _Hlk193356276] North West Transmission Developments - Proposal for Privatisation

Ms FINLAY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.14 a.m.]
You have stated your intention to privatise TasNetworks, the company charged with building the North West Transmission Developments project. However, as of today, there is still no route design, no agreement from Sustainable Timbers Tasmania (STT) and no agreements with landholders. It seems that you are at risk of causing another Spirits fiasco, where we are going to end up with two major wind farms and a second cable to the mainland, and no way to plug them in. Tens of billions of dollars of investment and thousands of jobs depend on getting this transmission built. How will privatising TasNetworks help with this stalled project and get it back on track?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. I am pleased that she is on board with Marinus. It took you a while. It took the Labor - 

Ms Finlay - It was never in doubt, Premier. If you guys got out of the way, maybe we could have Marinus.

Member Suspended

Member for Bass - Ms Finlay

The SPEAKER - Premier, I will stop the clock. This is a very difficult thing now. I am afraid, Ms Finlay, that is your third go and you will have to leave the Chamber. You will be able to hear the answer from outside. I do not like to do this because it is the last question of the day. You can return at the end of the MPI.

Ms Finlay withdrew.
———————————————————
Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, honourable Speaker. Do I need to wait till Ms Finlay reaches a television to hear the answer?

The SPEAKER - I take interjections if they are witty. That was close, but just get to the question now, thank you.

Mr ROCKLIFF - As I have said before, I understand that major renewables developers have welcomed the conversation about TasNetworks. Nothing is set in stone, but why would you not you look at, in a sensible way, the opportunity of delivering better services for Tasmanians?

The SPEAKER - That is the end of Question Time. Thank you all very much for your excellent behaviour today. Oh, hang on; I will change that because Hansard does not actually record sarcasm.

CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Pets in Rentals

Mr BAYLEY question to MINISTER for HOUSING, Mr ELLIS

My constituent Charlene from Hobart asks: I have been renting for 13 years and for the last six I have had guinea pigs. They are incredibly important to me and my mental health. They do not even come into contact with the properties I live in. They are very clean animals, and yet landlords do not permit them. In my last two rentals, I have simply had to lie on the application and say that I do not have pets. When it comes time for inspections, I have to hide them, which is incredibly frustrating and upsetting.

Your government promised to make changes to give renters the right to allow pets in their homes. Almost a year has gone by and the change still has not been made. When will you progress your bill to ensure Tasmanian renters do not have to give up their beloved pets just for a safe and affordable home?


Healthcare Availability in Tasmania

Ms BUTLER question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

A constituent of mine from Boomer Bay, who has also written to you, has been required to travel interstate for her seven-year-old son to access the healthcare he needs. He was diagnosed with ADHD in June last year but cannot get an appointment with a paediatrician, public or private, to prescribe the medication he needs. She says, 'My son's schooling is suffering, his home life is suffering, and as a family we are left without options'. Even worse, though, they now have an appointment in Melbourne at the end of April. They will face the challenge of filling a prescription in Tasmania that has been issued interstate.

Why should Tasmanian children have to travel to Melbourne to get the help they need? What support will your government provide this family who have had to pay massive travel costs? When will the legislation you promised last year to resolve the interstate prescriptions issue actually be introduced?


 [Bookmark: _Hlk193356548] Environmental Commitment as Leader - Fracking Practices

Mr WILLIE question to MINISTER for BUSINESS, INDUSTRY and RESOURCES, Mr ABETZ

My question is on behalf of my constituent Sean Thurstons of Moonah. The government has acknowledged that a 2015 review into fracking in Tasmania highlighted significant concerns, including risk to our agricultural industries, branding and markets, public and environmental health, community cohesion, and landowner engagement. The minister has stated his commitment to maintaining Tasmania's long-term prosperity and reputation as a leader in clean, sustainable practices.

Why has the government not given the agricultural and tourism industry certainty by legislating a ban of fracking practices, rather than a moratorium? In the unlikely event the gas industry can prove it is a safe and sustainable practice, could the legislation not just be amended or repealed?


Royal Hobart Hospital - Relocation of Mother-Baby Unit

Mr BEHRAKIS question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

Several constituents in Hobart have contacted me concerned over the closure of maternity services at Healthscope. I have informed them of the announcement last week, which was received positively, but can the minister please provide details on the plan to relocate the mother-baby unit at the Royal Hobart Hospital to St Johns Park, and how this will help families?


Launceston UTAS Stadium - Building Works

Mr WOOD question to MINISTER for SPORT and EVENTS, Mr DUIGAN

I understand there has been a significant commitment to improvements at UTAS Stadium in Launceston. I have constituents in Bass who have noticed that some of these works are already underway. They want to know what the impact will be on games being played at the venue this year, and how the works will improve the experience at UTAS stadium.

First Reading

[11.22 a.m.]
Mr ELLIS (Braddon - Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Management) - Honourable Speaker, I present the Police Offences Amendment (Knives and Other Weapons) Bill 2025, known as Reid's Law. 

With your indulgence, I recognise in the gallery with us today Reid's mother, Laraine, and Reid's daughter, Matilda. Thank you for being here. Thank you for your courage on this journey. All Tasmanians owe you a debt of gratitude for your extraordinary courage. 

I also recognise the Beasley family who are watching on from Queensland, and  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=73.5_D=11.1_C=0.66] the tragic loss of their son, Jack, in similar circumstances. The work that we do here can never replace your loss, but we are so grateful for everything that you are doing for our state.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=86.8_D=20.3_C=0.50] Members - Hear, hear.

The SPEAKER - Minister, that is normally not permitted at that point for tabling, but in the circumstances, I think all members of the House would add their voices to yours for support of the families.

Spirits of Tasmania IV and V - Future

[11.24 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=163.6_D=1.6_C=0.69]  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=175.5_D=25.4_C=0.75] Mrs PENTLAND (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the House take note of the following matter: the future of Spirits of Tasmania IV and V. 

I welcome the opportunity to reflect on the ongoing Spirit of Tasmania saga and the government's decision not to further pursue leasing opportunities in Europe. It goes without saying it has been an embarrassing situation for the state and has come at a significant economic cost for the tourism sector, and significant political cost for the government.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=201.7_D=6.3_C=0.74] The opposition leader deserves credit for bringing the issue out into the light, but there comes a time when politics [Bookmark: Phr14_O=208.3_D=24.2_C=0.80]  must be replaced by pragmatism. That is why I have encouraged the government to pursue a leasing opportunity, despite the idea being panned by the opposition and some in our community. I understand the prospect of leaving Spirit IV was not broadly supported, but I believe we had an obligation to try to recoup some of the money wasted throughout this saga. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=233.5_D=7.2_C=0.80]  We have made a huge investment in those new ships and we need to start getting a return on that investment as soon as possible.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=241.8_D=25.5_C=0.84] Bear with me with this analogy, but if someone purchased a new home and was not able to move into it, let us say for two years, it is unlikely that they would be happy to leave it empty. You would explore all possible options to help pay down the mortgage, even if it meant another family living in your house before you. You try to make the best of a bad situation. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=268.1_D=3.0_C=0.88]  We need to treat the public's money like it is our own [Bookmark: Phr18_O=271.8_D=22.3_C=0.81] .

I was disappointed when the government announced that negotiations had ceased and the leasing agreements were off the table. I fear the political backlash got in the way of properly exploring an outcome that was financially beneficial to Tasmania, not to mention it could have had a positive humanitarian outcome. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=295.1_D=9.8_C=0.84]  Labor pointed out Red Cross's concern about housing refugees on a cruise ship or ferry. Of course, it is not the most appropriate accommodation. No one is saying it is, but in a time of crisis you do the best you can. We could have played a constructive role in a dire situation.

I also did not agree with the way Tasmania's homelessness crisis was highlighted as a reason not to help people overseas. It is completely unfair. There are two completely different issues. It is not like anyone would seriously suggest using the Spirits to house vulnerable Tasmanians. It would be completely rejected for a long list of reasons. We can do better than playing vulnerable Tasmanians off against people fleeing war.

I understand the legitimate concerns about the Spirits being in mint condition by the time the berth at Devonport is finally ready. Any leasing agreement would have to come with guarantees but, as soon as they are used for whatever reason, they are no longer brand new. I do not believe it should stand in the way of trying to recoup some of the money lost. Given the government and opposition are now on the same page about bringing the vessel back to Tasmania, I hope we get a clear plan from both parties as to exactly what should be done with the ships until the berth is completed. Hopefully, ideas that deliver an economic outcome to the state, whether that be directly into the budget or through a tourism venture that helps stimulate spending in our regional areas, are prioritised. I was very interested in the Transport minister's response to a question from the member of Braddon about Spirit V. I was pleased to hear the minister confirm that commercial options would be explored when the vessel completes sea trials.

If we can produce an early return on investment, we should seriously consider whether it is in the best interest of our state. Return on investment is at the heart of the debate around selling government-owned businesses. The government has gone from wanting to reform GBEs, including the proposed merger of TT-Line, TasPorts, and TasRail, to asset sales. While I remain open-minded and will allow the government to make the case, it is clear the Tasmanian public is instinctively opposed to privatisation. They say do not read the comments, but sometimes there are too many to ignore. Voters appear sceptical of the Premier's justification for exploring potential sales. The government will have to prove that the short-term financial gain will outweigh long-term dividends. It will have to prove that service delivery will not be diminished and it will have to prove that any sale will not lead to the detrimental outcome for local workers. Any privatisation will have to be in the best interest of future governments, not just this one. I am not ideologically opposed to privatisation, but it has to stack up.

[11.29 p.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, it is a shame that Mr Abetz is not that keen to stand up and make a contribution. It seems odd.

Mr Abetz - I want to hear what you have to say.

Ms DOW - Yes, right.

The SPEAKER - Conversations across the room will not be permitted.

Ms DOW - Much has been said in this place about truth and accountability today during Question Time. Much has also been said about industries and Tasmanian assets that Tasmanians care deeply about, and the Spirit of Tasmania vessels are exactly that. Tasmanians are proud of their Spirits. The Labor Party is proud of the Spirits. Quite rightly, Tasmanians deserve answers about the future of the Spirits.

It is great to see the independent member for Bass actually talking about the Spirits because it is, to my mind, one of the biggest issues. It is also the biggest infrastructure stuff-up in Tasmania's history and you should have an interest in it. What I find incredibly alarming, however, is that, this morning in Question Time, the Premier would not rule out privatising the Spirit of Tasmania vessels. Quite timely, you have raised this morning the future of Spirit IV and Spirit V. The Premier is obviously uncertain about their future as well and he will not rule out privatising the TT-Line and Tasmanians losing ownership of something of which they are incredibly proud. You talk a lot about the politics of the issue and, thanks to Labor and the work we did last year to bring forward information about this very important and critical issue for Tasmania because if we had been relying on those opposite, we would have been waiting for a very long time. I suspect that there is still a lot to learn about what has transpired. You only have to look at the events of the weekend, with the to-ing and fro-ing between the Tasmanian and Scottish governments. It evolved into very embarrassing situation, with the Scottish Government coming out and ruling out a leasing agreement with the Tasmanian government.

I will not begrudge any humanitarian effort for the people of Ukraine. What they have been through is an incredibly difficult and traumatic time and that is never what our questions and concerns about the leasing arrangement have been about. In fact, for many Tasmanians that would have come as quite a surprise as an option to the type of leasing arrangement the government was looking at because they certainly never indicated to the people of Tasmania that that was their intention. That then begs the question, where we have seen more waste of public funds by storing the vessel in Scotland to save face for this government and the international embarrassment that they are and continue to be due to this bungled project, this monumental stuff-up, were there really any live negotiations with the Scottish Government, or is it all part of a big farce?

I call on the minister, Mr Abetz, to come here and rule out privatising the TT-Line. The Premier said everything is on the table - it is going to have to be a pretty big table. Rule it out, explain to the Tasmanian people that you are not going to do that to the Spirit of Tasmania. They care deeply about the Spirit of Tasmania. In fact, it was their will to bring the Spirit home. They overwhelmingly want the Spirit brought home. They desperately want to know what is going on at berth 3: not just about the designs and the terminal, but about progress being made. The government has gone very quiet about developments at berth 3. I have called on the Premier to pop on his high-vis again, go out to the site and update the Tasmanian people about what exactly is going on there because people are saying to me that there is not a lot of activity on that site and they want answers from the government. They want to know what is going on.

The task for you today, then, Mr Abetz, is to rule out privatising the TT-Line, to give us more information about what negotiations went on with the Scottish Government, if any, and to give us an update on berth 3. Tasmanians will not want the TT-Line privatised. You need to rule it out, once and for all, and say it on the record. I thank the member for bringing forward this matter of public importance today. It is great to hear the two independent members speaking out, challenging the government. That is their job and it is good for them to do that. Rule it out, Mr Abetz.

[11.35 a.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for bringing this matter of public importance to this parliament. The future of the ferries should be that they are here, back in Tasmania, as soon as possible and remaining in public hands. This is the future that we need for the ferries. We want them to be working from a functioning Devonport berth and we want that gantry in place. We want them to be plying Bass Strait. First, before the Devonport berth is finalised, I would like to see the ferries berthed across the road at PW1 as a constant reminder to this parliament of the monumental waste and the colossal stuff-up that we have had in relation to this ferries fiasco.

We have been a laughing-stock because these vessels are being berthed in Leith in Scotland.  We have seen that this state has been in the international media for all the wrong reasons. It would be good to put this behind us; however, we cannot let this go. This has been a monumental waste of taxpayers' money.

I remind the House of the timeline. The original ferry cost in 2017 was $714 million, delivery by 2021. The German shipbuilder unfortunately went bust. Then the Finnish company, Rauma Marine Constructions (RMC) was then contracted. The 2020 contracts were cancelled due to COVID-19. Then there was the going down the rabbit hole looking for an Australian manufacturer. The cost is now $850 million and the delivery should have been, at that stage, 2023-24. We know that during caretaker government, there was a bailout of $83 million to RMC from TT-Line. The budget has been blown by half a billion dollars and we still do not have the wharf upgrades.

We are talking about the future. The future of the ferries must be in public hands. It is important that they continue to be in public hands. We need the government, and I also want to hear from the minister about ruling out the sale of this Tasmanian asset. We know that the north-west tourism operators in particular have been really disadvantaged by this delay of so many years and it has cost the taxpayers again more money - about a quarter of a million dollars package was provided and announced in December of last year to help offset the estimated half a billion dollars in revenue foregone for those tourism operators.

It is so important that the government does provide a future for the ferries working the Bass Strait and also in public hands. The Greens will be fighting to maintain this, but first we have to get the ferries home. The ferries, firstly, should be in Hobart as a constant reminder for the government until such time is ready.

Mrs Pentland - Wasting more money. Wasting more taxpayers' money.

The SPEAKER - Mrs Pentland, you do not often interject, so I will not make too much of it now, but I will give the Leader of the House the call.

[10.40 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Minister for Transport) - Honourable Speaker, what a juxtaposition it is to hear Mrs Pentland compared to the other two speakers we have heard. One looking forward, recognising the problem and then seeing the commercial advantages that might be able to be achieved, compared to the relentless negativity and the nasty aspersions, made especially by the Labor Party.

Mr Winter - Are you leasing them again?

Mr ABETZ - Let me put it on record that while Spirit IV was still in Finland, there was interest in having her leased, and people went to inspect. She then went to Leith and that was a place where, on good sound advice given that the most likely place for charter or lease was in the Northern Hemisphere, it made sense to keep her in that marketplace. 

As a result, and Mr Winter can laugh and Ms Dow can laugh, but early inquiries were made from 14 separate parties: 12 expressed interest in utilising the vessel for ferry operations and two expressed interest in utilising the vessel for accommodation solutions. On 13 January, two representatives from a party interested in utilising the vessel for an accommodation solution inspected the vessel in Scotland. On 20 January, two representatives from an agency that may provide support for an accommodation solution also inspected the vessel in Scotland. On 22 January, that is two days later, through the broker, an offer for a long-term charter was received. Here we have the Labor Party for weeks on end, asserting that somehow the government and TT-Line had been lying to the people of Tasmania. False. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left.

Mr ABETZ - Commercial negotiations were taking place and as a result - 

Ms Dow - Nothing much happens.

The SPEAKER - Order, Deputy Leader, you have had your contribution.

Mr ABETZ - as a responsible government, as a responsible minister, you do not say what is going on in the event that you prejudice the commercial negotiations and the possibility of a return to the Tasmanian people of literally millions of dollars.

Deliberately undermining that process, wishing that process not to succeed for cheap political purposes is something that ought to be condemned, and condemned widely. To try to wish that the Spirit would not be leased, just for a cheap political comment, is deplorable. It is putting your political interests in front of the Tasmanian interest. How deplorable was it to hear from the Greens that the Spirit ought to be parked in Hobart as a reminder, not for the benefit of the people of Tasmania, but the crass political purposes of the Tasmanian Greens. How shameful, but a wonderful insight into the political soul of the Greens that they would want things to occur for their own political advantage rather than holding advantage of the people of Tasmania?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left, if minister Abetz was not having so much fun, you would all be in trouble.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Ms Butler, you are already warned once. You are warned again.

Mr ABETZ - The option provided in relation to that offer that was made on 22 January provided a potential opportunity for $20 million to $30 million in revenue over a 12 month period. Further, as I have already indicated to the House, keeping the vessel in Leith, I am sure will prove to be cheaper than having her in Hobart - the reason being because your mates in the Maritime Union of Australia and elsewhere, very important, in Leith -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, Leader of the Opposition and Greens member for Clark.

Mr ABETZ - in Leith, to have the vessel alongside you need a six crew on board. When she comes to Hobart the requirement will be, I suspect, two to three times that number. The wages bill and the cost that the Labor Party and the Greens were wishing on Tasmanians was reckless, but that is what they wished for. Unfortunately, it seems that they will get it.

Time expired.

[11.45 a.m.]
Dr BROAD (Braddon) - Thank you, Speaker, and happy birthday. Have a great day. 

The SPEAKER - Thank you, it has been fantastic.

Dr BROAD - I cannot believe it. Here we are in parliament talking about the future of Spirits IV and V and we have the minister trying to blame everybody else for his own problems. It is pretty clear from today's Question Time that the future of Spirits IV and V is definitely under a cloud. The Premier will not rule out privatisation, so that is just such a devastating blow for the north-west coast. We love our Spirits. They made a huge difference to the state.

When Labor, despite Liberal opposition purchased the current Spirits, they revolutionised the north-west economy and that spread to the further state economy. They have been fantastic. What is the future of the Spirits IV and V? Their actual future is a long layover somewhere and a continuing international embarrassment. Making the BBC and so on has not put this government in a very good light, but I would like to remind the parliament, especially those people who have not been here perhaps as long as I have, that this saga stretches back some distance and that was highlighted a little bit by the member for Clark in her contribution.

First of all, the contract was let to FSG (Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft). They went broke and then the TT-Line went around and looked for another shipbuilder. They went to RMC and an MOU was signed and then we had this complete farce. The member for Clark talked about COVID being the reason why the project was delayed. It absolutely was not. It was because of the harebrained idea to get a Western Australian shipbuilder, Austal, to go from building catamarans to building their very first single-hull vessel in the Philippines then tow the hulk to Perth to be fitted out.
The spin doctors in Tasmania set to work and said what the government was doing was to build the new Spirits in Tasmania, which was never possible. As much as we would wish to have a massive shipbuilding industry in Tasmania, it simply is not possible. The modern industry does not suit startups building ships from scratch when we did not even have anywhere to park it, let alone an industry with the correct accreditations you need. The government eventually had to go back kicking and screaming to RMC. 

Eminent economist, Saul Eslake, provided a report to us which showed the devastating impact this whole farce and delay has caused to the Tasmanian economy. The contract was signed with RMC and then the price blew out. That is another couple of hundred million dollars. That was followed by a bailout TT-Line gave RMC when the shipbuilder was just about to go under. There is the cost blowout but, worst of all, the government simply forgot about getting a berth ready.

These are very specialised ships. These are RoPax vessels, which are not very common. They have night cabins and they have roll-on, roll-off capability. They have decks specially designed for the Tasmanian run. It is going to be fantastic when these ships eventually do operate, because every deck is over-height. It means you can put caravans, trucks and cars anywhere. This will revolutionise the north-west economy. That is why north-west tourism operators were getting ready. The future for the tourism operators in the north-west was looking very bright because the ships were supposed to be operating now. They have been let down. 

Worst of all, the government knew there were going to be delays to the Spirits. They knew they were not going to be ready in time and that there was nowhere to load and unload the ships. However, they did not tell the tourism operators, and they are paying for it. For example, Gavin Imlach, the caravan park operator at Latrobe, it is devastating his business. He has not received an apology from the government, that is for sure. He made ready but the government was not ready, and they did not build the berth. 

Now, when people have a look at the site there is a little bit of activity, but we are not seeing 24-hour action. We have billion-dollar assets on their way to Tasmania. Spirit IV is already built. Spirit V is going to start sea trials before long. There is a billion dollars' worth of assets coming to Tasmania now but there is nowhere to park them, and we are not seeing 24-hour action at the berth site in Devonport. If this government was up to it, they would be ensuring that there was 24-hour action to get that berth built as soon as possible.

[11.50 a.m.]
Mr WOOD (Bass) - Many happy returns, honourable Speaker. 

The arrival of the new purpose-built ships is a once-in-a-generation project. Our government knows how important these ships are to Tasmania. Make no mistake: these ships will be delivered under a Liberal government.

Dr Broad - Are you sure about that?

Mr WOOD - I am very sure. The new ships are not only important to the north-west of the state, but to the whole of Tasmania, with the growth in tourism and trade that results from these vessels. They will be a major contributor to Tasmania's visitor economy and the broader Tasmanian economy for many years to come. It is a transformative change for Tasmania, and we are delivering it. That is why it was only this government that committed to the significant investment, one of the largest investments in our history. We are committed to this investment because of the benefits to locals, employers and businesses who will reap the rewards. 

These brand-new Tasmanian icons will be longer and wider than the existing vessels, and will have substantially larger capacity for passenger vehicles, freight and, importantly, caravans. The Spirits are coming, we are preparing for their arrival, and we are excited to see it. Tasmanians rightly expect to see the new Spirits operating in Tasmania as quickly as possible. This is why our government is getting the berth 3 infrastructure project at Devonport on track, further reforming our government businesses and supporting our tourism and hospitality industry.

Work at berth 3 is progressing well, with fixed shore piling nearing completion, construction of the foundations for the southern retaining wall underway and concrete pouring to begin very soon. The sewer and stormwater works have been completed. Activity is happening off-site with a crane and a 48-metre-tall custom-made piling rig being mounted to a barge that will be used in the next stage of the construction. With activity set to ramp up on site over the coming weeks, work hours on site are set to be extended to ensure works can be completed quickly. 

This will be the permanent home of Spirits of Tasmania IV and V at the Devonport port. At almost double the size of the company's current lease, the new home will provide additional operational areas for passengers and freight customers. This is an exciting development and it will be fantastic to get it well and truly underway. While those opposite persist with their relentless negativity, we are getting on with delivering the job. We are pulling out all the stops to get this project delivered as soon as possible. 

Pleasingly, a number of local Tasmanian companies, BridgePro Engineering, Gradco and Vos Constructions, have been engaged in the delivery of berth 3 works alongside the main contractor, BMD Constructions, which delivered Spirit of Tasmania's Geelong port facility, and Fitzgerald Constructions Australia which also worked with BMD in Geelong. This is a further investment of over $100 million in Tasmanian companies, Tasmanian jobs and Tasmanian people. Around 75 per cent of the workforce delivering this infrastructure will be Tasmanians.

Local companies are already reaping the benefit of the new vessels, with an ever-increasing number of Tasmanian businesses securing contracts to supply the new vessels that are under construction. These include the provision of catering and hotel equipment, marine fire safety insulation material, carpet, marine blinds, arcade games, water-filling stations, artwork, beer and post-mix systems. For many of these businesses, it is not only the initial supply that is benefiting them, but also commitment for ongoing provisions of goods and services once the vessels are operating on Bass Strait. This provides a guaranteed source of work for these businesses and gives them certainty long term. TT-Line and RMC are continuing to work closely with other Tasmanian companies to provide further opportunities to supply locally manufactured goods and services. This is just another example of the Rockliff Liberal government and the TT-Line backing Tasmanian businesses.

As we approach 40 years since TT-Line commenced operations, the new vessels represent a commitment by this Liberal government to the next generation of Spirit travellers, growth in the Tasmanian economy, and the local employers and businesses who will reap the benefits.

[11.55 a.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I thank Mrs Pentland for bringing this motion on. It is important that we have this discussion today. I also thank the member for Bass, Mr Wood, for reminding me about the local content promise, because we have not discussed that since we returned to parliament.

The government promised $100 million worth of local content going into these ships. During the break, we saw the absurdity of the government claiming that anything made in Australia was local content - that it did not have to be Tasmanian - then going even further and listing engines built in Finland as local content in our ships. Therefore, it takes a lot of nerve to stand up in this place today and say, 'We are investing in local content', because it is another failure to deliver, another promise they made in an emergency situation that they could never deliver and they never did. 

The Minister for Transport spoke passionately today in defence of leasing our ships in Scotland, leaving them in the northern hemisphere. He named all the people, all the organisations that came to see the ships, as though that was a triumph in and of itself. He named that there were people who came to visit them, but what he did not say is what actually happened with the commercial negotiations. Who was TT-Line or the minister, Mr Abetz, or the Premier actually negotiating with? Was there ever any real negotiation? 

When the ABC checked it out with the Scottish Government, they said they wanted nothing to do with this idea. This is an idea that had previously been undertaken in Scotland where they tried to house refugees in a ship in Edinburgh, and it was a major political issue over there. We had organisations like the Red Cross saying, 'This is not the way to treat refugees'. It had already been tried and the government was not interested. Who was interested? Was anyone ever actually interested in this or was it just another ploy to keep our ship on the other side of the world for even longer? I suspect that this government has not told the whole truth on this matter. I think there are a lot more questions that need to be answered, particularly by Mr Abetz and Mr Rockliff in relation to this matter. 

However, the bigger issue I want to talk about is not just about Spirits IV and V. It is about our TT-Line, about how Tasmanians feel about the Spirit of Tasmania. I think the Premier has underestimated Tasmanians today. He called Hydro Tasmania a 'sacred cow'. I do not think he understands how much Tasmanians love our Spirits. We love our Spirits because we know what it did for our state. Our Spirits of Tasmania have been here delivering for our tourism industry, for our exporters. They have been delivering for Tasmanians who want to see the rest of the country. We love the Spirits. The Premier's refusal to rule out selling our ships today is shameful. It is disgraceful that he is considering selling our ships. 

This is a Premier and a government that could not buy the ships, then they bailed out a Finnish shipbuilder, then they could not build the berth, then they tried to lease them and could not do that either. They are now trying to sell them before they even arrive in Tasmania. This is a government that wants to sell our ships before they even arrive here. Spirit V is not even off the Finnish dock yet, it is not even doing sea trials, and it is up for sale by this Premier. He should take it off the table immediately. It is absolutely outrageous that our Tasmanian taxpayers have spent almost $1 billion on these ships, we bailed out a Finnish shipbuilder and before they even arrived, the for sale sign has gone up on the side.

They could not lease them, they never could, and now they want to sell them. Tasmanians will not stand for it. Tasmanians know the risks of privatisations right across government businesses, but particularly with this. They know that the risks here are that they will not do as many day sailings to support our tourism industry during summer months. They know the risk around fares for Tasmanians who just want to get on the ships with their caravan on the back and see the rest of the country, and good on them for doing that. They know the risks for our exporters around freight costs, which could go up because of privatisation of these assets. They know how important these ships have been for exporters who need to get fresh produce to the mainland as quickly as possible. 

These are the risks that the Premier exposed only two days ago, the risks he refuses to deal with when he answers questions. He needs to get better answers to these questions because Tasmanians will not stand for a premier who wants to sell off our assets to bail out his own budget. This is a mess that Mr Rockliff created: a mess the Liberals have built up over 11 years. It is not Tasmanians' fault. We should not have to sell our assets to bail them out. 

Matter noted.


PREMIER'S ADDRESS

Motion to Note

Resumed from 5 March 2025 (page 133).

The SPEAKER - Ms Finlay was on her feet and had 30 seconds left to go. She is not here, and by the time she gets here, we will run out of time anyway, so I will call the minister.

[12.01 p.m.]
Mr ELLIS (Braddon - Minister for Housing, Planning and Consumer Affairs) - Honourable Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in reply to the Premier's state of the state address. The Premier set out a strong vision for the future of Tasmania, not just for this year but for the years to come. The decisions we have made as a team, as a government and that we look forward to bringing back to the parliament are going to be critical as we look to set up Tasmania for the future in these years that follow the massive disruption of the COVID pandemic, and the devastating results and stories we heard during the commission of inquiry. It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that we can help drive those reforms, help drive Tasmania to a brighter future and continue to invest in the intergenerational infrastructure that will set up Tasmania for the decades to come. 

As part of that, the Premier has been clear that Tasmania needs to do the work, as other jurisdictions do around this country and around the world, to ensure that our budget is on a financially sustainable path. That is important. We have tackled enormous shocks and huge intergenerational legacies when it comes to COVID and the commission of inquiry, and a deficit when it comes to investing in the future of our people and our state in the way that they move around, the schools they learn in, the hospitals where they receive care and the emergency services that respond to the worst for our Tasmanians. Those investments, which we have been making across the 11 years of our government and will continue to make into the future, are important to ensure that Tasmania remains the best place to live, work and raise a family in the country.

The Premier outlines bold and ambitious reforms, ensuring that the public service is productive and efficient, that the Government Business Enterprises that serve Tasmania do so in a way that will deliver the best possible services for Tasmania and that we examine which Government Business Enterprises need to be in public hands. We have spoken in this place about a range of different options. 

It surprises me that the opposition would not even consider something like Momentum, which provides services not to Tasmanians, but to Victorians. In the past, when the Labor Party did have a shred of economic credibility, it even considered things like that - energy retailers and others. To go back to the dark old days of Labor economic incompetence shows just how trapped they are by their own ideology. They will not support us driving efficiency and productivity within the public service. They will not support us having a sensible look at our Government Business Enterprise ownership structures. They seemingly will not rule in or out new taxes. We have heard a range of different vague responses. The only thing those on the other side seem to think is their plan for fiscal sustainability in Tasmania is pushing up power prices and people's regos. Their plan is simply to drive up prices in fees and charges in our GBEs to everyday Tasmanians and that is somehow going to do the fiscal repair we need post-COVID and post-commission of inquiry.

The Leader of the Opposition spoke about how low rego prices are in Tasmania and, obviously, thank you, Tasmanian Liberal government and the Premier. If he is to do the work by taking all the other options off the table and simply focusing on driving greater profits for MAIB, Hydro, TasNetworks and others, the only way you can do that is jack up the prices and charges for Tasmanians - jack up their power prices, their transmission prices and rego. That is the only way that can be done. I think it shows why Labor did not trust themselves to form government, and they continue to not trust themselves to do so. That is why the Tasmanian people do not trust them either.

More broadly, this is a fundamental moment for the future of our state. We can be the best place to do business and invest in Australia. The Premier mentioned previously that we are ranked second by many measures, just behind South Australia. We think we can do even more. There have been 11 years of significant reform to make sure that Tasmania is a business-friendly environment that reversed the disastrous policies of the previous Labor-Greens government, where two out of three businesses in Tasmania thought the government was working against them. To do that, we need to continue the momentum. To get from number two to number one requires fundamental work. 

Many Tasmanians I speak to are excited about getting government off their back, ensuring that regulation is measured, appropriate, modest and sensible, and where there are opportunities for us to do things better, we should absolutely take them. In my portfolio of Housing, Planning and Consumer Affairs, we have outlined a range of different areas where this can be done. We have been upfront and really clear with people repealing, for example, the Local Government (Building and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1993, which is broadly described as one of the worst pieces of legislation on our statute books. That, in particular, is holding back the way we deliver subdivisions for Tasmanians. That is more homes we could be delivering if we do subdivisions better and aligned more strongly with our planning scheme.

Regulation is impacting construction of homes. Builders and the construction industry are waiting up to three weeks to get a rubber stamp from council for plumbing permits. We can do that better while ensuring that we maintain high standards and consumer protections. As a government we continue to look closely at where we can improve our processes and do things better.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=28.6_C=0.76] We are redrawing the line on the map that is the urban growth boundary. With that, I am looking forward to unlocking the potential of 10,000 homes in land in greater Hobart. That is an enormous opportunity. It comes from addressing the opportunities of cutting red tape and doing things better in our processes.

There are obviously massive opportunities for renewable energy investment. It was interesting to hear the shadow energy  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=59.5_D=29.9_C=0.68] spokesperson talking about how exciting it is to have so much energy investment on the books in Tasmania. I agree. I absolutely agree. I pay tribute to the energy ministers that we have had in our government who are helping to drive that vision for the future of our state.

We can do things even better. I announced that the Cellars Hill Wind Farm would be a major project and assessed under that pathway which our government delivered. That is a $1.5 billion investment in a regional  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=89.8_D=29.9_C=0.78] community in the Central Highlands that is going to create hundreds of jobs and 10 per cent of Tasmania's power. That is a great thing. We have helped to smooth the pathway for them. We also announced that we are going to add automatic qualification for those renewable energy projects that want to go through a major project pathway. That saves nearly two months of project planning time because they are able to immediately enter that pathway. That is a great thing for Tasmania. With time being money, it continues to show that we want to back investment in this state. We want to back our state to grow.

There are even bigger opportunities as we move closer to delivering the full statewide planning scheme. Most councils in Tasmania have been operating under this scheme for years. Sadly, there are still a couple of holdouts. They are the ones that have mayors who are either members of the Labor Party or members of the Greens. We look forward to those councils finally coming on board. The last of course will be Mr Winter's Kingborough Council, of which he was mayor. He was the significant block up for that project. I know why he thinks the statewide planning scheme does not exist and is not making benefits for Tasmania. It is because he is one of the few people not operating under that system, because he held it back. More broadly, we are excited about delivering the opportunities for Tasmanians as we bring in those last few major parts of our state. That includes the city of Hobart, the Derwent Valley, and  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=180.2_D=30.0_C=0.76] finally, we expect, down in Kingborough. That is going to be really exciting for everybody involved. 

We have also had our vision to deliver 10,000 social and affordable homes by 2032. I want to pay tribute to my predecessor, minister Barnett, now our Treasurer, who is backing home building around this state and has done for many, many years. We have delivered 4000 homes towards that target, which means that we are ahead of schedule and that we are performing strongly. We are unlocking opportunities for Tasmanians across the spectrum: affordable home ownership, affordable rentals, more social housing, more crisis accommodation for everyday Tasmanians and people who are victims of family violence.

We are also backing the opportunity for healthcare workers and other key workers in our economy to have a roof over their heads after they have done a hard day's work caring for people in our hospitals and other important public services. By backing those people who are looking to build homes or unlock land, or who are providing support to Tasmania's most vulnerable, the Homes Tasmania project is shining the way. I know that we receive strong feedback about this being a nation-leading model. We continue to want to work to improve that and grow that. 

Over the break I announced our new Chair, Ben Wilson.  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=258.0_D=30.0_C=0.81] Ben Wilson is a phenomenal Tasmanian, a man who has delivered the largest social and affordable program in Tasmania's history. He has extraordinary experience in the construction industry, in social and affordable homes, and in community housing providers. Ben has done incredible things with our Keystone board, and has been part of our reference groups already on Homes Tasmania. I am really looking forward to working with Ben to drive that vision forward. 

I pay tribute  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=288.3_D=16.7_C=0.68] to our outgoing Chair, Michele Adair, who was our inaugural chair and helped to establish Homes Tasmania. There is a review underway, and we are looking forward to seeing how we can even better deliver the opportunities that come from this exciting new model. I say to those Tasmanians out there who want a roof over their head: our government backs you in, whether your aspiration is to own your home, to rent, or if you need additional assistance through social and crisis accommodation support. We have an ambitious vision to grow our housing supply and affordability in Tasmania. We will do the heavy lifting through Homes Tasmania and will support our other Community Housing providers. We will also clear the path, cutting the red tape in planning, in construction, in licensing and delivering greater skills for our community, so that we can deliver those homes for everyday Tasmanians who want to unlock that aspiration of a roof over their head and a place to call home.

In terms of the opportunities for our emergency services, can I firstly pay tribute to our extraordinary firefighters for the work that they have been doing on the west coast, in Cradle Mountain, and of course at the Snug-Margate fires. These are some of the best of us. The people who pull on the uniform of our state do incredible work under trying conditions. They run towards the danger as others are coming away. Our community looks to them in their toughest moments.

The fires down the west coast, as part of the west coast complex, have burned about 100,000 hectares. We have had hundreds of volunteers and career staff who have stepped up to support Tasmania and protect the vital interests that we have in that part of the world. There are beautiful communities, whether they are shack communities or mining towns. There are massive economic drivers for our state, like Tasmania's largest mine at the Savage River Mine, or the Pieman Scheme at the Bastyan Dam and the Reece Dam. There is a range of important tourism assets around the Cradle Mountain area, and important ecological natural values in that part of the world that our firefighters have done such an extraordinary job to protect.

This really has been a team Tasmania effort. It has been delivered through our three fire agencies: the Tasmanian Fire Service, Sustainable Timber Tasmania and the Parks and Wildlife Service. We pay tribute to each and every one of those people who wear the uniform of our state. We also thank all our other partners in emergency response through the SES, Tasmania Police, Ambulance Tasmania and others.

We also pay tribute to those who have come from near and far to serve in our state for the benefit of our country - people from New South Wales, Queensland and other places. We recognise the flooding that has happened in Queensland and the cyclone that is bearing down on them. Some of those people who will be filling sandbags today have been supporting our firefighters in recent weeks on the west coast. We cannot be more grateful for their service to our state. People have come from overseas as well. We pay tribute to the New Zealanders, who, in true ANZAC spirit, have been there at the base camp in Tullah and served in the Tasmanian bush to protect Tasmanian lives and Tasmanian livelihoods. It is really an extraordinary thing to watch the way that we are able to bring these services together for the benefit of the Tasmanian community.

More broadly, we have a big and important plans in this space as we continue to invest and grow our fire and emergency services. We will be rolling out important investments in the future of our state. This includes the north-west day crew, and Emergency Services Hubs in Kingston, Wynyard and Rosebery: those kinds of investments that back our volunteers. Our $10 million volunteer infrastructure fund has upgraded stations and units right around the state in every corner, in stations big and small. We have backed in our volunteers.

We recently opened the Campbell Town Fire Brigade. I pay tribute to my predecessor, Mark Shelton and the other members for Lyons who supported it. The Campbell Town Fire and SES complex is a demonstration of what can be achieved when we work together. There are investments to ensure that we have a strong emergency response where trucks can get out the door and serve the community. We are backing our growing cohort of female volunteers, with more accessible and female-friendly amenities. We are protecting our first responders through personal protective clothing (PPC) separation and other measures. These kinds of investments will continue. We will continue to back them in Tasmania.

In terms of our law enforcement who keep us safe, I want to pay tribute to Tasmania Police and their incredible efforts. We have recently received a notification that Tasmania Police is the most trusted police force in the country. They are the most likely to act with honesty and professionalism. They are the most likely to support their communities. The data that was displayed through the report on government services shows clearly that Tasmania's finest are Australia's most trusted.

Even more than that, it demonstrates that our investments are working. The data clearly shows that Tasmania invests more in police per capita than any state in Australia. The reason why we do that, despite having safe communities, is because investing ahead of time helps to deliver those outcomes. Other states defunded their police and look what happened - the breakdown of law and order in places like the NT, Queensland, the youth crime explosion that we are seeing in Victoria with a nearly 100 per cent increase in crime.

In Tasmania, we are seeing some of the effects of COVID with mental health challenges for our young people. We are seeing the damaging impact of posting and boasting on social media. Our government has a strong plan to continue to employ more police - a record number of police delivered now in Tasmania - but a record of recruitment ahead because we know that those people who protect Tasmania should be supported as we continue our growing state and as we continue to want to keep them safe.
We have a significant pipeline of legislative reform to be tough on crime and to protect victims in Tasmania. Today, of course, we welcomed the extraordinary Ludwig family, particularly Laraine and Matilda, in support of Reid's Law. Reid was a father of two who was killed in 2019 at Blackmans Bay, the victim of a knife attack. 

Reid's Law will be an important piece of us being able to ensure that there are greater penalties for people who carry knives and other weapons in public places and greater powers for our police to search those who might do our community harm. I pay tribute to the Beasley Family and the Jack Beasley Foundation who lost their son Jack in similar circumstances and have led this movement across our country. 

There are other reforms as well that we will be doing to keep Tasmanians safe, ensuring that there is a sex offender disclosure scheme through the Community Protection (Offender Reporting) Act so that people are empowered with the information they need to keep their children safe against sex predators. We will be delivering anti-hooning reform so that we can crack down on hoons by making it easier to crush and confiscate their vehicles and also by ensuring that we are getting the hoons off the road, not only their cars. Vehicles can be a deadly weapon, particularly when they are in the hands of people doing the wrong thing. We will continue to bring forward this important legislation into our parliament.

Finally, with skills and jobs, our government continues to lead an enormous reform so that we can address the largest schools and labour shortage that we have seen in our country in more than 100 years, supporting major new investments at the north-west Clean Energy Centre of Excellence that has been backed by the federal government - a $27 million investment in the north-west to go with the Water and Energy Trade Centre of Excellence in the south.

We want to ensure that we can continue to build the workforce to build Tasmania's future. We backed the Civil Contractors Federation with Tasmania's first Earthworks Academy so that people who are operating heavy vehicles in the civil construction industry, forestry, mining, agriculture and a whole range of other workplaces are able to get the tickets they need so that they can build Tasmania's future. Our jobs plan is backing skills for jobs and ensuring that we have a more connected and integrated system so that the learner is at the centre of our system and the centre of everything that we do when it comes to training our high-vis army. The Premier has spoken about the Liberal government being the best friend of people who pull on high-vis. With our $10 million investment in the high-vis army, that has now expanded even further. It is an exciting time for tradies in Tasmania.

Speaker, I commend the state of the state address to this House and for the work that it will set up for this year and many years to come for the people of Tasmania.

Time expired.

[12.20 p.m.]
Ms BUTLER (Lyons) - Deputy Speaker, the minister, Mr Ellis, could have had a different career in calling horses. Sometimes listening to your speeches - you do not draw a breath, do you? Woo. That was a lot. 

I will start with a warm welcome to Casey Farrell, who had his first day in the Chamber yesterday. I am looking forward to his inaugural speech. I am excited because Casey is joining the Lyons team and that is a wonderful inclusion. He is very experienced and positive. I have known Casey for many years. He will bring a different and a new skill-set to our already incredibly dynamic and amazing team. We are hungry and we are building every day. While the wheels are falling off the minority government, we are getting stronger and stronger and ready to step in and govern Tasmania. I think that will not be too far in the distance.
		
		Tasmanians have a clear choice at the moment. They can stick with a minority Liberal government that is worn out and full of in-fighting from what we can hear and see - and incompetence. There are so many mistakes. There are also the one-liners: 'Get your PR people to come up with a bit of spin' or, 'My 10 advisers have said to say this, minister'. It can only go for so long. Then it gets to a stage where you cannot hide that any more from the public and that is really what we have been seeing. There is that cycling of governments. It does happen in the Westminster system and that is very much what we are experiencing now - a minority Liberal government that really cannot be trusted with the finances or major infrastructure projects.
		
		The Labor party has a proven track record of paying off Liberal debt. That is always what we have done in this state. Then we build the big projects and we drive our state forward. That is the cycle of what happens in Tasmania. We think this minority Liberal government has lost touch with Tasmanians. We are also seeing day after day things that you think: 'Gosh, did they make that up, or you would not read about that'. They keep being announced by this government. 
		
		Even this week there have been a few more surprises, and a few more were in the state of the state address by Mr Rockliff. I could tell he was embarrassed having to make that speech. I could tell that he probably did not want to make that speech. It was short, compared to previous state of the state addresses. It almost felt like Treasury had finally come and knocked on the door and said: 'Enough is enough. It really is time for you to be honest with the people of Tasmania about just how bad the finances are. You cannot keep coming up with one-liners and telling everyone everything is good because there is so much compelling evidence to suggest that it is a mess'.
		
		What a state our state is in. I will quote from the Premier from his state of the state address, when he said people want government out of their lives. That is what he said in his state of the state speech. My understanding, after the ferry fiasco, the number of Liberal members under investigation by the Integrity Commission, the woeful economic outlook for our beautiful state, is that the people of Tasmania will probably also want this government out of their lives.
		
		Today we learnt that this minority government is seriously considering selling our Spirits of Tasmania IV and V, selling the TT-Line. We are an island state. Those ferries are part of our cultural identity. These jokers have decided and have not said that it is off the table to sell the Spirits of Tasmania. They have not even arrived here yet and they have not been able to arrive and function properly because this Liberal minority government did not build a berth for them. It is, by far, Tasmania's biggest infrastructure disaster ever. You can put lipstick on a pig and try to dress it up to make it look like there is something positive that can come out of it, but we are literally losing millions of dollars while our billion-dollar beautiful Spirits are sitting overseas. One of them has not even conducted sea trials yet, and you are seriously considering selling the TT-Line, privatising our publicly owned assets. It is just an absolute disgrace.
		
		As I stated before, I thought the Premier was embarrassed. It was a combination of click-size one-liners. It also felt like little snapshots that the PR team could put up on the social media reels, which he seems to be doing quite a bit of at the moment. There was one I saw the other day where he was indulgently having a coffee with his former self, I think it was. I did not understand it when I was first looking at it. I thought, 'What is going on? Is he having a coffee with his son? Is that what this is about? The "family man" angle?'. Then I realised, no, it is meant to be him having a coffee with his younger self. I know we are all up for different approaches but come on.

You have a state that now has the worst performing economy in the country. You have a team that is falling apart. You have beautiful Spirit of Tasmania boats sitting overseas because you have not been able to build the berthing facilities for them, lied about why it was not done in time, covered it all up - no transparency - and you are making little video reels about having a coffee with yourself. I do not know. You may think it is quirky, but I thought it was quite disgraceful.

Mr Barnett - Why were you not part of the TikTok video? Why were you not there?

Ms BUTLER - I will have you withdraw that. I was not in that video, thank you. Could he please withdraw that? Can I ask that he withdraw that?

Mr Barnett - I am just saying why were you not there?

Ms BUTLER - Can he withdraw that? I was not in it. Do not misrepresent me, Mr Barnett.

Mr Barnett - I said why were you not there.

Ms BUTLER - Absolutely not - I am not going to be misrepresented.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - It needs to be something that the member takes offence to for me to have to ask the Attorney-General to -

Ms BUTLER - I do take offence because I was not in a TikTok video.

Mr BARNETT - Through you, Deputy Speaker, I was asking the question 'why were you not there?' and I acknowledge -

Ms BUTLER - That is not what you said, minister.

Mr BARNETT - That is what I did. I asked that question. I acknowledge that you were not there.

Ms BUTLER - Thank you.

Mr Barnett - Thank you for your response. Indeed, it is quite telling.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order. The member for Lyons has the call. Before, actually -

Ms BUTLER - Can the clock stop, please?
DEPUTY SPEAKER - I will stop the clock for a moment. I will remind the House - well, the Speaker has reminded me - that those who were warned during question time, those warnings still stand. That applies to everybody who received one. 

Ms BUTLER - We do not support privatisation, Mr Barnett, of our state-owned assets; a sale to inject funds into our flailing economy due to your mismanagement. You are the Treasurer, Mr Barnett. At least the Premier is finally admitting, as the Treasurer still has not done, 'Houston, we have a massive problem here in Tasmania'. However, in typical - just coming out with different rhetoric and one-liners, I recall Mr Barnett - or the Treasurer - said our economy is as large as it has ever been and we have continued to grow despite economic challenges.

What does that say, Treasurer? Did someone in your office come up with a one-liner that says nothing at all and does not even go near the huge economic problem that we have in Tasmania? We will have $10 billion worth of debt, Treasurer, by the time of the next election, $10 billion in debt. We only have a population over 600,000 people. You said in your media release the day before yesterday that our economy is as large as it has ever been and we have continued to grow despite economic challenges. It means nothing. It is just more treasurer words. 

The other one I really liked the other day was 'plotting a strategy to surplus'. That begs the question - 'I am plotting a strategy', so, 'I am thinking about developing a strategy about how we might be able to get to surplus one day'. Is that what that means? Another zinger, another one-liner, Treasurer - it is so ridiculous and pathetic and completely out of touch with what is going on with the Tasmanian economy. We have some of the most vulnerable people in the country living in Tasmania. Some of the areas in Lyons, an electorate we share, have some of the highest disadvantage indicators in the country and all you can come up with is the rhetoric 'plotting a strategy to surplus'. I truly believe the people of Tasmania, who rely on you and this minority government to manage this economy deserve better than silly one-liners.

Another thing I want to discuss today - and it was really good to hear the minister for Police, Mr Ellis, talk with so much pride about the Tasmanian police service, which he often refers to as a 'force' when they are not a force. You would think he would get that bit right, seeing he is the minister for Police. However, what the minister failed to talk about today was that this government has cut $35 million from the police budget.

This government has also ignored for some time what the police have been asking for  and will continue to ask for because 15 per cent of our Tasmanian police service are on workers compensation at the moment. It is a huge problem that they have been trying to address for many years. They had some progress. I believe there was even an election announcement from the government about the world-class or nation-leading rosters. Suddenly, we may not be doing the nation-leading rosters any more for the Tasmanian police service, even though 80 per cent of police officers responding to that survey about the wellbeing rosters, about the four-by-four and six-by-six rosters, all responded to that survey by saying they supported it because it assisted them in their health and wellbeing. It assisted them to be able to do the jobs that they do. They fill in all the gaps where your government services are currently underfunded and unable to perform. Tasmania Police do that.

Now, 80 per cent of those police officers - actually, I believe it is more than 80 per cent - agreed that they want those rosters to be trialled. Tasmanian Labor will continue to support the Police Association of Tasmania, unlike you. We will continue to listen to those officers. We are visiting police stations all around the state at the moment. We are three-quarters of the way through. This is over the last seven or eight months. When we get to the end, we are going to start again because we are in touch with the Tasmanian police service and the officers on the ground.

We are listening to what they are telling us, and what they are telling us is they want rostering systems that work for them, Mr Ellis. I do not know why you are not listening to them. It is really important to them. To go back to the antiquated Ottawa system, when you have a retention issue down the track - because for the last two years they have been on a trial system, which they are happy with, so all the new recruits coming in are on the six-by-six and four-by-four - if they are taken back to the Ottawa system, our information from people who we have surveyed and the Police Association of Tasmania (PAT) is that that will lead to further resignations. These are new recruits coming through. This is the rostering system that has been in place on trial for two years. Minister, you need to listen to them.

I know you have cut their budget by $35 million. I know you are saying that you might be able to pull landlines off desks and restrict travel for police. I know you are relocating some offices into other buildings to save money on rent, but that is not going to find $35 million worth of savings. You have not been honest about who are essential and non-essential workers. None of you has. This needs to be resolved. You need to back police officers. You cannot stand up here in parliament or make speeches at these events that we attend, saying that you support when, obviously, you do not. Otherwise, you would have stepped in for them on their behalf.

We all know in this room the work that they face every day. We all know the huge percentage of people on those workers compensation claims are there because of mental health issues. Their mental health is constantly tested. They are facing things on a daily basis that not many people in this room would want to face. They are the people who are at the coalface with our car accidents. They are the people at the coalface when we have family violence incidents. Over 50 per cent of their time at the moment is attending family violence incidents just because of the sheer amount of time and expertise it takes. I implore the minister to seriously think about [Bookmark: Phr2_O=14.4_D=15.9_C=0.77]  listening to the PAT and backing them for the police rosters. The 6 by 6/4 by 4 needs to be put into place. It was promised as nation-leading rostering. It was promised to look after their wellbeing.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=34.8_D=29.1_C=0.80] The other issue that I would like to discuss while I have a few minutes is the sheer amount of wastage that we have had to put up with here because of this government's mismanagement. I am very concerned about you potentially privatising the MAIB. I am very concerned about the amount of money for all the dividends that come from MAIB to police so the Road Safety Task Force can [Bookmark: Phr4_O=64.1_D=30.0_C=0.81]  conduct the traffic. You have not discussed at all what it would mean if the MAIB was sold off. 

We know that if the MAIB was sold off, average car registration in Tasmania will increase - our leader Dean Winter was talking about this this morning. This is something that is really going to hit the belt for many people, especially young people and a lot of people who cannot afford or find it very hard to meet the cost of car registration every year anyway. The average car registration in Tasmania costs  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=94.3_D=17.8_C=0.80] $590. In Queensland it is $814. In New South Wales it is $1020. In the ACT, registering a vehicle costs nearly $1200, double what it does in Tasmania. That  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=113.3_D=29.0_C=0.82] is because of privatisation. All those states have a privatised system.

If you want to grab that $2 billion that is sitting there in the kitty, if that is what you want to do, to try to buy your way out of all the terrible decisions you have made with managing the budget over the last 11 years, that is a real cheap trick. Tasmanians cannot afford for their registrations to double. They really cannot.

I am going to quickly talk about Metro [Bookmark: Phr7_O=142.7_D=29.5_C=0.87] . Many people in the community of Lyons rely solely on Metro for transport. One in three people who live in Bridgewater do not drive cars; they rely on buses. It is really important to have public transport. Public transport is a service to a community. It is not something to be made a profit out of. I have spoken about that in this Chamber many times over the years. I can also say that if you look at other states, they  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=172.5_D=30.0_C=0.81] run train systems, comprehensive ferry systems, interstate train systems, light rail, trams. All you had to do was run one public transport system - bus services. That was all you had to do. You do not even have to do it throughout the whole state. You just do them in concentrated, built-up areas.

Without a public transport system, fares will go up. Many people in our communities  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=202.6_D=28.1_C=0.73] have already suffered from you not being able to manage a public transport system properly, with buses not turning up. You have not even put screens in those Metro buses yet to protect those drivers. That is pathetic. That was promised about two years ago. I am really sick of you blaming driver shortage for all the issues you have had in Metro. What are you going to do? You are just going to sell it. You are going to sell it to a private company. It is disgraceful. I implore you to think more  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=231.5_D=17.8_C=0.77] about this approach. We will not be supporting privatisation at all.

As our deputy leader said this morning, you are going to need a very big table if the only thing that you have kept off the table is Hydro. Even then, there are sections of Hydro that I think you have already mentioned could be up for sale.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=250.3_D=12.2_C=0.86] Please do not even think about privatising the Spirits of Tasmania. There would be no way you would ever get support from the people of Tasmania to do that. It is disgraceful that it is on the table.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=264.1_D=13.7_C=0.76] I would be absolutely devastated if you even thought that that was a potential way to build you out of this budget mess you put yourself in. 

Time expired.

[12.41 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=283.2_D=9.5_C=0.78] Ms BURNET (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to respond to the Premier's state of the state  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=294.4_D=10.3_C=0.86] address from Tuesday. I acknowledge the contributions already in this House, but particularly from my Greens colleagues, and Ms Rosol's to come. There have been some very good things that have been raised in relation to what the Premier has said.

The state of the state address is like a report card on how well the government is travelling. I will start by posing the question: what are the hallmarks of good government? What is it that they should be marked against? What do the people of Tasmania expect the government to deliver on?

Here are 10 principles of success in government. It is not an exhaustive list, but it is a considered list nevertheless. First there is, of course, good governance. Over the summer break I have been reading the writings of Sam Freedman, who has written a book called Failed State. It is all about the government of the UK and how we can learn from some of those mistakes made in government.
Second, there is making reparation with the Palawa people. Third in my list of what I think government should be measured against is delivering for the community, especially those vulnerable members of our community. Fourth is reducing the risk of intergenerational debt. Fifth is fiscal responsibility. Sixth is building society, not tearing it down, by making sure that we have strong public institutions. Seventh is reducing inequality and improving tolerance. Eighth is improving environmental stewardship and responding to climate change. Ninth is balancing the interests of business, community and various interest groups. Tenth is being generous with knowledge, and honest and open.

The Premier should be leading this work, but we all have a part to play. We should use the short time we have in parliament to make sure we use every second we have to serve the people and not our own interests, or play petty games of one-upmanship. I do not envy the Premier. He has come into the role at the tail end of an 11-year government that must take responsibility for some major disasters. The Premier talked of the post-pandemic malaise, but did not mention the uncertainty of current geopolitics that impacts us all and will no doubt deliver more turmoil in the years to come.

The state of the state address is a chance to shine almost one year into a term, to lay out the plan for the year, and to reflect on the year past. What did we witness? How is the good ship Tasmania travelling? What is the government doing to protect those important things for Tasmanians, our environment and economy? How are the scorecards against those 10 points I mentioned before?

Everyone is aware of the economic disaster our state is sailing towards. We are sailing towards an $8.6 billion debt in forward estimates, reduced credit status pushing up the cost of servicing our loans, the Spirits budget well and truly blown, and the billion-dollar Macquarie Point Stadium emerging as a bottomless pit of debt with costs unannounced but still climbing.

Instead of that time for reflection and thoughtful response in readiness for challenges ahead, the Premier reached for that old playbook: kick the living daylights out of the public service and privatise our public institutions. You cannot think that is actually a boost to the economy, as the TCCI seems to think and back in. You cannot think that this move would in any way be a winner to reduce costs, as I will outline in a moment.

We are looking at 2500 public sector jobs already on the chopping block, 1900 of which are in the health service. There are efficiency dividends, which were slated in the September budget by the Treasurer reaching across all government agencies, a Kafkaesque EPU, like DOGE in the United States, set up to find efficiencies. This undermining of the public sector and its workers is an appalling tactic by any government, which unions representing their workers will not accept. Add to this the list of privatisation of government assets and institutions that the Premier announced. It is absurd.

How well does it work? Are services guaranteed? What happens when private organisations providing essential services decide their bottom line is not good enough? We do not have to look too far into the past. In fact, this week the private operator Healthscope decided that the maternity services it runs in one of our private hospitals are not turning enough profit and it will not be providing that service anymore. Even as a donor to the Liberal party, there is no guarantee required that you will meet those demands and it falls back to public services and another private operator literally holding the baby.

That is how privatisation of what has been a public service works. The knock-on effect - people leave their professions. While not necessarily a direct response, but as a case in point, we saw on the front page of today's Mercury that obstetrician, Dr Irena Nikakis, saying what others are probably thinking, that she is going to leave the part of work that she loves because those services are not going to be provided. What could be more essential than women's health and maternity services? What is the government doing to make sure that those services are available?

If you think about TasRail, we heard last year, even before we were looking at the governance restructuring and looking at the governance of our GBEs and state-owned companies, that there was a consideration by the government, or an announcement that there would be a merger of TasRail, TT-Line, and TasPorts. Not even having done that governance work, they are talking about a merger of three government-owned entities.

As a reminder, the Tasmanian Government Railways was formed in 1872. We are going right back in history here. In 1975, there was the Railways Tasmania Act, and in 1978 all services were absorbed into the National Railway Network and there was a rapid decrease in demand for passenger services as car ownership grew. In 1978, services were operated by ATN TasRail, which was federal, and in 1997 they were sold to the Australian Transport Network (ATN). Then ATN was sold to Pacific National in 2004 and, lo and behold, in 2007 the Tasmanian government takes responsibility for tracks and infrastructure. Then, in 2009, the Rail Company Act, Tasmanian government purchases, or rather, repurchases our railways and trains and TasRail was formed.

It is a case in point, is it not? An announcement about privatisation does not bode well. It can be very costly for our government when we have these things before us and these decisions. It is not a sure-fire way to make money. In fact, it is quite dangerous. If you think of the assets that are in Tasmania's hands, then you take them away, you do not have them ever again, until you have to buy them again, which is such a costly way of doing business.

I cannot fathom the Premier's logic. Instead of systematically looking at the most costly projects and seeing whether he can or should afford them, as you might do - and this has been raised by the member for Bass in relation to the comparison to household budgets - you look at whether you can afford them, and what alternatives are available, but the Premier has not done this. He has avoided this kind of scrutiny and this systematic approach to how you might manage your economy. It is a state economy about which we are talking.

He does not want to cut his losses with Mac Point's growing $1 billion-plus price tag, nor does he want Saul Eslake to look at this as part of the brief. He did not even mention it in his speech, but the Greens will continue to highlight what a waste of money the billion-dollar stadium at Mac Point is to our economy. It would be number one on the list of things to look at if I were looking at a responsible government on the government benches, but Mac Point does have alternatives. It is an easy example of a project you could abandon before spending a red cent more. The many years undertaking remedial work would not go to waste. The around about six hectares could be used as something more accessible and beneficial for all Tasmanians who visit that area. It could even consider multi-residential housing and public facilities as was first mooted, as well as the Antarctic Division headquarters. There is over a billion dollars of debt wiped just like that. We could stop subsidising big salmon, Sustainable Timber Tasmania and other extractive industries.

What of the billion-dollar infrastructure pipeline? Health analyst, Martyn Goddard, believes that infrastructure priorities are skewed. There is too much in the 10-year $30 billion pipeline. There are 442 projects, mostly public, and they inevitably take tradies from other pressing infrastructure projects like building housing. In reality, those infrastructure projects, undertaken with a review of arrangements with the federal government, will no longer be an 80/20 split in favour of Tasmania. It is more likely to be 50/50, as the federal government has said. Imagine applying this difference to the three-quarters-of-a-billion-dollar Bridgewater bridge project and other projects such as that.

A scan of today's papers will show you that a $130 million upgrade of York Park is occurring. It has just been approved, I believe, by the Launceston City Council. It is occurring already, so why is the government not finding savings through reprioritising projects that are not a higher priority and withdrawing that money and funding for the Mac Point project?

We have seen de-investment in institutions such as TAFE, which happened years ago.

Mr Ellis - Rubbish.

Ms BURNET - Sorry?

Mr Ellis - Rubbish.

Ms BURNET - There has been de-investment over many years, even before your time, Mr Ellis, and TAFE has become much less of an organisation over those years. It has been legislated to make it a not-for-profit. If you are a TAFE employee, you are no longer a state public servant. It is under Fair Work that your conditions apply. TAFE has been run down. It is public institutions that are continually neglected by this government. Governments such as this government tend to neglect organisations which should be strong and robust. The case that springs to mind - and it was mentioned in the Premier's speech - is that Metro is continually underfunded. It is a situation where we see underfunding, we do not see priorities of security for drivers, we see services cut, we see a lack of frequency, and a lack of regularity. It is very hard to predict a service that is rundown. It is not invested in as much as it should be.

The quality of a city - and if you have travelled, as I am sure you have, Deputy Speaker - those cities that are great have fantastic public transport systems. They have systems that are joined up and obviously invested in. Here, we have the shame of a lack of investment in Metro. This is seen as a reason to privatise it. It is something that is not fathomable if you were really looking after your people, the Tasmanian population, who need to rely on a public transport system that is strong and robust.

We could do well to focus on cities as solutions to some of the other critical issues that we face, improving housing, and improving the economy to reduce energy demands in a carbon-constrained economy in the face of climate change. It is part of your electorate and it is part of mine - we could consider the Northern Suburbs Transit Corridor as a model project to tick those boxes of making sure that there is good urban design and a robust renewal project that we can all be proud of.

It would be good to have those ferries, light rail, whatever it takes, to have a robust and reliable public transport system. A movement into austerity, at the same time swinging at anyone who might take a different view on slashing public service jobs, providing uncertainty for workers across all government agencies, from Smithton to Geeveston and from Launceston to Hobart and everywhere in between, is not good enough. It is not acceptable.

Hobart is a public service town. Take the RHH, which is the biggest employer. With efficiency dividends, vacancy control, and the Rockliff razor gang, you can kiss job security goodbye. With job cuts, you can expect to see a downturn -

PREMIER'S ADDRESS

Motion to Note

Resumed from above.

[2.30 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, the Premier's state of the state address leaves a lot to be desired. I have not even mentioned the State of the Environment Report and the fragmentation that our land use planning is responsible for, or the degradation of some of our land at the fringes of our cities and settlements. It is not good enough to just think that privatisation is the best thing for our state institutions. I wonder what the State Service review is doing, languishing. It is going to be repeated by perhaps another consultant. Perhaps the government is looking at spending more money on consultants and reducing the impact of those services that are already in place. It is very disappointing. The Greens will be there to stand up for Tasmanians and the Tasmanian environment. 

[2.31 p.m.]
Mr WOOD (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise in response to the Premier's state of the state address. I commend the Premier, Mr Rockliff, on his address, for his steadfast vision for Tasmania, his strong leadership when faced with challenges and his determination to take action and get on with fixing things. At a time when Tasmania and Australia face economic uncertainty, cost-of-living pressures and the need for critical investment in infrastructure, health and education, the Premier has outlined a clear plan to ensure our state remains strong, resilient and prosperous.

The Premier's commitment to cutting red tape, streamlining government services and ensuring responsible financial management is exactly what Tasmania needs to support businesses, create jobs and deliver the essential services our communities rely on. This government is focused on solutions, not excuses; on progress not politics. While others engage in negative actions, we are focused on delivering real outcomes for Tasmanians. 

Three years ago I was elected to this House as a member for Bass. I have driven around almost every corner of my electorate. I have spoken with hundreds of Tasmanians; to owners of businesses large and small, new and established; to community groups; and of course our most valued volunteers. Through these conversations, one thing has become clear. Tasmanians want action. They want a government that listens and delivers real solutions. They have told me about the many challenges they face: red tape holding back businesses and the need for better infrastructure and services. They want their hard work to be rewarded, their communities to thrive and their families to have access to the best opportunities available.
These people and their belief that Tasmania is the best place to live, invest, do business and thrive is a clear reflection of the government's commitment to ensuring Tasmania's future is strong. The community of Bass is strong and resilient. It is full of quiet achievers doing amazing things, and fierce advocates of business and industry, ensuring opportunities for growth and development continue in the region. Let us be honest, Bass is easily the best place in Tasmania and I say that with absolutely no bias whatsoever. Community groups and volunteers meet the needs of their communities with enthusiasm, enhancing the supports provided by organisations and the government. It has been a privilege to see the pride in which community groups share their stories and showcase their projects, all driven by the determination to strengthen their people and their area.

I have been pleased to support a number of these organisations by being a collection point for the Beaconsfield Fire Brigade Christmas gift drive, the St Vincent de Paul Society school supplies drive and the Tassie Mums coat drive, enabling community donations to be gathered in a central location. The new Exeter Show and Recreation Centre is a clear example of the community working together to achieve a goal. From concept plan to completion, this dedicated group of volunteers has lobbied local, state and federal representatives to ensure their vision for the Exeter Showgrounds came to fruition. A special shout-out to Trevor Clark, who was really instrumental in bringing that centre forward. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=20.0_D=16.3_C=0.84]  With funding support from all levels of government, fundraising and in-kind support, this outstanding facility was recently opened, providing the Tamar Valley with a much-needed modern space that will meet the needs of local sporting groups and the community more widely. 

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=38.3_D=7.3_C=0.87] Community groups often need small amounts of money to complete projects of significance to their communities.  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=46.8_D=20.5_C=0.76] I have successfully advocated for grants for the Scottsdale Men's Shed to replace tools that were, unfortunately, stolen; for a defibrillator for the Launceston Croquet Club; and for the Tamar Sea Rescue Club to replace the outboard motors on their main rescue boat and heat pumps in their home base.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=69.4_D=7.2_C=0.89] There are many amazing events across the region, coordinated by dedicated committees:  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=77.5_D=9.4_C=0.70] such as the Scallop Fiesta, Festivale and BeerFest, all of which are supported with funding from Events Tasmania.  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=88.3_D=9.2_C=0.85] Events assist in building the profile of the region and attracting visitors, ensuring accommodation providers are at capacity and venues booked out. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=99.3_D=22.5_C=0.84]  The events showcase local food and beverage businesses, support service clubs, raise funds for their local projects and provide a platform for our upcoming talented musicians and entertainers. It is great to see the calendar full of options for locals and visitors alike, not just over summer but all year round.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=123.5_D=21.7_C=0.73] There are a number of significant local projects underway in Bass that have been achieved with our advocacy. Just around the corner from my electorate office in Kings Meadows sits the Kings Meadows Bowls Club. Last week the club commenced work on a major redevelopment project to upgrade the facilities, with a contribution of $980,000 from this government. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=148.0_D=22.4_C=0.76]  The improvements at the Kings Meadows Bowls Club and other community facilities across Bass, including installation of synthetic greens at Exeter and Invermay bowls clubs and upgrades to the clubhouse facilities at the Lilydale Football Club, are all important to the longevity and success of these clubs. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=171.3_D=21.1_C=0.87] 

These developments are much more than the physical improvement of sports facilities. They assist clubs to attract new members, creating more opportunities to connect and develop meaningful relationships with like-minded people, which, in turn, enhances their mental, social and physical wellbeing. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=193.3_D=6.6_C=0.85]  The flow-on effect is wider still. Strong sports clubs support local businesses and provide a boost [Bookmark: Phr13_O=200.1_D=2.2_C=0.95]  to the economy of the region [Bookmark: Phr14_O=203.3_D=13.9_C=0.84] . The community is also strengthened by more active and motivated members who have had the opportunity to take on leadership and mentoring roles, skills that are transferrable to many other aspects of community and business life. 

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=219.0_D=11.3_C=0.74] Alongside our community sports facilities are larger sports hubs that are vital to supporting the increasing number of participants, particularly our wonderful junior athletes. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=232.1_D=11.8_C=0.82]  New projects and significant upgrades to a number of facilities in northern Tasmania will ensure our sports-loving community are training and playing in venues that are fit for purpose.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=245.5_D=12.0_C=0.83] The $130 million transformation of UTAS Stadium, for instance, includes brand-new additional spectator stands, the revitalisation of several existing stands and a new entry plaza.  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=258.7_D=18.2_C=0.67] Upon completion, this will firmly place Launceston as a hub for national sporting and entertainment events, providing an economic boost to our local businesses and tourism sector. The transformation of UTAS Stadium is a real game changer, literally. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=277.7_D=19.3_C=0.82]  I am thrilled that we are maintaining our valuable connection with the Hawthorn Football Club through a sponsorship agreement extending into the 2026-27 seasons. Each game is a significant economic driver for the community, creating an estimated $46 million of economic activity. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=298.0_D=2.2_C=0.70]  That is certainly worth celebrating.

 [Bookmark: Phr21_O=301.7_D=3.2_C=0.91] I also recently attended the opening of the Launceston Tennis Community and Events Centre after its recent redevelopment, providing facilities for local tennis players and clubs, a hub for major tennis events including the Launceston International, which was held there last week, as well as being a multipurpose sport and community space. 

The Northern Suburbs Community Recreation Hub is another project underway in northern Tasmania. This space includes four indoor netball courts, three multi-use courts for basketball, volleyball and other sporting and community recreational activities, a gymnastics area, a gym along with a cafe, multipurpose office spaces and open spaces suitable for large community gatherings. The hub will provide much-needed relief to the court shortage challenge facing a number of associations, and enhanced access to recreation opportunities for residents of our northern suburbs. I look forward to seeing the completion of this project later this year.

Basketball is a growing sport, with more than 3500 registered participants across 630 teams. We know a lack of courts is one of the biggest barriers to Tasmanians who play basketball. The investment of $21.5 million to invigorate the Elphin Sports Centre is highly anticipated and greatly welcomed. Over 4000 games of community basketball are played in Launceston each year. This redevelopment will ensure the sport is supported and continues to thrive. The redevelopment is not just a slam dunk. It is a full-court press for the future of our sport. My son gave me that line.

Through our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future, we are committed to supporting sport in our community. We want to see more people participating and connecting through sports. This is exactly what these projects will achieve.

As the Premier made clear during his stirring state of the state speech, Tasmanians, over many years, have developed a quiet determination to overcome challenges they face. Together, we have achieved much in the past 12 months: 4000 social and affordable homes, power bill subsidies, assistance to those affected by floods and storms, and to farmers impacted by drought. We have assisted rural communities, strengthened through the building of better connections, and improved access to mental health support. I am proud to be part of an accountable government progressing through our 2030 Strong Plan, which provides a framework to address a range of issues and concerns for Tasmanians. The provision of accurate updates on our programs and initiatives every 100 days demonstrates our commitment to support Tasmania and Tasmanians.

Maintaining a strong economy ensures our children stay and complete their education and secure jobs of choice in Tasmania. To deal with the cost of living, we need a strong economy. To invest in health, we need a strong economy. To build bridges, schools and hospitals, we need a strong economy. The Premier's comments ring true. We want to be calling out to the rest of the country and the world: if you want to start and grow a business, Tasmania is the best place in Australia. To ensure Tasmania continues to have a strong economy, we will continue to back business and enterprise. 

As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Mental Health and Wellbeing, I am pleased to see our commitment to enhancing and upgrading health facilities and the funding of programs to meet the health needs of Tasmanians. The redevelopments of each of our major public hospitals, including the expansion of emergency departments and upgrading of operating theatres, along with the progressing of plans for the Northern Heart Centre and the new mental health precinct in Launceston, will ensure the health needs of northern Tasmanians are met in contemporary spaces that will better meet the needs of the facility users. A recent visit to the Northside Mental Health Unit highlighted the significant benefits to patients that an alternative space will provide. Like the Premier, I wish to thank all the health staff who work so hard and achieve results every day.

Alongside these initiatives, the recruitment of new staff has begun for the mental health emergency co-response in northern Tasmania. This service will provide compassionate emergency care for people experiencing mental health distress in the community.

Late last year, a construction tender for the new multistorey car park at the LGH was released. When constructed, the car park will improve access for patients, staff and visitors. The project is a vital and really important part of our LGH master plan. We have also considered the impact of the construction works at the time for the users of the LGH. We will be establishing temporary car parking on the opposite corner of Charles Street and Howick Street for the duration of the construction period.

Employing 78 new full-time paramedics, the provision of incentives to attract GPs to our regional communities, the upgrading of the ambulance station at Legana, the recruitment of 12 paramedics to meet the demand in the West Tamar, and funding support to the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) to provide dental appointments to the more remote residents of our state will also reduce barriers to accessing healthcare. I recently spoke with a dental assistant who was part of the RFDS dental clinic, who was based at one of our rural primary schools for a week. The excitement that that visit to the dental van created was something that I perhaps do not share, but demonstrates the value of this service in meeting the dental health needs of those who have barriers accessing healthcare in more centralised locations.

The work done to address ramping at our hospitals and the increase in numbers of healthcare workers has ensured the faster movement of patients through emergency departments and a reduction in ramping. A problem was identified and we got on with fixing it. I commend the healthcare workers in these settings who ensure that each patient receives the individualised care and support that they need and deserve.

It has been a privilege to watch the development of the new Legana Primary School, from a paddock on the side of the highway to a magnificent facility designed to provide state-of-the-art learning spaces for the students and recreational facilities for the wider community. As patron of the Legana Cricket Club, I can assure you that the club members are really looking forward to being based on this outstanding sports field. It is a credit to the groundsman who created it.

In the coming year, I look forward to improvements in facilities at Mowbray Heights, Port Dalrymple, Ringarooma and South George Town schools. The increase in the sites for the successful Healthy School Lunch Program will see the benefits of the current program extended across the state. These benefits include an increase in school attendance, improved student behaviour both in and out of the classroom, and enhanced learning outcomes. I have spoken to a number of teachers in schools where this program is provided. They genuinely reiterate the value of the program and demonstrated improvement in students' knowledge, retention, and their willingness to actively engage in learning.

I recently made a small business visit to Bundaleera Vineyard in Relbia. They were recipients of small business grants. They have utilised the funds to upgrade data technology to enable them to more efficiently manage their online presence and booking platforms. Small grants are also making a difference to our local community.

It is important for us to ensure that the government businesses are delivering services to Tasmanians at the most sustainable cost while growing our economy. It is responsible to review what businesses the government should own. The assessment and review of these enterprises will assist with our informed decision-making around the disbursement or retention of them. Importantly, if a disbursement is determined, we will ensure that any change of ownership will have significant community service obligations built in.

I have seen firsthand Tasmanians overcoming the challenges that they face, working together and getting things done. As a government, we are doing the same. We will continue to persevere, and to work hard and fight hard, to ensure that our ambitious vision for this state is achieved.

[2.51 p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to provide my response to the state of the state address. In doing so, it is important that we acknowledge that, whilst at times we get caught up in localised debates and discussions, we do not operate in isolation from global events. We are seeing our major trading partners triggering a trade war. Tasmania is an export-orientated economy. Australia, being a very large island, is an export-orientated economy. We have trade deficits with most of our trading partners, particularly the European Union, most of Asia, and, clearly, North America. In this context, when one of the biggest economies in the world, the United States, triggers a trade war and the election of one person triggering a range of decisions, the discussions that we have in this place are not immune to that.

We need to be mindful that heading into the next months and years there is going to be a consequence for the Tasmanian community from that kind of debate. Markets are already becoming jittery and are factoring in a slowing of global economic growth because that is the impact of trade wars. They also have an artificial impact on inflation and, whilst the federal government has worked hard to bring down our inflation, if a global trade war escalates beyond what we are seeing in North America into the European Union, it will reach our shores at some stage. 

It is important, therefore, that we do not have a completely localised discussion about the State of Tasmania and the future of our state over the next 12 months or so. We are also seeing a significant escalation in gunboat diplomacy, wars and conflicts in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. When those things happen, when the major powers start to bump against each other, proxy wars pop up globally. That is the context within which we are providing the state of the state to the Tasmanian people. That is a statement of fact about some of the situations and circumstances we are heading into.

State of the state speeches are always interesting. There is a lot of grey in our world. It is never all bad; it is never all good. The government is saying it is all good. The opposition and others are saying it is all bad. There are elements of very good service delivery by the state government. There are elements of very poor delivery by the state government. There are areas where we are failing Tasmanians and there are areas where we are delivering good services. As a broad generalisation, we all need to commit to do better and there are elements of the government's work that need to be called to account, which is our role in this place.

When you look at the state of the state and public discourse, some of the key decisions that we are making today and in the coming months are driven by two things. One is that the state government's budget situation has significantly deteriorated. COVID put us back, but the actions and decisions of subsequent treasurers and governments have exacerbated our budget position so that it is now driving policy and the decisions that we are making. The other is the performance of our government business enterprises. By any measure, a large proportion of government business enterprises have had an abject failure of governance and have failed to do their job on behalf of Tasmanians.

Clearly, the paper that was released or the review that was called for late last year was off the back of the TT-Line and TasPorts disaster. Where we have ended up with that is an absolute disgrace. The three key players - the shareholder minister, and the boards and senior management of both TT-Line and TasPorts - spent a lot more time trying to construct circumstances where they were not going to get the blame, than taking responsibility and fixing the circumstances they were in. 

That extreme moment triggered the GBE review. I have had some real concerns about the actions of TasNetworks, Metro, and other GBEs over the last couple of years and questioned if they were making the best decisions for the Tasmanian community. Clearly, the intensity of the calamity that is the TT-Line-TasPorts circumstance triggered the GBE review. Both of those things have crossed over and created the two major drivers for public discourse and debate - not only in this House, but in lounge rooms and around kitchen tables throughout Tasmania.

Having been a minister when there was a Treasury view, supported by a treasurer and premier, that there needed to be significant reining in of expenditure, and having then gone through a couple of tough budget processes, I have some experience and can reflect on the consequences of blunt instruments being applied to a budget circumstance. Clearly, the circumstances the state was confronting then were significantly different from now. At the end of the term of my ministry, 2010 to 2014, there was no net debt; there was money in the bank. We are in a very different set of circumstances now. However, the lessons we learned from the blunt instruments that caused economic dislocation and a significant sapping of confidence in the Tasmanian public sector and economy should still be applied.

On one hand, the government is saying, 'We are not going to slash-and-burn'. However, two of the blunt instruments that Treasury recommended back then, which were taken up by the government - that is, efficiency dividends and vacancy control - are strategies now taken up by this government as well.

Efficiency dividends are a blunt instrument. It does demonstrate, at times, that the government is ambivalent as to what services should be cut and what programs could be trimmed. It is not good policy and they have been widely criticised. For example, I will quote Saul Eslake. He seems to be getting more airtime in this place than even some members, but I will quote Saul because he is an eminent, well-respected economist and we should listen to him. We do not always have to agree, but we should listen to him. When discussing efficiency dividends, he says they:

… are a poor substitute for conscious decisions as to what services should continue to be, or no longer continue to be, provided. … they frequently result in services continuing to be provided with inadequate levels of staffing, leading in turn to greater inefficiency and lower levels of customer or client
satisfaction. All too often, decisions as to which employees are terminated or which services are discontinued are taken by the lowest level of management capable of taking them - rather than as the outcome of any conscious, strategic, planning and decision-making process.

Regarding vacancy control, I will quote Mr Eslake again. It is a very poor strategy:

… for achieving expenditure savings. … Often the result is that the employees who leave are those most able to secure alternative employment - employees that an agency would prefer to retain if possible - whilst those remaining are more likely to be those less capable …

I do not necessarily agree with that, but in terms of the indiscriminate way a blunt vacancy control and a blunt efficiency dividend will respond to the needs and to service delivery - the essential services that state governments deliver - and we all know there are things in departments that definitely have to be done. There are things that are important to do, and we need to create a list of which to prioritise. However, we know there is a range of work being conducted that is nice to have, like, if you had money in the bank, 'Let's do this bit of work now because at some stage it will become valuable', or, 'Actually, this is something that we need to think about'.

I am not saying it is kite flying or it is hypotheticals, but we know there is an element of work that resources are applied to that are not essential for service delivery now, and maybe can be put on a to-do list once resources become available. Having secretaries, leaders and workers in the public sector provide input to that strategic decision, with an oversight of government, and making sure that the government priorities are being implemented, because the bureaucracy and public sector workers are very important in delivering the services and in providing advice to government. The nature of democracy is governments get elected, ministers get appointed, they have to make their decisions and stand and fall by those decisions. Having blunt instruments, you can say, 'Oh well, we have got vacancy control, we have got an efficiency dividend', but that is not a strategic way to respond to a challenging set of circumstances for the state Budget.

Those two elements have caused me great indigestion and concern in regard to the nature of the decisions that are being taken to respond to what cannot be described in any other way than a Budget headache. It is more than a headache. It is more than a migraine. It is a potentially fatal wound unless we deal with it. It is a significant issue that we need to respond to. Yes, you look at other states, there is debt as far as the eye can see in other states, but the Tasmanian economy and the Tasmanian revenue that we get for the public services that we provide and our ability to raise revenue is diminished by virtue of the nature of our economy and by virtue of our heavier reliance on GST receipts. Of all the states, we have less capacity to raise money outside of GST to pay down debt and to fund services.

I have said this before on record: blunt instruments, taking an axe to public services and withdrawing large sections of government activity in the private sector creates not only a crisis inside the public service in terms of the ability to deliver essential services, but it actually acts as a dead hand on the economy. It saps confidence out of the economy and a longer strategy to return to a surplus as a first and then draw and pay down debt to prepare for the future is important. I am not anti-debt. All governments can carry debt. The role of government is yes, have a sustainable set of books, but also deliver services. In Tasmania, we play a greater role in the economy.

The other push and pull is the issue of privatisation. It was a bombshell that was delivered by the Premier in his state of the state speech that was unexpected. Yes, the paper that was discussed before the review of government business enterprise did talk about ownership, but to go so far in the state of the state has address shocked people. As I intimated in my question to the Premier on Tuesday, there is a whole range of workers and people who rely on those GBEs for their livelihood, for their careers, who are now facing a very uncertain time, and this will not go away shortly. A review by Mr Eslake and the public and parliamentary debate that will follow will be significant and will have an impact on the economy by virtue of even saying those words.

I am an independent member, one of 35. I have said I will act in a constructive way. I will engage in the debate that has been discussed, but I say very clearly, I have not seen a privatisation of a monopoly government asset that has worked. I was talking to the media yesterday and gave the example of the rail network in Tasmania. ANL was sold. A New Zealand company came in, stripped the assets above and below rail. They did not do the maintenance. They did not do the work. Then, I think it was in 2007 or 2008, they essentially walked away from the asset and handed the keys back to the state government and the rail actually stopped running in Tasmania. Freight rail stopped running in Tasmania and guess what happened at that time? All of the heavy freight went on the roads. Guess what happened to the Midland Highway? Completely smashed. Not only did it cost us over half a billion dollars, pushing towards a billion dollars to get a functioning heavy freight and rail option back in Tasmania, we spent hundreds of millions of dollars fixing the roads.

The consequences of monopoly assets on essential services in an economy like Tasmania are great. When you look at the energy assets - I think the election of 1998 made it very clear - there are a number of acts which were brought into place to stop that from occurring. I am heavily sceptical. I am not in favour of privatising public monopoly assets. Predominantly, the global experience is that a private company comes in, there is a profit motive, they draw out the money, they do not do the work, it collapses, and government has to step back in to fix it. I am against that.

In my view we should not be having a conversation about privatising Metro. We should be having a conversation about bringing it in house and delivering it. Metro has shown that they are incapable of delivering a public transport service. Let us bring it back in. Private sector is not going to be buying it. It will just cost us more money, because we know Metro loses money each year. It is a public good. If you are worried about traffic congestion in our capital cities, get a functioning public transport system. That will help.

I am probably going to run out of time on this one, but there is a lot of talk about the stadium and the football team. I probably do not have enough time to really go into it. People say that we should just trash that. We do not have a choice in terms of the opportunity that is provided. It is not just about a football team. There are two things converging. For about 30 years the tourism industry has been calling out for an increased capacity in conventions and conferences. This stadium delivers that. We have also been desperate to get a football team, and after 30 years we have finally been able to get access to a licence. Those things do not happen just because we want them. They need to happen because you do a deal, you get it, you get an agreement and you deliver on the project. I have had people say to me, 'Geez, David, it is a lot of money for seven games'. I said it is not a football stadium, it is a stadium where we will play football. For example, people need to understand the nature of the conventions and conference economy. It will explode.

I get that people do not really appreciate and understand the economics of stadiums, but for example, a stadium deal for a football team is crucially important. Last year, Fremantle played St Kilda at the MCG. There were 23,000 people. That is a good crowd. Because of the stadium deal, St Kilda only earned about $100,000 or so. Geelong played Freo down in Geelong. It is their stadium. It is a clean stadium. 23,000 people or 20-odd thousand people, a similar crowd. They made $1 million. A stadium deal is crucially important for a team. Having a stadium that is so close to the CBD, where thousands of people can walk from all the multi-storey car parks, et cetera, is crucially important. If people think that you can have a team without a stadium, they kill the team. There is no argument to that. That is very clear.

There was a Gruen report. I am going to run out of time, sadly. I did provide a critique and I stand by that critique. There are elements - and I respect Mr Gruen - I have read a number of his papers. He clearly is a learned man. He is an economist. He is not an expert in sports, and he is not an expert in sport economy. He is an economist. It is very important.

For example, on pages 119 and 120 - and I do not understand his methodology. It is clearly just a question to him. In the Gruen report he discusses the impact of different discount rates on the benefit-cost ratio (BCR) for projects with large upfront capital costs. Under Infrastructure Australia, they get a lower discount rate. That was something that came from the New South Wales Treasury that was given to Infrastructure Australia. It is 4 per cent. When the 4 per cent is applied to the BCR for the stadium, it goes up to 60 cents on the dollar. With an optimistic figure it goes up to 75 cents on the dollar. The Bridgewater bridge has a BCR of 53 cents. Yes, you can save time, but the stadium will deliver millions of dollars to the Tasmanian economy year in, year out, for 30 to 40 years.

It talks a lot about Regatta Point, the Mac 2 project. I know we met with Mr Lennon, one of his first meetings, as if that is the answer. Here are the things that I want from the Mac 2 proposal: I want to see an Aboriginal heritage report, I want to see Aboriginal community consultation, an environmental report, federal handfish assessment, an economic analysis, urban planning, transport and pedestrian management, light pollution, noise and vibration, emergency management plans, any level of detailed designs, any level of roof detail, including height confirmation and detail on a retractable nature, social and cultural analysis, earthworks, cut-and-fill analysis, and investigation, remembering that 800,000 cubic metres of Jurassic dolerite fill will have to be excavated from underneath the regatta grounds and used as reclaimed land and fill, solid waste and hazard material, coastal inundation, heat risk. There are great images. Macquarie Point Development Corporation has delivered on all of these reports. It is a real project. I have run out of time.

Time expired.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.1_D=1.7_C=0.87] [3.11 p.m.]
Mr SHELTON (Lyons) - Deputy Speaker [Bookmark: Phr3_O=33.1_D=25.6_C=0.79] , it is an honour to represent the people of Lyons and stand here today as a member of the government to reply to the Premier's state of the state address that was delivered in this place on Tuesday afternoon. Before I go on, I will also continue some of the debate a little bit later on the stadium and talk about the potential of increasing the number of participants in Tasmania supporting regional  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=59.5_D=10.2_C=0.76] country football. We have to do that. We have to create a situation where we can get our kids off the screens, and so that they have an aspiration  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=70.0_D=5.8_C=0.84] to build on their physical fitness and play sport.

Before we get into that, the Premier  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=77.1_D=21.0_C=0.76] has announced a sweeping assault on the government's red tape and regulation, an audit of government programs to remove waste, and an assessment of the suitability of divesting a number of government-owned businesses. These are all measures that will benefit hardworking families and businesses across Lyons.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=98.9_D=14.4_C=0.82] Since being re-elected, the government has delivered more than 1000 initiatives in the first 300 days of its 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future. It is only just getting started; just warming up. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=114.8_D=10.2_C=0.88]  To give people the best possible opportunities to deal with the cost of living and to continue our record investment into health, we need a strong economy.  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=126.5_D=4.8_C=0.83] That is what is important for the people of my electorate.  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=132.5_D=5.4_C=0.75] To keep building roads, bridges, schools and hospitals, we need a strong economy. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=139.0_D=29.9_C=0.85]  To be able to implement the commission of inquiry's recommendation to keep our children safe we need to build on our economy and keep it growing. 

The Premier revealed new measures to identify cuts and cut unnecessary red tape and regulations, including taking a comprehensive look at all government programs. He also detailed the government's plan to achieve a sensible pathway to surplus without raising [Bookmark: Phr12_O=171.3_D=14.4_C=0.79]  taxes. This is cutting back business licensing by working with businesses to strip away unnecessary regulation to encourage growth in the small business sector while also ensuring people operate safely within the law.  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=187.6_D=23.6_C=0.77] Establishing a red tape portal where Tasmanians can log their experiences of unnecessary red tape is crucially important to cutting red tape.

Unnecessary legislation will be cut by setting aside parliamentary sitting days especially for removing the legislation, and requiring ministers and regulators to remove regulations for every new one that they create.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=212.4_D=5.2_C=0.75] We will audit government programs and state services resources to make sure  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=218.2_D=26.3_C=0.86] we are not wasting resources on things that are not a priority, enabling the government to structure more efficiently. We will assess the benefits of moving several entities of the government ownership, with respect to economist Saul Eslake to provide advice to the government on this. 

If I go back to my local government days, I will quote  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=245.4_D=2.6_C=0.72] an experienced GM of the day:

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=248.4_D=14.4_C=0.85] It is critically important for this place to understand that, of course, we don't have any money. All our money comes from the ratepayers and taxpayers of our community, so we have to be efficient [Bookmark: Phr18_O=263.1_D=4.4_C=0.88]  and responsible for that spend of money. 

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=269.9_D=0.9_C=0.81]  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=272.2_D=24.0_C=0.84] In listening to some of the debates that have come through this process, it has been very interesting. People have said we have to cut the infrastructure spend and so on. Yes, there needs to be a look at where the spend goes. In getting to where we are at the moment [Bookmark: Phr21_O=297.0_D=7.8_C=0.65] , Mr O'Byrne mentioned that the Midland Highway was the goat track that, over the last 10 or 11 years, had to be fixed. It was caused not just by extra traffic on the railway, but because there was no infrastructure spend, or very little, from around 2008 to 2014. Some of the backlog of infrastructure came from the schools around our communities that were built back in the 1950s and had not been upgraded for years. Education is critical and we needed to do that. We drive past the Bridgewater Bridge - well, I do when I come down here; not all of us do. It is a magnificent sight, to see the last section of the bridge going in. That great spend on the Bridgewater Bridge is a fantastic investment in the future of transport and logistics in Tasmania.

It is great to be able to report on the first 300 days. There are over 1000 achievements in the first 300 days of the 2020 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future. It has been successful in hitting the targets and benchmarks set out by the government. 

We have delivered, through the Renewable Energy Dividend, credits of $250 to households and $300 for small businesses to help the cost of living through energy rebates. Half-price bus fares were also introduced immediately in the new parliamentary term, meaning that travel on all operators - school buses, general access buses, ferries-  and all fare types were cheaper. This has been a saving for Tasmanians of thousands of dollars on transport and has increased the patronage on public transport.

Our government has begun the process of doubling the number of schools participating in the Healthy School Lunch Program to incorporate up to 60 schools in the program by 2026. The MyHome shared equity scheme has been enhanced to help more Tasmanians achieve the ultimate home ownership dream. So far, this has allowed 450 Tasmanians into their own home with a deposit of as little as 2 per cent. The Rockliff government has abolished stamp duty for Tasmanians buying their first homes up to a value of $750,000. This program will remain in place until 30 June 2026 and will save buyers up to $28,395. To date, 1700 people have been given this opportunity to save tens of thousands of dollars. That is a huge help to those wanting to enter the housing market for the first time.

We have committed $6 million to complete the new multipurpose base of the Royal Flying Doctor Service at Evandale, ensuring construction can get underway as soon as possible. Our government has given $1 million towards essential equipment for seven volunteer marine rescue services in Tasmania, including those in St Helens and Dodges Ferry in my electorate of Lyons.

We have stayed on track with our plan, investing in local economies and delivering more than 1000 initiatives in the first 300 days. Our next 100 days will see the delivery of a further 132 actions which will continue to make Tasmania the best place to live, work and raise a family. We will keep delivering on the things that matter for Tasmania. 

What has the last 300 days meant for the people of Lyons? In February this year, we saw the commencement of construction of the first purpose-built earthworks training site at Quercus Park. This partnership between the Civil Contractors Federation of Tasmania and Rural Youth Tasmania, delivered by the Rockliff government, will support the industry by upskilling workers to fill the skills shortage now and into the future. The site will see up to 3000 training qualifications per year delivered through faster, safer and more efficient training, resulting in more jobs in the already lucrative civil construction industry being filled by Tasmanian workers. 

Our government has a strong plan to back our agricultural sector with the commitment to fund Tasmania's first wool school, the shearing and wool-handling innovation centre at Campbell Town. Funding of $1.5 million will see the centre come to life, creating more opportunities for education and training in the wool industry, ensuring students no longer need to travel to the mainland to obtain the qualifications required to work in the agricultural industry. This centre will provide training to ease the skills shortage in the wool industry and will work with TasTAFE and other registered training organisations (RTOs) to leverage employment opportunities for their students. 

The Rockliff government has approved the construction of four new child and family centres, including a new super-sized centre at Longford. These centres will provide families with a range of early childhood services and supports for children aged zero to five years of age. Access to services such as psychologists, speech pathologists and social workers ensure children are meeting their development milestones as they near the beginning of their education in kindergarten. I can attest that the families of Longford are extremely excited about the opportunity and are looking forward to the construction of this centre.

Local sporting and community groups have benefited from grants funding, allowing upgrades and maintenance of their premises, and adding equipment and accessibility to members and visitors alike. Sporting clubs are quite often the heart and soul of communities and provide a safe haven for members, ensuring mental and physical health are maintained, social connections remain in place and relationships to the community can be instilled. 

The New Norfolk Golf Club is installing a new sprinkler system, freeing up the time of the dedicated volunteers who give generously of their time to perform the maintenance tasks of the club. The Diggers Cricket Club is now able to purchase more equipment and uniforms for their members, many of whom are from overseas backgrounds and are looking at ways to integrate further into the local community. The Blackstone Heights community is now able to construct more garden beds for its community to access fresh vegetables in exchange for garden maintenance and new friendships. The Mt Pleasant Football Club can now provide upgraded lighting to ensure year-round access for activities, enhancing the fitness of the community and, again, allowing social relationships to build.

All residents of Tasmania have benefited from the first 300 days of the Rockliff government in some form and we plan to continue to deliver.

It would be remiss of me not to mention the stadium and the economic benefits that will come from its construction. We have been given a wonderful opportunity to construct a world-class stadium to be the home of Tasmania's first AFL and AFLW teams. With the federal government contribution of $240 million and the state government's contribution of $375 million, we will have a first-class stadium that will provide economic benefits far into the future. With the AFL's input of $15 million and some private investment and borrowings, the Macquarie Point stadium will provide a plethora of jobs during the construction and upon completion. The stadium itself, having a 23,000-seat capacity, with forward planning to increase to 40,000, will provide more than 4000 jobs in construction. Once the precinct is completed, it will contain a 1500-seat capacity function room, catering facilities, back-of-house area and below-ground service areas, providing employment for up to hundreds of people.

Being a multipurpose stadium, there will be the capacity for out-of-season events such as concerts, festivals and the ability to host cricket matches, along with the events within the function centre itself. The potential for expansion into retail hospitality spaces is widely supported by the community, adding further economic benefits to the state. With the addition of the high-performance training centre and the construction of the stadium and its flow-on economic benefits, it can only be seen as a good thing.

When it comes to the stadium - and I need to declare an interest in this because I am the patron of the Oatlands District Football Association and a life member of my local Bracknell Football Club, for regional football - what everybody has to understand is this is not just about the stadium, it is about the team and what that does for the community.

We know that, during the winter, footy teams are the lifeblood of regional communities. They are what supports the community and what brings them together, which gives them satisfaction and it gives them mateship. What I have seen over my lifetime is the demise of too many local footy teams. We have to reinvigorate AFL among our schools. If I have a message for the AFL and the Tassie Devils and Brendon Gale, the CEO, it is that we have to get out among our schools. These heroes of the game need to be amongst our community. They need to have a kick, end to end with our school kids and inspire them to want to be good AFL players. If they do not become an AFL player, that is not a problem, as long as they are outside kicking a football, because we have a real problem sneaking up on us: that is our kids on devices and not outside exercising. The team is critical to invigorate that. 

The member up here before me mentioned the Gruen report. What I could not see in the Gruen report is where the advertising of Tasmania through the Tasmania Devils on our main TV screens, either of a Thursday night, a Friday night or whenever the game is televised, that advertising of Tasmania and the benefit of that; two hours of football on TV, talking about Tasmania, having the view over the Derwent. We know what has happened with the basketball side and the JackJumpers and how that has invigorated young people into sport and how that has invigorated the Tasmanian name. We need that salesmanship and that exposure to the mainland, which is, of course, our main tourism market.

It is more than that though. The Tasmanian team, through the benefit of having the $330 million over the period of the contract into the team, when the team is up and running, will be worth somewhere between $45 to 50 million a year. That is what it takes to run an AFL team. It is made up of the AFL sponsorship, of course, it is made up of the Tasmanian sponsorship, it will be made up of private sponsorships and it is made up of memberships. Just imagine another $50 million business in Tasmania. That is a $50 million business that does not exist now that will, once the team starts playing and once we get up and running. It is absolutely vital. It has its benefits in regional football, it has its benefits in the youth of Tasmania, and it has its economic benefits through the team when it is operational and spending those wages. There will be doctors and physios and trainers, the plethora of people who are employed around an AFL team; they will be out in our community spending their wages and advancing our community.

It is a multi-use stadium. There will be concerts, there will be other sporting activities in that venue, such as soccer or a rugby side coming down here. It is not just a footy stadium; it is a stadium for the whole plethora of uses that you can use the stadium for. It is an economic driver and, as I have said in this place before, which I have not got a chance to say now - 

Time expired.

[3.31 p.m.]
Ms BROWN (Franklin) - Deputy Speaker, I am disappointed it is you in the Chair and not the honourable Speaker so I could wish her a happy birthday on the record. I will have to wish for her to be in the Chamber with me to do so.

I will start by extending my congratulations to Casey Farrell on his election as the new member for Lyons. I know Casey will bring a fresh energy, dedication and strong voice for the people of Lyons to this place, and his contributions to the parliament and to Tasmania.

I also offer my heartfelt gratitude to Rebecca White for her years of dedication and leadership. Her commitment to our state has been unwavering. She leaves behind a legacy of standing up for Tasmanians and fighting for fairness, opportunity and progress. Though she has moved on to the national stage of Canberra, I have no doubt Rebecca will continue her strong advocacy for our state and for our people.

It is a privilege to stand here today to respond to the state of the state address. It is my first time doing so as an elected representative. I do so with a deep sense of responsibility to speak up for Tasmania, hold this government accountable and present a vision for a better, fairer and stronger Tasmania. 

We saw a stark difference between the Premier's speech and the speech delivered by our leader, Dean Winter. While the Premier's address was devoid of any real substance, offering nothing more than the tired, uninspired rhetoric that Tasmanians have come to expect from this government, Dean Winter provided a bold, hopeful and ambitious vision for Tasmania's future. He spoke of opportunity, fairness and a genuine commitment to the people who make this state what it is.

The Premier's speech, on the other hand, can be summed up in three devastating truths. One: this minority government is drowning in a debt of its own making. Two: they have no real plan, no coherent vision to move forward, and no sense of responsibility or accountability. Three: in their desperation, they are now turning to privatisation, selling off Tasmania's assets to cover up for their failures. Privatisation is not a plan for the future; it is a last-ditch attempt to fix the financial mess they have created at the expense of every single Tasmanian.

Let us talk about the cost of privatisation and what that really means for the people of Tasmania. The Premier might try to dress it up as a responsible financial decision, but Tasmanians know the truth. We have seen it before. We know exactly what happens when essential public services are sold to private companies. Power bills go up because private companies exist to make a profit, not to serve the public good. Car regos - guess what? They go up too. The cost of living rises because the essential services people rely on, from public transport to insurance, become more expensive when they are run for a profit rather than public interest. Jobs are lost in the name of efficiency and service quality declines because the bottom line becomes more important than the people who rely on those services.

TasNetworks, MAIB, Metro Tasmania, the Land Titles Office and the Public Trustee - these are all on the chopping block under this government's reckless privatisation plan. Only this morning, we heard from the Premier that he will not even rule out selling the TT-Line.

Let us be absolutely clear: these are not just assets. These are vital public services that belong to the people of Tasmania. They are built with public money, they serve the public need and they must remain in public hands.

One of the most devastating consequences of privatisation will be the impact on power bills. TasNetworks is currently a publicly owned company that delivers electricity to our homes and businesses across the state. If the government sells it, what happens next? We only need to look to the mainland to see the answer. When electricity networks were privatised in other states, prices skyrocketed. In Victoria power prices have more than doubled since the network was sold. In New South Wales electricity prices have surged, hurting families and businesses alike. Tasmanians are already struggling under the cost of living. Selling TasNetworks will only make things worse. It will mean higher bills for households, greater pressure on small businesses and increased financial stress for our families already doing it tough.

Then there is Metro Tasmania, the backbone of our public transport system. For years we have seen this government neglect Metro, running it into the ground so they can justify selling it. We have heard all the promises before: promises for better services, safer working conditions for our drivers, improved reliability, but what have we actually seen? Transit officers promised in 2023 are still missing in action. Security screens for drivers are not installed. We see drivers every day risking their lives - sometimes copping abuse every day because they have not installed the security screens.

Fifty bus shifts were left unfulfilled in a single day just this week, leaving passengers stranded and workers stretched beyond breaking point. This government's neglect is not just an inconvenience, it is a deliberate strategy. They want Metro to fail so they can justify privatisation. If they succeed, what happens next? Fares will rise, routes will be cut, and regional communities will be left without reliable transport options. This is what privatisation looks like in the real world. It is not about efficiencies or better services; it is about making money for private investors at the expense of the public.

Privatisation does not just hurt households; it hurts the entire state. It drives up costs, it forces businesses to pay more for essential services, and it makes Tasmania less competitive. It sends profits out to other states rather than reinvesting them here. Selling Tasmanians' assets means selling the future. It means short-term gain for long-term pain.

Let us not forget the jobs that will be lost. When public services are privatised, workers are always the first to suffer. Wages are cut, conditions are stripped back, and secure jobs are replaced with insecure contracts. This government has already announced a public sector hiring freeze, making it harder for young Tasmanians to find jobs at home. Now they want to privatise essential services, putting more jobs at risk.

Tasmania deserves better. Labor believes in keeping jobs and essential services in public hands. We believe in protecting jobs, keeping power bills low, and ensuring that public services serve the people, not private profits. Unlike this government, we have a vision for Tasmania's future - a vision built on investment, opportunity and fairness.

We will fight to keep TasNetworks, Metro, MAIB, the Land Titles Office and the Public Trustee in public hands. We will work to lower power bills, not increase them through privatisation. We will fight for secure, well-paid jobs in Tasmania. We will always put Tasmanians first.  Tasmanians deserve a government that works for them, not a government that is willing to sell them out.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=10.0_D=20.5_C=0.84] Privatisation is not the answer. It is a betrayal of everything that makes this state great. We will fight every single step of the way. It is time for real leadership. It is time for a government that puts Tasmanians first. It is time for a Labor government. 

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=45.4_D=6.9_C=0.78] [3.41 p.m.]
Mrs PENTLAND (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I thank every member who has contributed with their replies to the Premier's state of the state address.  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=53.3_D=11.6_C=0.86] It is clear that our state is at an important juncture with some big looming challenges. I also plan on addressing some of those, but I really want to start on a positive note.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=66.3_D=6.2_C=0.84] Like many others in this House, I have attended a lot of events and had thousands of conversations over the past few months [Bookmark: Phr7_O=73.6_D=2.8_C=0.79] . More often than not, I am left with a sense of optimism.  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=78.2_D=11.4_C=0.69] Whether it be innovative businesses competing with the best in the world, or homegrown tourism ventures providing visitors with unforgettable experiences, you do not have to look far to be inspired. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=91.0_D=5.4_C=0.88]  It could be the fearless advocates demanding some of the state's most vulnerable people get a better deal.  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=98.2_D=13.0_C=0.77] I am not saying that there is not injustice in our communities, but each and every city and town in Tasmania is full of brilliant, compassionate people determined to improve the lives of others. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=112.5_D=9.5_C=0.89]  There is a lot of work to be done to make sure we live in a more equitable society where everyone has access to the basic services a rich country like ours should provide.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=123.2_D=20.0_C=0.82] In 2025, my focus will be on ensuring better health pathways, strengthening our midwifery sector, addressing our state's housing crisis, and improving education around domestic and family violence. My views have been shaped by my own experiences and the countless Tasmanians who have shared their stories with me.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=144.6_D=24.0_C=0.86] I am reluctant to talk too much about my own personal experience, and I thank everyone who has reached out to me following the loss of Emmett, but I do need to mention the amazing people who were there for me during my time of grief. Tasmanian midwives play such a critical role in our hospital system. They provide not only medical care but also emotional support in some of life's most vulnerable moments.  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=169.5_D=4.4_C=0.80] Their dedication is extraordinary. However, dedication alone is not enough.  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=174.8_D=11.7_C=0.84] We need real investment, adequate staffing levels, better workplace conditions and comprehensive resources to ensure every Tasmanian mother and baby receives the care they deserve.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=187.7_D=8.2_C=0.88] I must say the care I received was an incredibly high standard, but I understand not every Tasmanian family has the same experience. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=196.7_D=16.7_C=0.81]  The recent independent review into maternity services at the Royal Hobart Hospital exposed severe shortcomings: chronic understaffing, lack of leadership, and a culture that discourages reporting critical incidents. These systemic failures put lives at risk.  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=214.4_D=4.5_C=0.90] I refuse to accept that this is the best we can do. We must do better.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=220.3_D=26.0_C=0.88] We must also address the regional disparities in maternity care. Women in rural and remote areas deserve the same high standard of care that those in urban centres receive. No Tasmanian mother should have to travel hours to access vital maternity services. No family should feel abandoned during the most critical time in their lives. Investing in regional midwifery services is not optional. It is a necessity.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=247.6_D=3.6_C=0.48] UTAS does not currently offer midwifery education in Tasmania.  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=251.7_D=17.4_C=0.76] When they withdrew in 2017, students were left with no choice but to enrol with the University of Southern Queensland, studying online and securing their own practical placements in Tasmanian hospitals. Initially, they even had to travel to Queensland for residential intensives. [Bookmark: Phr22_O=269.9_D=13.8_C=0.76]  Other options for study include Charles Sturt University, which requires travel to Wagga Wagga, and Charles Darwin University's direct entry midwifery program, where students travel to Darwin, but complete their clinical placements here.

 [Bookmark: Phr23_O=285.1_D=19.9_C=0.69] UTAS now has a state-of-the-art facility, The Shed in Launceston with a world-class nursing education department. I have toured it myself and it is impressive. Given this incredible resource, why are we not we offering hands-on midwifery education in Tasmania? For those who experience loss, compassionate support can make all the difference. That is why I am proud to champion organisations like Beyond the Rainbow and Heartfelt Australia. Beyond the Rainbow, founded by Colette Butler, who lost her daughter Amelia at 38 weeks, provided care boxes and sibling packs to every maternity and neonatal unit in Tasmania. Since early 2024, they have donated 200 care boxes and 58 sibling packs, small but profoundly meaningful gestures that remind grieving parents that they are not alone. I know firsthand the comfort these services provide. I will fight to ensure that their invaluable work continues.

Heartfelt Australia is a volunteer organisation of professional photographers who gift bereaved families photographic memories of their precious children. Their work is done with immense compassion and sensitivity, giving families something priceless in their time of loss. These unsung heroes deserve recognition, support, and funding to continue their extraordinary service to the community.

We must do more. Bereavement leave policies need to be strengthened to ensure parents who suffer pregnancy loss are given the time and support they need to grieve. No one should have to return to work immediately. As legislators, we have the power to ensure that grieving parents are treated with the dignity and compassion they deserve.

The lack of affordable housing is one of the most urgent crises facing Tasmania today. This is not just a statistic, it is a humanitarian crisis. Behind every number is a family struggling to find a home, a single parent forced to sleep on a friend's couch, a pensioner living in fear of rent hikes and eviction. The sad reality is that new home construction is plummeting. Over the 2023-24 period, new home starts declined by an alarming 23.3 per cent. Higher density developments, crucial components of any sustainable housing strategy, fell by 56.1 per cent. This is catastrophic failure to meet demand.

Thirty years ago Tasmania built 5000 new high-density homes over five years. In the last five years we have managed only 1500. We are falling behind. The answer lies in red tape, outdated regulations and a lack of political will. We must act now. We need policies that stimulate new housing developments, reduce bureaucratic delays and ensure social and affordable housing projects are prioritised. Without bold action, this crisis will continue to deepen, leaving more Tasmanians without a place to call home.

I moved a motion in this House for better consultation from the government to the industry and stakeholders with regard to the Residential Tenancy Amendment Bill in 2024. If this bill is not balanced, rentals will be sold or places will go to the short-term market. We cannot afford that. We must also ensure that renters are protected. Rent increases must be fair, eviction protections must be strengthened and rental standards must be enforced to ensure that every Tasmanian has a safe and secure place to live.

We cannot talk about the wellbeing of Tasmanians without addressing domestic and family violence. This is not only a private issue, it is a collective crisis. One in three Australian women have experienced physical violence since the age of 15. These are not only numbers. They are our mothers, our daughters, sisters and friends.

Education is one of the most powerful tools in preventing domestic and family violence. We need to ensure that Tasmanians, particularly young people, are equipped with the knowledge to recognise warning signs, understand their rights and seek help when needed. We must integrate domestic violence awareness into our school curriculums, provide better training for frontline workers, and ensure our legal system prioritises safety of survivors over bureaucratic loopholes. Prevention starts with education. I will tirelessly advocate for stronger, more proactive measures to combat this horrific issue.

Funding the frontline service must also be a priority. Crisis accommodation, counselling services, and legal support for survivors must be adequately resourced. No survivors should be turned away due to lack of funding.

As we begin the parliamentary year, three of the issues that dominated 2024 continue to loom large. The health of the state's budget is starting to sink in for many Tasmanians. They are aware of the debt and, more importantly, they are aware of the cost of servicing that debt. They know growing interest repayments will prevent us from investing in new projects. Saul Eslake's budget is full of constructive ideas to both save and generate more money but, unfortunately, they have been largely dismissed by the government. Instead, the Treasurer has proposed a hiring freeze. While I applaud him for looking at ways to create efficiencies, I know that Mr Eslake has described the freeze as a relatively crude measure and is reliant to some extent on arbitrary definitions of who is an essential worker and who is not. I urge the Treasurer to be more transparent about what roles are being targeted and provide regular updates on how positions are not being filled or readvertised. I remain quietly sceptical on how much downward pressure the freeze will put on the budget.

Return on investments is at the core of the debate about selling government-owned businesses. The government initially set out to reform GBEs, including the proposed merger of TT-Line, TasPorts, and TasRail. Now, the conversation has shifted to asset sales. I remain open-minded and will allow the government to make its case. However, it is clear that Tasmanians are instinctively opposed to privatisation. They say to not read the comments, but sometimes there are too many to ignore. Voters are sceptical about the Premier's justification for exploring potential sales. The government must prove that any short-term financial gain will outweigh long-term dividends. It must guarantee that service delivery will not be diminished and it must ensure that any sale does not come at the expense of local workers. Privatisation must serve the interests of future governments, not just the current one. I am not fundamentally opposed to privatisation, but it has to stack up.

It is not only Eslake's report that I would dearly love the state government to pay more attention to. Dr Nicholas Gruen's report on the Macquarie Point Stadium should also be taken seriously. It rightly highlights the imbalance in the agreement struck between the AFL and the amount of risk being taken out by the Tasmanian taxpayer. We did not expect the government to read the Gruen report and abandon its plans, but to completely dismiss it was extremely disappointing.

Despite the popularity of the Devils and a massive uptake in the inaugural membership, polling shows that Tasmanians are far from convinced by the Mac Point plan. Only 36 per cent of people polled indicated their support for the project, compared to 59 per cent against. In my electorate of Bass, it was 64 per cent. It shows the government has failed to convince Tasmanians about the merits of this project. I am sure the cost is a big factor in people's minds, but I also think it reveals a disconnect with the way the project was imposed upon Tasmanians. The AFL's ultimatum that there will be no team without a new taxpayer-funded stadium sits incredibly uneasily with a lot of people I speak to. For many, it is putting the cart before the horse. Why not demonstrate a clear need for new infrastructure first and take the public with you, clearly explaining the potential benefits?

With both major parties now supporting the stadium, I believe the crossbench has an important role to play in making sure the voices of many are heard. It is not about being negative, it is about making sure the government is as transparent as possible and that the concerns held by those 59 per cent are acknowledged. Let me be clear: I am 100 per cent supportive of Tasmania getting its own team in the AFL and the AFLW. It would be an enormous boost for the state's sport-loving culture and send a powerful message to young Tasmanians that their dreams are in reach, in particular to young women who have been sidelined in this state for way too long. I do understand Brendon Gale when he talks about guaranteeing the club is commercially viable, but none of that means the views of the public should be disregarded or that a report like one produced by Dr Nicholas Gruen should be completely ignored.

In June last year I asked the Premier how his government would respond to the Gruen report. He assured this House that his government would take it seriously, absorb any information it provided on stadium infrastructure, and provide a fulsome statement on such matters. It is clear the government has not taken this report seriously. The Gruen report was an opportunity for the government to negotiate a better and fairer deal for Tasmania. It is disappointing that they chose not to.

Given the speculation that the stadium will not be completed until at least 2030, I would again urge the Premier to sit back down with the AFL to discuss the terms of the agreement. As it stands, Tasmanian taxpayers are shouldering all the risk and the last thing we need is to have to pay fines for missing construction deadlines. If the stadium is going to be delayed, I hope the AFL and the government will be crystal clear about what that means for the team. Tasmanian businesses will be making investment based on when and where the team will play. Is the AFL willing to have a Tasmanian team play out of the two existing venues for one, two, or even three years? The league will say it does not want to engage in hypotheticals, but those hypotheticals will soon become very real indeed.

My reservations about the stadium investment and the way it has been handled are no reflection at all on the newly established club and the amazing people running it. Kath McCann has done an incredible job engaging with footy lovers and clubs in every pocket of the state. Thanks to that hard work, I am confident the teams will attract enormous support wherever they run out.

The challenges before us are significant, but so too is our capacity to create change. We cannot afford complacency. We must listen to those affected, work collaboratively across sectors, and implement policies that create a lasting, meaningful impact. Let us move beyond the rhetoric and deliver tangible outcomes. Let us work together to make our beautiful state fairer, stronger, and more compassionate.

Ms HOWLETT (Lyons - Minister for Hospitality and Small Business) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak on the 2025 state of the state speech given by the Premier earlier this week. It focused on the delivery of our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future. Importantly, the state of the state speech delivers on the government's 2024 election commitments.

In his speech, the Premier highlighted the goal to make Tasmania the best place in the country for anyone to run a small business. To make certain Tasmania continues to have a strong economy, we must back business and enterprise, including cutting red tape and ensuring every cent we invest is value for money. The TCCI, one of Tasmania's peak bodies for business, said this is without doubt the most ambitious, reform-orientated state of the state speech in over 20 years and it supports what the Premier, Mr Rockliff, outlined.

As Minister for Hospitality and Small Business, I am committed to working closely with our key industry stakeholders and the wonderful hospitality and small business community. I have done so in my first months in this portfolio, just as I have always done within my electorate and across my portfolios of Primary Industries, Water, and Racing. Deputy Speaker, small businesses can rely on this Liberal government because we have a strong plan to support their future. We are listening, as we have always done, to stakeholders, hospitality venues, and small business owners, and making practical changes to reduce the burden of unnecessary red tape. The state of the state speech features several key commitments reflecting the aspirations of this sector, which makes up 97 per cent of all businesses in Tasmania. As minister for Small Business, I am proud to call on innovators and entrepreneurs from across the rest of the country and around the world, telling them that if they want to start and grow a business, Tasmania is the best place in Australia to do so. That is not something new. It is a recommitment to all Tasmanians.

With plenty of small business experience among this member's side of the Chamber, we are firm in backing our businesses to the hilt. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.8_D=15.3_C=0.67]  I know firsthand the challenges that unnecessary and time-consuming red tape and regulation can put on those  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=41.5_D=4.5_C=0.86] employing Tasmanians and contributing to the Tasmanian economy.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=46.8_D=16.8_C=0.81] My first foray into business was a startup out of my garage when I was 20 years old in Brighton. I took a risk. I started up a distribution company. I was a salesperson during the day and I packed stock out of my garage of a night. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=64.6_D=27.0_C=0.73]  As a Minister for Small Business, I will always take up and fight for this very important sector of the Tasmanian economy. I have always understood that small business is the engine room to our economy. From little things, big things grow. I am passionate about small business because that is where I come from. I know what it is like to pay others before I pay myself [Bookmark: Phr6_O=92.4_D=1.9_C=0.79] : the late nights, the uncertainty, but also the  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=95.1_D=6.6_C=0.79] entrepreneurial spirit that we need to nurture in so many.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=102.9_D=4.0_C=0.77] Labor has never been a friend of small business.  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=108.8_D=27.6_C=0.82] Small business is the engine room of our economy. The small businesses are taken for granted by those on the opposite side of this Chamber. In a true show of colours, the shadow treasurer came out publicly on 7 February this year and confirmed what we have known all along: Dean Winter's Labor is no friend of small business. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=136.9_D=2.8_C=0.58]  Mr Willie slammed our government's investment  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=140.1_D=7.6_C=0.84] and support for our small business through the popular Enabling Business Grant Program as 'reckless spending'.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=148.6_D=24.8_C=0.83] You know what else he said? He said, 'It is a nice idea'. Can you believe it? Can you imagine criticising nearly 43,000 businesses across our state that make such an important contribution to our economy, not only in dollar terms but a social economy as well. That is typical Labor.  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=174.3_D=6.1_C=0.76] All we hear from the other side is negative, negative, negative, talking our state down.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=181.7_D=29.3_C=0.85] The Premier detailed how the government will focus on removing unnecessary legislation and will task ministers to remove regulations in place of the ones that they create. That is exactly what we did with our landmark racing reform. This new legislation, which came into effect on 1 February this year, provides the Tasmanian racing industry with a modern, fit-for-purpose legislation for regulation and integrity. At the same time we repealed the old, outdated, no longer fit-for-purpose legislation and abolished the old regulator that had been holding back the industry. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=211.4_D=26.0_C=0.84]  We will also be setting aside parliamentary sitting days especially for removing legislation. By doing so, we will reduce the burden of state administration on ordinary Tasmanians.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=238.2_D=3.1_C=0.86] We also need our State Service to be the right size.  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=241.6_D=19.8_C=0.82] We can improve productivity and get better services without additional spending. In addition, we will also be undertaking a comprehensive audit of all government programs across the board to make sure we are using resources on things that are a priority, and to avoid duplication in any way.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=262.4_D=28.3_C=0.83] As Minister for Primary Industries, we have been finding the red tape and slashing it over time. Farmers have come to us. They have faced challenges, most of them out of their control. It is imperative that we provide a positive business environment for them to operate in. This government has previously streamlined property protection permits to help farmers manage the challenges they face to grow crops and grow feed for their animals.  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=291.4_D=7.8_C=0.77] We have streamlined the permit process for their production of hemp and poppy crops to help industries and farmers get on with the job of producing the products that people need.

We have also invested in research and extension tools and communication initiatives to help farmers improve and grow their production systems. Ensuring our farmers have the right information and technology readily available is part of our strategy to make it easier for farmers to do business.

The Premier has outlined areas where the government can improve. When it comes to the number of business licences required for small businesses in this state, we can do better. It takes up to 37 licences to open a cafe and 26 licences to open a retail shop. That is far too many by anyone's estimation. I welcome this initiative from the Premier. I will work closely with the department to ensure that this occurs on top of what we have already done in this space.

We need to reduce not only the number of licences but also the timeframe for approvals, which many stakeholders have told me is unacceptable and allows uncertainty to creep in. When people have stepped up and risked their livelihoods and hard-earned money to establish a business, uncertainty is the last thing that they need. This government is about supporting businesses.

We will continue to support rural people juggling their businesses and families, like Rachel and Jimmy from Oatlands running their cafe, or Annette and her family in Bellerive, who only want to get on with doing what they do best without long turnaround times and unnecessary paperwork. As a Liberal government, we want to support and champion these people, not have them tied down in regulation and paperwork.

Last year, we announced the introduction of public service standard timeframes for most permits and approvals issued by state government agencies to Tasmanian businesses. This is about providing businesses with a clear understanding of how long a permit or approval from a state government agency should reasonably take.

I have met with many small businesses in recent weeks and months who have reached out to me regarding issues with liquor licence permit delays and other red tape issues. I have been pleased to have been able to work with key stakeholders like the Tasmanian Hospitality Association (THA) and the red tape reduction small business advocate from the office of the Coordinator-General to quickly provide assistance to these business owners. Some of these businesses have faced lengthy waiting times for liquor permits and do not have the time or resources to continually chase these matters up.

We need to look at how we can make doing business easier in this regard, which we are doing. That is exactly what we have been doing since 2014. We are getting on with the job at hand, working with industry, listening to their concerns, facilitating discussions between peak bodies and stakeholders, and working collaboratively to reduce these barriers. We will continue to engage with key stakeholders such as the Tasmanian Hospitality Association, the TCCI, the Tasmanian Small Business Council, government departments, and other ministerial offices to work on better long-term solutions for these issues.

By continuing to work on reducing red tape with simple and practical solutions, this government is letting small business owners get on with what they do best - building their dreams. The current national economic conditions are having an impact on many businesses and contributing to business stress across Australia and Tasmania. Higher interest rates, cost-of-living pressures and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) pursuing depths that were previously put on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic are hurting business confidence. Small business is important to our economy and in particular the hospitality businesses that form a big part of our local communities and our visitor economy. As Minister for Small Business, I will keep working hard to make Tasmania the best place in Australia to do business.

When it comes to our government businesses, as the Premier outlined this week we have embarked on the largest shake up of GBE and state-owned corporations ever undertaken in this state. In this first session of parliament we will be progressing the first set of changes to ensure government businesses better deliver services to Tasmania. Importantly, we will work through this carefully and methodically so that it is achieved at the lowest sustainable cost, while we are also growing our economy and engaging with businesses and community in a constructive manner. As the Premier said, if certain GBEs can provide a better outcome for Tasmania under an alternative ownership arrangement, this will be carefully considered. There will be safeguards and guarantees, included any change of ownership because this is about improving service delivery. We will look to invest the proceeds of any change in ownership in a sensible 'pathway to surplus' future fund. 

In addition, the government will soon be relaunching the revised charter for working on private land for our GBEs. As we said in our 2030 strong plan, this government is updating the charter to ensure that on-farm interactions are respectful and informed, as they should be. Government businesses access farms to make their regulatory obligations such as routine maintenance and meter reading as well as to undertake planning and construction of projects. Farms are workplaces as well as homes. Farmers have the right to expect to be treated respectfully. As the minister for Primary Industries and Water, I also expect that farmers are treated with respect by businesses that need to access their farm.

The Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania (NRE Tas) and other businesses including TasWater, TasNetworks, Tasmanian Irrigation and Aurora Energy, are updating their charter. This work is progressing well and I look forward to relaunching the revised charter shortly. As I have said, in order for Tasmania to continue to have a strong economy, we must support our business and enterprises and that is what we are doing. We are getting on with the job.

[4.12 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, as one of the newest batch of MPs, this is my first firsthand experience of a state of the state address. What an inauspicious moment it turned out to be. The address stands out as a low point in my time in parliament to date. What a disappointing speech by the Premier. This was an opportunity to talk up the people of Tasmania, to acknowledge and thank the committed staff who work in the public service; to honestly evaluate those things that are going well in our state and take a clear-eyed look at those things that are not going well; to speak of the value of our wild places and commit to protecting them; to share a vision of the future that is kind, inclusive and hopeful.

Instead, we got a speech that was dull, vacuous and totally underwhelming. It was a speech that was one big love-in on business and high-vis. I do not have a problem with business or high-vis. I am married to someone who operates their own business and has rocked high-vis every day for the last 25 years, but the unrestrained embrace of business in the Premier's state of the state address was unsavoury and imbalanced. It misses the mark as the government dumped Tasmanians to fall upon the neck of business interests and big corporates. We know where the government is getting its ideas. It does not take much to connect the dots between the lurch to the far right in the US and the government's ridiculous brainwaves that cutting public service jobs, giving in to the too-often self-interested demands of business and selling off precious Tasmanian assets might be a good thing. It is straight out of the Trump-Musk playbook.

I have to ask who the government is here for. Who is it the Liberal government has in mind when figuring out is policies. It should be the people of Tasmania, but scrape away the veneer of faux care that they weave into their speeches and listen closely to the words the Premier spoke, and it is business, profit. More business and more profit is what the government really cares about. The lived experience of Tasmanians falls far down the list of government priorities.

There is another giveaway about the government's priorities, that is a very obvious silence in the Premier's address. I am not talking about actual silence, I am talking about what the Premier did not say. He may have filled a very short 25 minutes with one buzzword after another, but what the Premier did not say speaks volumes. Looking back over the Hansard, there are three short paragraphs in the Premier's address that provide the briefest of overviews of a few cherry-picked improvements the government can lay claim to, as if by sliding quickly across the surface of state happenings, Tasmanians will not notice the government's glaring failures. Well, I have spent the summer hearing from people in Bass, and Tasmanians most definitely are noticing the government's glaring failures. My office has received e-mail after message after phone call from people who do not know where else to turn when their needs are not met by services. I have heard story after story about people waiting and waiting for essential healthcare, gastroscopies, knee replacements, cardiac interventions, or outpatient appointments.

The Premier boasts that ambulance ramping times have been cut. The quiet bit he does not say is that Tasmanians are still waiting longer for ambulances to arrive, they are sitting in emergency departments for longer, they are waiting longer for essential surgery and every one of those indicators has gone backwards in the last 12 months. Sure, the government can celebrate the success of reduced ramping times but it also needs to be honest about the things that are not going well.

Tasmanians deserve a true and complete evaluation of where we are at, which brings me to the Premier's claims around employing 2300 new healthcare workers. While it may be true that there are 2300 new workers in our health system, unions continue to highlight the huge numbers of vacancies across health, including 390 unfilled nursing positions at the Royal Hobart Hospital alone. As the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation say in their ongoing campaign, 'Safe hospitals save lives'. The government needs to find solutions that ensure every shift has the number of staff required. That is what makes the government's newly-announced hiring freeze so appalling. The health service is already struggling under the weight of staffing vacancies. So is the child safety service and now this government wants to erase those vacancies by erasing the positions. When staff who are essential to these services leave, the government just wants to stop replacing them. While the government refused to define essential and non-essential staff or 'frontline' and 'backend' staff, one has to assume that every single role or position is being considered as a potential job that can be cut. This is an outrageous betrayal of public service workers and Tasmanians.

I want to speak here about something we would all rather forget. The government talks about COVID as if it is in the past and we all want to believe that and in some ways it is. We will not go back to lockdowns and the economic support that went along with those lockdowns, but COVID is still here. People are still catching it, developing long-COVID and experiencing debilitating long-term effects including a whole range of chronic diseases. I have been hearing from people going through this right now and the risk of those long-term effects increases with every repeat infection a person experiences. COVID is still having an impact and the government would do well to pay attention to this. There is a need to continue measuring infection rates. There is a need to keep up with the research on COVID sequelae and to monitor how many Tasmanians are experiencing this. The government needs to educate Tasmanians about the ongoing risk of COVID and how the risk of an infection can be reduced, as well as following the lead of other states and working towards clean air standards in Tasmania.

Looking beyond the health system, the state of children and youth services within Tasmania is also notable. Here we have another service we know is under immense pressure. While some progress has been made on recruitment, there are significant staff vacancies across the state. In addition, there are many staff on long-term personal leave or workers compensation, further exacerbating the situation and leaving unsafe gaps in the service. Too many children do not have an allocated case manager and significant numbers of children are not seeing their case manager within recommended timeframes. The impact of this is not theoretical. It is having very real effects and vulnerable children are being impacted in negative ways as they languish without direction or support and these effects will linger, potentially shaping the lives of these children into adulthood. Leading a government with heart means ensuring children's services have the workers they need to do the best by our children, meeting their needs and setting them up for a positive future. 

What about the state of Ashley Youth Detention Centre? It is still open, despite all recommendations that it be closed as soon as possible, despite the government's commitments to close it by late last year. Ashley Youth Detention Centre has been found to be unsafe and yet here we are, still without alternatives, still locking up children in there and not just locking them up, but locking up more of them, with documented increases in the number of young people detained over recent years. It is beyond time for Ashley to be closed and until that happens, we cannot be proud of the state of our state. 

We are not just locking up more children. We are also locking up more adults in Tasmania. We are locking them up and we are locking them down. The average number of people in Tasmanian prisons increased by 13 per cent in the last year, the rate of incarceration for Aboriginal Tasmanians is increasing under the Liberal government, and Tasmania has the lowest average out-of-cell hours per day in the country. From January through to mid-December last year, there was a lockdown in one or more units at the Risdon complex every single day.

Meanwhile, the Liberal government has stated repeatedly that people detained in Tasmanian prisons do not need whistleblower protections. I have a constant stream of people contacting my office with reports of mistreatment in our prisons. I have raised these concerns with the Minister for Corrections and Rehabilitation and been told, 'Nothing to see here. People can already safely raise their complaints'. I then point people towards the Custodial Inspector, but the Custodial Inspector himself made it clear last year that protections for people who report mistreatment in our prisons are insufficient. Given more people are being detained in our prisons and enduring higher levels of lockdowns, it is reasonable to assume that there will be mistreatment that needs reporting to the Custodial Inspector. Even if the numbers of reports are small, there must be a safe way for people to raise concerns and make complaints. Whistleblower protections for people who are detained in our prisons or work in our prisons need to be legislated to ensure Tasmania is doing all we can to protect the human rights of every person in our state.

That is also why we need to ensure sufficient funding of the Tasmanian National Preventive Mechanism (NPM). Australia is party to the international Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. That means we have an obligation to ensure no-one in Tasmania is deprived of their personal liberty. The NPM is responsible for visiting all locations where liberty may be taken from people and for monitoring the treatment of people. However, the Tasmanian NPM is not funded to fulfil its inspection role, despite the increased inspection obligations that have now come into effect across the state. The government must fund the NPM to fulfil its obligations so we can be confident the rights of all Tasmanians are being respected.

I have outlined a range of issues currently playing out across Tasmania. For many of these issues, we already know the solution. We know that when we offer timely, appropriate support that meets the needs of Tasmanian families, we can prevent many of the problems we see occurring across our state. Children who live in safe families are less likely to come into contact with youth justice. Families with secure housing, sufficient food and support when they need it are more likely to be safe for children. The level of investment in our communities feeds indirectly to outcomes such as the number of children in out-of-home care, the number of children in contact with youth justice and the number of people in our prisons. 

The community services sector does a power of work supporting people in need across Tasmania. However, from speaking with organisations, it is clear that they are not receiving the necessary funding to meet all the need. This is creating a cascade of greater need and costing people the opportunity to live happy, healthy lives. 

Instead of going on and on about investing in business, which has the freedom and resources to stand on its own two feet, the government should be investing in people. People are the heart of our state, not the economy. We would do well to care for them, support them, smooth the roughness of their lives and lift them up. That is what governments can and should do.

Turning to the electorate of Bass, I will start by talking about York Park Stadium. What a beautiful ground we have in the north of the state at York Park. By all accounts, it is one of the AFL's best playing surfaces in the country. Add to that its long association and history with football in this state, and it makes sense that York Park Stadium is where we base our Tasmanian AFL team. The development application for the $130 million upgrades has just been released and the planned transformation of the grounds will create an incredible venue for AFL in this state. I have spoken to a lot of people in Bass and overwhelmingly they tell me they do not want the Macquarie Point Stadium. A majority of people do not want it, we do not need it and we certainly cannot afford it. If the government was serious about addressing the financial situation we find ourselves in as a state, they would ditch the stadium and focus on an AFL base in the north of the state, saving a whole lot of money along the way.

The government has stated repeatedly this week that they support high-vis, yet when it comes to workers in a major industrial employer in Bass, the government has been strangely silent. I am talking about Liberty Bell Bay, an industrial plant in Bass that employs hundreds of people. Liberty Bell Bay is owned by GFG Alliance, a company who also own Whyalla steelworks in South Australia. Two weeks ago, in the face of the enormous debts owed by Whyalla Steelworks owners GFG Alliance, the South Australian government took the extraordinary step of placing the steelworks into administration and securing jobs for workers at the plant. On Monday of this week, KordaMentha revealed GFG Alliance owes $1.34 billion, including $567 million in debts being claimed by other GFG Alliance Group entities. 

Whyalla Steelworks going into administration raises serious questions about the future of Tasmania's Liberty Bell Bay facility. Is Liberty Bell Bay owed significant amounts of money as part of the terrible financial situation at Whyalla Steelworks? What is the government doing to ensure the future of Liberty Bell Bay is secure? The Premier and Treasurer are keen to tell us all week that private business does things well and they love private business. What have they done about Bell Bay? Have they had any conversations with the Premier of South Australia or the Prime Minister about the financial situation of GFG Alliance? What do they know about the financial status of Liberty Bell Bay? Is Liberty Bell Bay at risk? If it is, will the government step in like the South Australian government in an act of reverse privatisation, if you will, and secure the jobs of hardworking Tasmanians?

Forests are not something one traditionally associates with Bass, but there are areas of remnant old growth that are unique and need protection. The dry forests of the north-east are every bit as significant as the wet eucalypt forests of the south-west, and are home to incredible flora and fauna not found anywhere else in the state or indeed the world: creatures like the Mt Arthur burrowing crayfish, a threatened species found only in the north-east forests around Lilydale. These forests are home to towering Eucalyptus delegatensis trees, masked owls, Tasmanian devils and rare flora like the Mt Arthur boronia. These forests form the backdrop of one of Tasmania's most popular cultural events, PANAMA festival.

Locals have grown up walking the hiking tracks that run through these forests and know them as well as they know their own backyard. However, where the community sees wonder, the Liberal government sees woodchips. The Liberals' relentless assault on the environment continues with their announcement that they intend to open up 39,000 hectares of future reserve land for logging. Many of these parcels on the chopping block are in my electorate of Bass. These beloved forests are known by Forestry Tasmania as Lots 43, 44 and 45. They are on the list to be converted to permanent timber production zone land. Giant swamp gums and stringybarks will be converted from threatened species habitat to pulpwood.

A grassroots community-driven campaign forced Forestry Tasmania out of these forests in the early 2000s. Some members of this Chamber will remember this campaign well. I have met with these community members and they are ready and willing to fight to save their forests again, as are community members across Bass who do not want to see their beloved forests raised to the ground. 

The problems with the salmon fish-farming industry in the south of the state have been on full display on our beaches over the last few weeks. However, fish farms are not confined to the south of the state. There are salmon pens located on Kanamaluka/Tamar River. This summer, severe heatwaves covered the state. While we have sweltered in our houses, introduced Atlantic salmon sweltered in pens in the warming waters of Kanamaluka/Tamar River. The difference is people can turn on air conditioning if we need to, but not the salmon. They remain stuck in their pens with no escape. 

Marine heatwaves are going to continue to worsen as a result of climate change. From 2040, waters across north-eastern Tasmania will exceed 19°Celsius for nearly 100 days a year. Atlantic salmon cannot survive in these temperatures. Despite this, the government and industry are in lockstep, wanting to expand salmon farming leases across the Tamar, condemning millions of fish to boil to death in heating waters for the pursuit of short-term profit. These fish farms pollute the waters of the Tamar, adding excess nutrients in the water, which has flow-on effects for native marine species. Neighbours to the Rowella fish farm have reported slime and fish guts washing up on the shore of their properties. What a beautiful vision for the future of Kanamaluka: rotting fish guts and corpses lining the shore.

Warming waters, heat waves and floods are all predicted to increase in the north-east due to climate change. I talk regularly with people in Bass who are desperate for their leadership to take meaningful action on climate change. The Rockliff government has been missing in action. We have not seen any transformational action from this government on climate. We have seen tinkering around the edges for a handful of industry sectors while the big emitters like forestry get handed a licence to keep polluting.

The Premier was silent on so many of these important issues currently affecting our state, providing a notably lopsided, light-on assessment in his address. It would have been good for the Premier to give us a fuller, more accurate picture of how things currently are in Tasmania. We have much to cherish here, but there is also much work to do. The Greens call on the government to place Tasmanians at the heart of their policies and actions and truly work for the best interests of the people and the wild places of our state.

[4.31 p.m.]
Mr FAIRS (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I am very happy to contribute today in response to the state of the state address for 2025 by the Premier, Jeremy Rockliff.

I welcome the new member for Lyons, who is not in the Chamber at the moment, Casey Farrell, to the Chamber. I am always pleased to welcome another newbie to the Chamber and this place. Congratulations, Casey.

As Mr Rockliff stated, and as I campaigned this time about a year ago, a strong economy allows us to keep building the roads, bridges, schools, hospitals that Tasmanians deserve. This Rockliff Liberal government, with a fresh mandate, a refreshed team and some new ideas, has delivered. We will keep delivering. Most importantly, we made a commitment to keep Tasmania thriving, especially in my electorate of Bass. Let us be honest: it is the best part of Tasmania, starting at Launceston and extending up both sides of the Tamar to Bass Strait.

In our first 300 days, this Liberal government has delivered more than 1000 initiatives to benefit Tasmania. Think about that for a second - 1000 initiatives. This Liberal government has delivered 4000 social and affordable homes, with many more on the way. Do not forget that the government abolished stamp duty for first home buyers, helping young Tasmanians get into their home much sooner than they otherwise would have.

This Liberal government has delivered 2300 new healthcare workers employed across our much improved health system - doctors, nurses, paramedics. Ambulance ramping times are way down. In my seat of Bass, the Launceston General Hospital is now accessible by emergency care helicopters thanks to the government delivering the rooftop landing pad. It is literally saving lives. All of that and much more has been delivered despite the federal Labor government short-changing Tasmanians with regard to healthcare funding; costs that this government has had to bear.
This Rockliff Liberal government has delivered record investment in education. We have built two new schools, one of which is in Legana and the other in Brighton. I have been there and seen the massive development of Legana, going from the paddock that it once was to the school it is today. It is an absolutely fantastic sight to see.

Our school building blitz is delivering record investment to upgrade and improve schools all over the state. Our kids deserve the best we can provide. Still in education, this Rockliff government has delivered the biggest single reform to the curriculum in my memory. The reintroduction of phonics-based learning is a significant breakthrough, and we are seeing the improvements in literacy already.

We are rolling out healthy school lunches to a record number of schools, which is absolutely wonderful. As research shows, a well-fed student is a focused student. By providing nutritious meals at school, we are fuelling young minds for success not only in the classroom, but beyond.

All Australians have been feeling the effects of inflation and a slowdown of the national economy. This Rockliff government heard the voices of Tasmanians doing it tough and delivered $50 million in cost-of-living relief. During last year's severe weather event and power outages, the government stepped up with instant financial assistance to those badly affected, while mobilising all areas of government to get things fixed and working again.

We have helped families hit by floods, farmers battling drought, and rural communities needing better mental health support. We have been getting results, but we know there is more to do, and we will do it.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=14.0_D=9.8_C=0.84] I am incredibly proud and humbled to be a part of delivering the biggest reforms in youth engagement this place has ever seen, a space that is so important to me.  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=25.9_D=29.1_C=0.80] These include implementing the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into the Tasmanian Government's Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings. We are working collaboratively with all stakeholders in the youth sector to empower young Tasmanians to have a greater voice in developing government policy that affects them. I feel this is of paramount importance. I am continually meeting and discussing new ideas with stakeholders, members of the public and, most importantly, our youth.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=56.5_D=8.2_C=0.83] As Premier Rockliff noted in his state of the state address, this is a government with heart, but it is also a government that builds. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=65.5_D=12.0_C=0.75]  Those opposite spend a lot of time and effort trying to convince Tasmanians that this government cannot deliver large infrastructure.

Mr Willie - There is a giant billboard for it.

Mr FAIRS - I give you the Bridgewater bridge on time and in budget.  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=78.5_D=29.7_C=0.81] This magnificent structure will be open to vehicles this year, providing huge economic and productivity benefits to Tasmania for decades to come, Mr Willie.

Mr Willie - It is over budget and over time.

Mr FAIRS - This Rockliff Liberal government is not just thinking in the short-term, not going for the quick fix, but investing in infrastructure projects that will serve all Tasmanians well into the future. We need a strong economy to be able to deliver all of these reforms, programs and infrastructure projects.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=108.5_D=1.2_C=0.56]  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=110.4_D=24.3_C=0.80] This Rockliff Liberal government is very aware that we need to encourage even more business, more investment in Tasmania, producing more jobs, and enhancing our communities. Therefore, we need to reduce red tape. Like the Premier and all members on this side of the house, I hear it everywhere too. Virtually without exception, when I visit businesses in my seat of Bass, the cost of compliance with government regulations is hurting.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=135.7_D=1.6_C=0.92] Let me give you an example [Bookmark: Phr11_O=138.4_D=19.2_C=0.74] . A medium-sized manufacturer and industry service provider in my seat of Bass is forced to employ people not to make their superior products and delivering their outstanding services, but to comply with not one, not two but three levels of government regulations, red tape and bureaucracy out of control. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=158.5_D=14.4_C=0.87]  Unless something is done to reduce the burden of red tape, this company is actively considering closing down parts of its operations, because it cannot make a profit otherwise. If that happens, jobs will go, and the economy shrinks. There are no winners here.

Cut the red tape and they will expand, invest in their business and employ even more Tasmanians than they do now [Bookmark: Phr13_O=173.8_D=7.6_C=0.86]  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=182.2_D=25.2_C=0.84]  - not just hiring extra staff to fill out compliance forms, but to make useful things that are sold to Tasmanian companies and exported to the mainland and around the world.

Small businesses do not need red tape. We think they need a red carpet to roll out for tourists, visitors and customers. There are 26 licences to open a shop. That is not a business plan, that is an obstacle course. It is crazy.  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=208.1_D=10.3_C=0.63] I do not know how they even do it, to be honest. We are taking a slasher to all this unnecessary bureaucracy and red tape. We are taking a red pen to the red tape.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=219.3_D=8.9_C=0.86] We are also making the planning system faster, simpler, and not something that requires a degree in persistence. In business, as we know, time is money.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=229.1_D=23.3_C=0.73] We are making it easier for tradies to get jobs done. If you wear high-vis, you have no bigger supporter than this Liberal government. Whether you are starting a farm in the Tamar Valley, a brewery in Launnie or an eco-tourism business on the north-east coast, this government helps instead of hinders.

In the budget, we are taking a sensible path to surplus with no unnecessary taxes. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=253.5_D=29.6_C=0.84]  At the end of the day, it is simple. Less red tape means happier business owners and more growth. More growth means more jobs and higher paying jobs. Let us get on with it. More jobs, fewer regulations. Would it not be great to see fewer licences required to sell a coffee or even a pint at Kings Meadows?

Honourable Speaker, Tasmania is not just a great place to live, it is the best place in the country. Everyone in this House knows it. We are determined to make sure it stays that way.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=293.0_D=1.1_C=0.22] Mr GARLAND - Honourable Speaker,  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=295.4_D=9.6_C=0.82] I have been in this parliament for almost a year and the thing that strikes me is I see a lot of talking, but I do not see a lot of listening. If I could make one change to this parliament, it would be to urge everyone to truly listen to what each of us is saying, what the public is saying, and what the experts are saying. Is that not the role of a politician?

I turn to reply to the Premier's Address. The Premier wants to build a strong economy and to achieve that, he wants to give business a free pass. He wants a government to get out of their way. His Liberal government is not just a friend to big business, it has become their servant. Look at how the Premier knelt before the AFL, how he has caved in to the salmon and gambling industries, and introduced bills specifically crafted to green-light one-off projects for individual property developers like the State Coastal Policy Validation Bill and the Stony Rise Development bill.

Premier, the people of Tasmania expect more from you and from the government. They expect you to govern for all, not just the rich and powerful. As the gap between rich and poor widens, as some of our big businesses, like the billion-dollar salmon industry, get special treatment - profiting off our resources and not paying their fair share - while our debt surges, our ageing hospitals groan under the strain, our education outcomes plummet, the people of Tasmania see the unfairness in it all and it makes them angry. They do not want to see their leaders grovel to big business and let big business off the hook. They expect government leaders to stand up to big business to get the best deal for Tasmanians.

I want to read you a quote from Franklin D. Roosevelt:

… the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself. That, in its essence, is Fascism - ownership of Government by an individual, by a group, or by any other controlling private power.

After a year in this parliament, I am worried this is where we are headed.

Protecting scarce resources: meanwhile the world is increasingly experiencing the reality of overpopulation and over-development and the race is on for the remaining resources on this planet. The developers are coming to Tasmania because they know this government, this Labor-Liberal unity ticket, will give them whatever they want. They will give them our resources for a song. They will even give them subsidies to extract our resources. They may even sell them our state-owned assets. When I then hear the Premier say, in the same breath, that he wants to preserve what makes this place so incredibly special, I have to call this out.

What makes this state so incredibly special? Let us talk about Robbins Island. It is the largest migratory shorebird habitat in Tasmania and the meeting place of the 12 Aboriginal tribes of the north-west coast. It is surrounded by seagrass beds, which are crucial for the way they soak up carbon and as fish nursery breeding areas. As a north-west marine environment, we lived through years and decades of pollution, but now it is cleaned up and we are seeing quite remarkable things going on. We have albatrosses, terns, gannets - all those birds feeding on the baitfish that have built up, and we have tuna feeding on them. Now, at a time when that marine environment is going off its tits, they are talking about bringing salmon farms to that area.

Our native animals. What are we doing with our forests? Once upon a time, we selectively logged. We left trees there to be harvested 70, 80 years later. Now, we are knocking them all down, leaving a mess, and putting up plantations. That has been the history. Our native animals and beautiful coastlines that make this place so special deserve better than that.

I want to talk about reform. I want to see this government get down to the task of reform - real reform, not phoney wars against red tape. The government has had 11 years to get rid of red tape. A war on red tape is simply a red herring; a distraction from the government's own failure and mismanagement. The focus of this government needs to be on real reform. Real reform is not getting rid of laws we do not need. It is strengthening the laws we do need. It is making sure they are up to date to meet the challenges that lie ahead.

Many of the problems we are facing, and much of the frustration in the community, stems from the government abandoning its role to reform. This ongoing failure to update our most important laws erodes people's trust in government. This has to change. The government already knows which laws it needs to reform. It has been sitting on the reviews it commissioned about those laws for years now.

Let me remind them. The Living Marine Resources Management Act 1995; the government put out a discussion paper in February 2022. The then minister, Guy Barnett, acknowledged that the act had not had a major review in its 25-year history. Three years on, nothing. The Marine Farming Planning Act 1995, just as old. The government committed again to reviewing and updating this act in response to the finfish farm inquiry a few years ago, but, of course, no progress has been made there either. The Environmental Management and Pollution Control Act is another act the government promised to review and update in the wake of the finfish farming inquiry report in 2022. It acknowledged the need to strengthen compliance and penalty frameworks. Now we see rotting fish dot our beaches and fill our rubbish dumps, while the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) seems powerless to do much about it. Perhaps, that is how the government wants it to stay.

The Land Use Planning and Approvals Act 1993 now resembles Frankenstein's monster and has long been acknowledged as desperately needing an overhaul. Instead of committing to this overhaul, however, the government goes for the quick fix by setting up Development Assessment Panels (DAPs) and, essentially, sidelining local government from planning approvals. The Planning minister also wants to remove appeal rights for basically anyone except the developer. The Premier says these changes will make the system fair but fairer for who? I think what he means is fairer for the developers.

The Aboriginal Heritage Act 1975, now almost 50 years old, is completely outdated and unfit for purpose. It is an insult to Aboriginal people and an insult to this state. The government committed to overhauling this act after the 2021 review, a reform which the independent expert report in 2021 said should be progressed as a matter of urgency. Four years later, they are still working on it.

The Integrity Commission Act 2009 - in 2016, the former chief justice, William Cox, conducted an independent review of this act and released a report with 55 recommendations for change. In July 2022, the Department of Justice finally got around to preparing a discussion paper on various reforms, and yet nothing has been presented to this parliament. Now the government wants to walk away from the independent review of the integrity commission it promised last year. 

Premier, the election of the independents of the last election was a resounding call from the public to increase integrity oversight in this state. I can assure you I will be fighting hard to appropriately empower and fund the Integrity Commission to do its job properly.

Failing to deliver a solution to the housing crisis: If there is one human need that sits above all else, it is for a house, a home, a safe, secure, warm place to call your own. However, for quite some time, the state has experienced a housing crisis. While I acknowledge there are some factors contributing to this crisis that are beyond the state government's control, the simple fact is the government is not doing nearly enough to reduce this crisis. It is a blight on our state. I will have more to say on this during the year, but I want to touch on few areas now. 

Social and affordable housing: in December 2022, the government established Homes Tasmania to deliver social and affordable housing. Where are we now? Public housing waiting lists continue to grow, there is an increase in waiting times for priority housing applicants, and a failure to meet social housing targets. One of the many flow-on effects of this is a shortage of crisis accommodation. This leaves victims of domestic violence and their children who need to flee from abusive relationships nowhere to go. I have been trying to get the government to listen to the urgent pleas from Anglicare on this issue. When I raise it with Homes Tasmania and ministerial staff, all I get is blank looks.

Renters: as of the 2021 census, approximately 29 per cent of households in Tasmania were renters, equating to around 68,000 households. This number will continue to grow as the dream of owning your own home gets further out of reach, yet this government appears to have abandoned renters in favour of the real-estate industry of Tasmania. We know this because despite agreeing at National Cabinet in 2023 to very sensible, humane policy outcomes, collectively known as a 'better deal for renters', the government has failed to introduce any of these reforms to the Residential Tenancy Act 1997 to improve the rental situation in Tasmania. When it did try to introduce a minor change to allow pets in rentals, one of its a pre-election promises, it quickly shelved the bill when the Real Estate Institute of Tasmania came out swinging.

Rental affordability, security, and availability is about ensuring dignity and belonging in Tasmania, particularly for young people who are more likely to rent. Perhaps, this is one of the reasons young people are leaving this state in droves. In my electorate, rents are still increasing - up to double digits in some places. The increases are not matched by income growth, leading to higher rental stress.

I must also mention the short-stay industry. In what appears to be another broken election promise, the government acknowledged there is no doubt that the increasing number of houses on the short-stay market has reduced the availability of long-stay rentals and contributed to higher rents. They went to the election promising to impose a 5 per cent levy on the short-stay industry, which they said would deliver $11 million per year. This levy was going to help first-home buyers get their home, which would reduce pressure on the rental market. We are almost a year in and no sign of that levy.

Regarding financial mismanagement, the core job of the government is managing the budget. I think we should be clear about why the state's finances are so dire. I want to read this particular part of the Eslake report, from page 98, onto the record. 

… a significant contributor to the deterioration in Tasmania's fiscal position over the past decade has been the large increase in purchases of non-financial assets, commonly referred to as 'infrastructure spending', the vast majority of it funded by borrowing.

I am not sure if the government even read the Eslake report because they want to keep forging ahead with infrastructure we cannot afford and do not need: that is Marinus Link. We pay for the privilege of putting all the infrastructure in and we run the risk of being with that stranded infrastructure. Industry has been told that, under Marinus, their power prices will go up 30 per cent, and I believe it is pretty much the same for household consumers in this state.

There is also the stadium, of course. Here we are looking at trying to drag money and sell stuff, and we are throwing millions of dollars into a stadium that the majority of Tasmanians do not want. 

How do they get away with this sort of reckless indifference to our financial future? The answer is that they have a unity ticket with Labor on this. Every infrastructure project, no matter how unnecessary or irresponsible, is an opportunity for jobs. Never mind if these jobs are short-term, or if they are filled by fly-in, fly-out workers, or if those jobs continue to take people away from our local building industry, leaving no-one to build the 10,000 houses the government has committed to constructing. Look at all the big infrastructure spends in recent times. Labor has supported them, and yet Labor has the gall to stand up in parliament and decry the reckless infrastructure spending habits of this government. The public sees through this. While Labor positions itself as Liberal lite, it will continue to condemn itself to opposition and irrelevance. 

I have made my position very clear on the upcoming Budget. I have written an open letter to the Treasurer to say that I do not support this level of debt and the irresponsibility of this government's fiscal policy. I have said I will not support the Budget unless the government embraces some of the structural changes as recommended by Mr Eslake. I have also said I will not support cuts to health and education. 

Quite clearly, if you have maxed out the credit card, you slow down the spending, you stop building things you do not need, and you use existing infrastructure. However, this government does not listen to independent experts. Instead, it is going to balance the budget with cuts to the public service and selling off our public assets.

Let me read from the gospel of Saul again:

… cutting 'operating' expenses would have a bigger adverse impact on the 'Tasmanian economy' and on the most needy or vulnerable Tasmanians 'than raising revenues by an equivalent amount'…

When he talks about rising revenue, he is not talking about selling public assets. Nowhere does he recommend selling public assets. I do not like the idea of selling public assets, particularly essential services. They might help the budget bottom line, but everybody knows the costs for the public go up when you sell public assets to private entities. Then when those private entities cannot make a big enough profit, they disappear, leaving the government to pick up the pieces. That is why essential services must remain in public hands. Selling assets is taking the easy option to revenue raising, instead of giving serious consideration to some of the long-term revenue reforms, as recommended by Mr Eslake, like tax reform and increasing levies on companies extracting our resources. 

It is all about balance. This parliament, just like nature, needs balance. When both major parties jump on a unity ticket, there is no balance. You hear a lot of talking in this parliament but not much listening, and it is not just in the parliament. It is the whole of government. People are fed up with the tick-a-box charade of community consultation: people taking their time to provide feedback to the government only to be ignored again and again. They are sick to death of it. Listening is not just about listening to the concerns of business; it is about listening to everyone's concerns because, in a democracy, every vote is equal and every vote matters. 

The SPEAKER - Mr Garland, before putting the motion before the House, just a note that 'going off your tits' is not normally a parliamentary phrase. No one raised it, but we might avoid using that phrase again in the future, if we could. 

Mr Garland - I will.

The SPEAKER - Thank you. With that, the motion before the House is - 

That the Premier's Address be noted. 

Premier's Address noted.


ADJOURNMENT

[4.56 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House do now adjourn.


Answer to Question - Salmon Industry - Mass Mortality Crisis
Answer to Question - Salmon Industry - Mass Mortality Crisis - Salvage of Diseased Salmon
Answer to Question - TT-Line - Plans and Designs for New Devonport Infrastructure

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, I have three answers. In answer to Dr Woodruff's question to the Premier, the P. salmonis organism was determined in 2024 to have been around since at least 2021. It was previously classified as the east coast strain of the Tasmanian Rickettsia-Like Organism, TRLO-EC. This means that this strain of bacterium has been endemic to east and south-east coastal waters in Tasmania. Advice from the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania is that it is not the same strain as the P. salmonis found in Chile.

In answer to Mr Garland from the Minister for Primary Industries and Water, Ms Howlett, salmon harvested for human consumption must meet all the usual food safety requirements. Moribund or dead fish are not harvested for human consumption. In the extremely rare event that fish in marine farms require treatment with antibiotics, companies must advise the Environment Protection Authority director and the Chief Veterinary Officer before the treatment is applied, and comply with any requirements for residue testing and reporting. The treatment times of salmon are carefully managed to avoid food residues, and strict withholding periods apply post-treatment, which is common practice.

Finally, in response to Mrs Beswick's question asked of me, in relation to berth 3 at Devonport, the current focus of works is on the critical part: marine-side works. I am advised that concept designs for the land-side developments are currently being revised and will not be available until at least mid-year.


Penguins - Disappearance at Bicheno
[4.58 p.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, first of all, happy birthday. I am sorry it has taken me all day to get to that. 

The SPEAKER - Thank you. 

Ms BADGER - Over summer, I am sure that all members saw the worrying news that the penguins that are synonymous with our east coast community at Bicheno had disappeared. The Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania (NRE Tas) said that this event was not necessarily abnormal, and cited statistics of reported deaths to penguins, which showed no dramatic increases.

However, this certainly was not a normal event when we have Bicheno penguin tours closed for three weeks during peak season. They have spent 33 years observing the penguins locally. Over this period of the year, they would normally be seeing 500 to 600 penguins. At present, there are around 40. That is an exceptionally low number, but it is better than the none they had previously. I am also pleased to hear that the penguin tours in Bicheno are reopened, albeit for slightly smaller tours to reduce the impacts on the few penguins that have returned. 

The reported death statistics should not exclusively be relied upon for decision-making and investigating the serious scenario that has occurred. Locals do not necessarily know to report dead or dying penguins to NRE Tas. Yes, there is a page on the NRE Tas website which informs the best course of action if you see wildlife in need of assistance, but that is not sufficient. We have tourists who travel from around the world to come to Tasmania to experience our natural wonders, including the amazing little penguins. If they see one that is suffering, they would not think to call NRE Tas. In fact, they probably would not even know what NRE Tas is. 

To be absolutely clear, what happened over summer was not a mass death situation. It was a mass evacuation. That coincided with a 4°Celsius overnight increase in local ocean temperature. Our oceans are warming, our wildlife is suffering, and what are we doing?

Greens senator, Peter Whish-Wilson, and I have both separately called on the Tasmanian government to reconvene the Penguin Advisory Board, which comprised bird experts who can investigate and provide the science on the events that we have seen unfold. We both also asked for some signage to be put up around the local beaches so that people would know the right course of action if they saw birds suffering. This is particularly important when an outbreak of avian flu is nearly inevitable here. I cannot speak for Senator Whish-Wilson at the present, but I am certainly yet to receive a response. As is way too often the case, luckily the local communities have stepped up in lieu of government support. The Bicheno community information board is currently undergoing transformation to be dedicated to penguin interpretation and education for locals and tourists, so people know what is currently going on.

After the seriousness of this summer, it is very concerning to hear that feral cats have now taken up in the rookery at Bicheno. Also at Low Head there is an increasing problem with cats. This is our daily update on the Tasmanian Cat Management Plan 2024-2029, as cited in the Liberals' response to the 2024 State of the Environment Report, recommendation 13, as 'taking action on invasives'. I just checked the website before coming in here, and yet again, it is still not publicly available. Here is to hoping that 2024-2029 report is completed before 2029.

Again, I back the calls from the UTAS academics who, in January, urgently called on the government to establish a climate adaption fund for tourism in Tasmania. For those in Bicheno, that fund would mean increased research employment into monitoring of the penguins and seeing how they returned, which could help advise education for visitors and help us with our long-term understanding of what has happened. Certainly, empowering climate adaption is a very important step for our tourism businesses.

Finally, we cannot let this first week of parliament pass without acknowledging the tremendous efforts of those who have worked and are continuing to work on the bushfires across our West Coast, Takayna and the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (TWWHA). We are all very grateful for the huge efforts made to ensure that our ancient Huon pine stands in Takayna and the Harman and Wilson rivers are still standing, and similarly with pencil pines in the Windermere area. 

I note that this evening, Andrew Darby is launching a book at Fullers called The Ancients, which is a journey to find the world's oldest surviving trees in wild Tasmania. That work is incredibly prudent at the moment. If anyone can afterwards, feel free to pop down there. His book will increase in value as it documents this extraordinary world that we stand to lose if we do not take climate action now.


Kunanyi/Mt Wellington - Proposed Zip-Line Development

[5.04 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) – Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about  [Bookmark: _Hlk192177180] Kunanyi/Mt Wellington and express my disappointment at the planning assessment for a private commercial zip-line development on the mountain. 

As we know and is widely accepted, Kunanyi is a cherished backdrop to our city and an incredibly valuable living natural and cultural landscape, including an Aboriginal cultural landscape. Connected by reserved land to the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, it is truly remarkable to stand in the city, look at the Organ Pipes and recognise that they are part of a protected landscape, from Fern Tree all the way to the far south-west coast.

Kunanyi is a special place for the Palawa - in the words of elder Theresa Sainty: 'omnipresent in the landscape, described in the creation stories as a sacred place where the ancestor spirits are laid to rest'. Of course, in contemporary terms, it is a special place from a broader cultural perspective. It has colonial heritage dotted around with huts, aqueducts and other structures and ruins. Today, it is a highly cherished natural place where locals and visitors alike seek out exercise, amenity, connection and solace. Unique species iconic to Tassie call it home.

So many people love Kunanyi, such that they consistently stand up to defend it. As the Wellington Park Management Trust's historical notes state, there have been eight cable car proposals for Kunanyi since the early 1900s, and I quote, 'all have been strongly protested by the citizens of Hobart'. So it was, that more than 800 people made submissions to the City of Hobart planning assessment process into the zip-line proposal. In the words of the assessment report, the council received 828 representations regarding the proposal. The representations received were almost exclusively opposed to the proposal. Let me take a moment at this point to acknowledge those representors and say thank you. Time and again, you step up to defend Kunanyi. Among those representors opposing the zip-line were the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre, the Aboriginal Land Council of Tasmania, the Tasmanian National Parks Association and Respect the Mountain.

This brings me to the assessment report. Representors, including Aboriginal representatives, raised the issue that the Aboriginal heritage reports were not compliant with the government's own guidelines. A local Aboriginal Heritage officer was not involved. He withdrew from the project. No consultation with Aboriginal people was carried out. Since the report was conducted following an onsite assessment, the actual location of the built structures has moved.

I have talked at length in this place, including yesterday, about the acknowledged failures of the Aboriginal Heritage Act. Government has long admitted that it does not work, including in this place in 2021, but it delays tabling a new bill to fix it. Meanwhile, developments like this one are assessed against the flawed act. Despite the fact that current protections are only afforded to archaeological objects under the footprint of the development, no assessment was carried out for the development's new footprint.

I am appalled and ashamed. For all the talk in here every day acknowledging traditional owners and paying respect to Aboriginal people, Tasmania cannot even ensure that their ancestral heritage is properly assessed, let alone actually protected. Shame on us all.

Then there is the issue of use. This proposal, by its owner's admission on the front page of the development application, is an adventure tourism development. According to the park management plan, these are prohibited in almost all cases in the Springs and the recreation zone, so the application passes itself off as a transport depot and distribution use. Despite not meeting the definition of 'Forms of public transport that have the potential to effectively move large numbers of people', the planning official has recommended approval, because it can be considered an aerial ropeway. This proposal will shift only 12 to 24 thrillseekers per hour, but it is allowed to be passed off as public transport. What a joke - not least when we have got a public transport system that itself cannot cope.

This is no way to assess private developments on a much-loved public reserve. There is hope the council will reject the advice because it is wrong. They can vote to protect the integrity of the mountain. If they do not, as they feel constrained to accept poor advice, it is case in point as to why third-party appeal rights to test the merits of a development assessment are so very important and need to be retained. 

Tasman Peninsula - Mobile Coverage Issues

[5.08 p.m.]
Ms BUTLER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I rise on the Adjournment tonight to advise or report to the House on a community meeting I attended at Taranna which was hosted by the Tasman Council. The community hall was well-attended; probably about 80 people there. Tabatha Badger was also present at that meeting as were the federal candidates for Lyons.

One of the reasons that the community meeting was called by the Mayor, Rod Macdonald, in the first place was to address the inconsistent and long-standing issue that the Tasman community have with their mobile coverage and data service. When I was sitting here this morning and we were doing our state of the state addresses, I was reminded of the $10 billion debt or projected debt by the time of the next election. Imagine what that kind of money could buy us when it comes to mobile and digital coverage. Imagine how many times we could cover our island and make sure that every single person had the best coverage possible. That is the reality of having that kind of debt sitting there.

Going back to the Tasman community, what I decided to do during the night was write down a lot of the comments that the community were providing. It was quite well-run insofar as that it was attended by Telstra. I did feel quite sorry for the Telstra state manager. He did try to do as good a job as possible; however, it was quite a hostile reception. Reception is the perfect word because that is a huge issue that the community has been dealing with for many years. There was also representation from NBN. They also did a good job of trying to provide some insight into why there are such a lot of problems in that community.

Let us consider though that after the massacre, that community was provided with a promise that mobile coverage would be fixed. Then after the bushfires, the Tasman Peninsula was again promised that their mobile and data coverage would be fixed and that they would not be subjected to having to drive five kilometres to try and get in a mobile range. Both those promises have never been honoured. I believe there is a matter of decency when it comes to that.

For the record, I am going to write in some of the feedback that came from that community. One of the people who attended last year said, 'Tasman data slowed down with the end of the 3G network'. Over summer, there were 28,000 people on the Tasman Peninsula every day. Phil Rowley, whose business is airport transfer taxi driving, stated that on 15 January he could not take payments from guests. How embarrassing is that for him? On 25 February, there was no coverage for customers at all. A volunteer ambulance officer said pagers were not working due to the congestion and there was no coverage for emergency services.

There is a lack of security as well for residents who are trying to use two-factor authentication. A lot of the times they are not able to conduct that process because of that really poor coverage. Businesses cannot receive Airbnb bookings, cannot do Zoom or Teams meetings. They cannot access government services. They cannot book doctor's appointments outside of the area.

Anne stated she cannot get a phone signal between 10.30 a.m. and 5.00 p.m. every day. She is at Murdunna. Murdunna cannot get a phone signal or wi-fi now. There is a gentleman there who climbs onto his roof in order to make telephone calls. It is the year 2025; this is just a bit ridiculous, especially when this community has been promised this for a long time. There is a whisky distillery that relies on reputation for accommodation. They get one-star reviews constantly from their customers because there is no wi-fi access or mobile coverage for their beautiful business.

The Tasman Gazette moved to Sorell due to poor coverage. There is no point of sale at the Koonya Garlic Festival and customers walked away from sales. The nursing home has problems where families cannot connect with loved members. This is something we are going to be really concentrating on. 

I will come back to the House as we progress.


Drugs - Pill Testing at Music Festivals

[5.13 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I want to talk about pill testing again. This weekend there is A Festival Called PANAMA. It is beginning tomorrow and it will see about 1500 people going to enjoy music and art from around Tasmania, and coming from around the world. To all of you who are going to A Festival Called PANAMA, I hope that you enjoy one of the most iconic Tasmanian music festivals.

I bring this up again after Party in the Paddock. I spoke on the same matter before that festival. Apart from PANAMA being on this weekend, last weekend in New South Wales a pill testing trial at the Yours and Owls Festival was described by the New South Wales Health minister as a success. That trial will continue for at least the next year. Congratulations to New South Wales and the New South Wales Labor government. I acknowledge in particular, Labor MP, Cameron Murphy, who has managed to turn his government's position around on pill testing. I also acknowledge the work that Greens colleagues, including Cate Faehrmann and Jenny Leong in New South Wales have been doing to strongly call for pill testing for many years, as are many colleagues around the country.

Around 100 people used the service at the Yours and Owls Festival, which was run by New South Wales Health, and several chose to dispose of their drugs after having them checked. At Beyond the Valley festival in Victoria over 600 samples were checked. Some who had their pills checked made the decision after finding out that what was in their pills was not what they had thought. Nobody was told their drugs were completely safe, but they were empowered to make a choice. Importantly, every single one of them had a discussion with a health professional about harm minimisation so not only were they educated but they were empowered to make a decision about whether they should hold onto those pills or not.

As well as giving information to potential users, the results gathered at the pill-testing sites helps medical professionals understand which substances are in circulation. That is why doctors support it and why it is being trialled in mainland states all across the country and has been in place for almost 20 years elsewhere, Europe in particular. The Royal Australian College of GPS has said that up to 64 deaths could have been avoided since 2000. It is often young people but not always young people. It is so important to have that harm minimisation in place. The Greens sponsored the petition by the organisers of Party in the Paddock more than five years ago calling for the government to introduce such a scheme here. It is disappointing that no action has been taken. In fact, the Health minister continues to rule out even a trial. It does not include legislative change. It could be done with the stroke of the minister's pen.

The law and order prohibition model of drug laws has been a failure. We know that people are going to choose to use drugs at these kinds of events. It is just part and parcel of the experience for some people. We can either choose to put in place an evidence-led preventative harm minimisation strategy or we can bury our heads in the sand and continue to see people hospitalised or worse when something goes horribly wrong. What a waste. The Greens will continue to prosecute this case. Criminalising a health issue is not the way to go. It is pure politics. 


Australia Day - Activities

[5.18 p.m.]
Mr FERGUSON (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to reflect on Australia Day. I want to highlight what it means to be proud to be Australian, I am grateful to be Australian, but also the fantastic events held across my electorate of Bass. I also want to recognise the amazing individuals who were recognised for contributing to our Australian way of life.

As a sign of changing views, Woolworths made the sensible decision to put Australia Day merchandise back on its shelves. The company said, 'We will be celebrating Australia Day as a team and with our customers'. Woolworths later went on to say, 'Our store team members are also welcome to celebrate the day in store'. That should not have been such an ordeal, but it would appear that Woolworths recognised that it made a commercial mistake the year prior and that their customers are more patriotic than they gave them credit for. Nonetheless, credit where it is due.

Coinciding with this, I would like to bring to the notice of the House that there is plenty of public research this year which shows increasing support for Australia Day on 26 January. The Resolve Political Monitor, the Roy Morgan SMS poll, and the Deakin University Contemporary History Survey all showed significantly more support to retain our national day as it is. As a further example, the Institute of Public Affairs survey results showed the 69 per cent of respondents agreed with the statement that Australia Day should be celebrated on 26 January, up 6 per cent on the year before. Only 14 per cent disagreed, down 3 per cent. 

I witnessed that sentiment across my electorate of Bass in the northern community at events that I attended. As a grateful Australian, I celebrated by attending George Town's citizenship ceremonies. It is a great event where it is always an honour to witness people becoming new citizens of our wonderful country - even more so on this special day.

Honourable Speaker, I know you will join me in wanting to congratulate Dr Tim Mooney, who was named George Town's Citizen of the Year for his extensive and generous contribution to the life and health of the people of George Town and the district. I know Mr Wood will join me as well in congratulating him. It is a wonder that he has not been Citizen of the Year many times already. 

It was also a great opportunity to listen to Australia Day ambassador, John Zeckendorf, who is known to many of us in this Chamber. He has travelled all the way from Kingston to George Town to talk about his Everest climb, our wonderful country, and the importance of Australia Day to him. John is a very inspirational person and, I understand, the only Tasmanian to have summited Everest.

I then spent the afternoon at Scottsdale's Australia Day pool party. This has become a regular event in my calendar. I look forward to spending that time celebrating with my fellow Australians in the beautiful north-east. This included locals who travelled from all over the state just to be there for that weekend. There are also many other successful events in Bass, such as the Greens Beach event, organised by the hardworking volunteers of Kelso Fire Brigade; the Riverside pool party organised by the West Tamar Council; and the George Town pool party. It was inspiring. 

In the moments I have remaining, I want to celebrate the Australian of the Year awards. It was inspiring to watch this year's awards and see such a worthy recipient of Australian of the Year, co-founder of Fight MND and AFL legend Neale Daniher AO. Other inspiring recipients included senior Australian of the Year, co-founder of Wheelchairs for Kids, Brother Thomas Oliver Pickett AM. I hope I can speak for other members when I say that the story that was broadcast on the ABC about both of these wonderful Australians and their acceptance speeches were extremely inspiring. They both spoke with such clarity about the contributions of volunteers and the generous donors across our nation. Who could not be moved, in particular, by Neale Daniher's acceptance?

Further to this, I was so inspired to see Tasmanians stepping up as finalists and want to congratulate founder of Sea Forest, Sam Elsom, on winning our 2025 Tasmanian Australian of the Year. He is doing amazing things with reducing stock methane emissions in the global livestock industry, and the many other nominees for state awards make us very proud, in particular Penelope Bloomfield, Ariarne Titmus, and Keren Franks. We are very proud of the winners of the Tasmanian Awards.


Pokies - Impact on Tasmanians

[5.23 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to raise the impact of poker machines on the Tasmanian community. First, let me congratulate Michael Ferguson for naming the pokies barons who have so much influence over this government and its policies in his state of the state contribution yesterday. Mr Ferguson said, 'I was continually appalled, but not surprised, at the behaviour of some in the gambling lobby'. He sees the industry, despite their massive profits, lobbying for still more. Mr Ferguson remains committed to mandatory precommitment cards in the public interest. In fact, he has vowed it so. He also reassured the House that the Premier would be, too. Is that true?

In October last year, the Greens asked the Premier if he had sold out Tasmania and made a secret deal with the pokies lobby during the election campaign to abandon mandatory precommitment cards for poker machines. These were the nation-leading reforms that this parliament had committed to in 2022 to help problem gamblers and their families, who also suffer the financial and health impacts of rigged, predatory machines. There are millions lost a year by Tasmanians to pokies. The mandatory card would have set default loss limits of $100 a day, $500 a month, and $5000 a year. These limits were recommended by our own Tasmanian Liquor and Gaming Commission and a range of community advocates, and shown by the gambling industry to be entirely possible.
We asked the Premier multiple times if he had done this deal. He would not deny it and, finally, in November, the Premier admitted he had ditched the precommitment card. He blamed the MaxGaming report but would not release it to the public. He also commissioned a report from Deloitte on social and economic impacts of the card. Again, he would not release the terms of reference, even when the Legislative Council asked him for them. Information had to be drawn out of the government piece by piece. In December, the MaxGaming Report was released to the public a few days before Christmas, in an effort to bury it. The Premier had said the report showed the card was too expensive and complex to implement, but we saw none of this in that report. What it showed was the precommitment card was ready to be implemented by MaxGaming. It was planned down to the finest detail. All it needed was the minister to sign off.

Last week, the Greens received another RTO with correspondence on the Deloitte report which fills in more of the blanks. It showed that as far back as January last year, the pokies industry were lobbying for the precommitment card to be dropped. They were using a report that Federal hotels had commissioned back in 2023 from Deloitte.

The Finance minister at the time, Michael Ferguson, was steadfast against the gambling lobby in his letter. He pointed out the issues with their biased report - letters that Mr Ferguson recommitted to in this place yesterday. After this exchange last year, the Federal CEO, Greg Farrell, went crying to daddy, emailing the Premier with their correspondence. What we saw after the election was that at the first possible opportunity Michael Ferguson was removed from the Finance portfolio. In mid-August, his office urgently requested a report from Deloitte on the social and economic impacts of the card. It sounds suspiciously like the report that the pokies lobby had already commissioned from Deloitte. It cost the taxpayers a wasteful and entirely unnecessary $330,000. 

We see here why the Legislative Council was not given the terms of reference for this review when they asked. It is because they did not exist, such was the urgency in which the Premier commissioned that report. It is very obvious at this point that they were looking for any way they could to ditch the precommitment card. They wanted to do it quickly. In the end, the Greens questions exposed the Premier's deceit before he could use the report as a scapegoat and he blamed it on the MaxGaming Report instead. What reassurance does Mr Ferguson have from the Premier on the precommitment card? 

Until now, the only people who can trust the Premier's word are the pokies lobby because they are the ones who are lining the Liberals' pockets. They have been controlling things in the state for decades, well before the infamous 2018 election. That was the election that pulled Labor back into line, now continuing to parrot the lines of the pokies lobby and having signed a secret MOU to protect the industry's profits at the expense of Tasmanians. We do not know exactly how much money the pokies barons have donated because it is hidden behind weak political donation disclosure laws. 

The Greens do not take donations for these predatory corporations. We will keep speaking up for vulnerable Tasmanians. We will be keeping a close eye on whether Mr Ferguson or the gambling industry are right on this one. We are backing Mr Ferguson.

The House adjourned at 5.28 p.m.

Tuesday 8 April 2025

The Speaker, Ms O'Byrne, took the Chair at 10.00 a.m., acknowledged the Traditional People, and read Prayers.


RECOGNITION OF VISITORS

The SPEAKER - We will start by welcoming to the Gallery Year 11 and 12 legal studies students from Rosny College. Their colleagues got to come to a day without parliament. Hopefully they will have a more entertaining one.

I will also ask you all just to wave at Bob Pill. Hi, Bob.

Members - Hear, hear.


QUESTIONS

Energy - Transmission Costs for Major Industrials

Mr WINTER question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

[10.02 p.m.]
On 2 April, you issued a media release which stated: 

Our Major Industrials have faced nowhere near a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs, as claimed by the Opposition.

Do you stand by your statement or have you since been advised that, in fact, transmission prices have gone up by almost 20 per cent last year and almost as much this year?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I certainly stand by my answer of last week. I also stand by this government's excellent record in keeping energy prices among the very lowest in the country - in fact, the lowest regulated energy price of any state in the country. We have the highest level of concession of any state in the country, in stark contrast to the Labor government which oversaw a 65 per cent increase in energy prices during its term of government.

I reject the Leader of the Opposition's question and the assertion that the major industrials (MIs) faced a 20 per cent increase in transmission costs, which he came in and said last week, which is categorically incorrect.

Over a year ago, on 30 April 2024, the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) approved TasNetworks' final 2024-2029 regulatory proposal, which sets the business's allowed revenue investment pricing for the next five years, including major industrials. In the last 10 years, transmission costs have gone down in real terms according to the AER. In the last 10 years, transmission costs have gone down, Mr Winter. Major industrials have commercial arrangements with TasNetworks and that is within the maximum allowable limit which TasNetworks is able to recover.

We recognise on this side of the House that we need to be supporting our major industrials at this time. There are substantial headwinds being faced by some of those businesses and, obviously, energy is a major input cost for those businesses. We are committed to doing what we can to support our MIs. We are also committed to keeping our energy prices as low as they possibly can be.


Energy - Transmission Costs for Major Industrials

Mr WINTER question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

[10.05 a.m.]
Last week, you were asked whether you stood by your statement on 2 April and you told this House:

The assertion that our major industrials faced a 20 per cent increase in transmission cost is categorically incorrect.

Do you stand by that statement or will you finally correct the record? Or did you mislead parliament knowing that your energy policy is putting Tasmanian jobs at risk?

Mr Ellis - It looks like it is going to be an easy morning.

The SPEAKER - He is your minister and he has not reached the lectern yet, Mr Ellis.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I stand by the statements I have made in the parliament. I have no problem doing that at all.

I have a question I would pose to the room about the opposition's statement about how it would seek to repair the budget by maximising the returns from the GBEs - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass, Ms Finlay, and Mr Ellis.

Mr DUIGAN - Presumably, one of those and chief among those is TasNetworks. What would that landscape look like for our major industrials should Labor then be hiking up the opportunity it sees in seeking more in transmission costs from our major industrials?

I am happy to stand by the statements that I have made. As I say, transmission costs in Tasmania have gone down in real terms over the past 10 years. Likewise, residential energy costs. In real terms they have gone down against inflation in the last 10 years.


Planning - Subversion of Processes

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.07 a.m.]
Your government has a growing public reputation for arrogance, secrecy, a sustained recklessness towards the state's finances, privatisation of state assets with no mandate, public sector sackings, and a near $2 billion stadium you are threatening to jam through this place without proper assessment or public input. If you think Tasmanians are angry about the stadium now, wait until you and Labor try to pass a fast-track approval bill against the wishes of the overwhelming majority. 

A dud deal signed behind closed doors with the AFL, a bespoke rubber-stamp bill for your Stony Rise developer mates, development assessment panels to override local government and communities - it seems there is no planning process your government will not attempt to corrupt or subvert. Given this sorry track record, why should Tasmanians trust you to do anything other than deliver for the big end of town and your donors?

Mr Abetz - Time, time.

The SPEAKER - I will call the Premier to the question, and I can tell the time too, thank you, Mr Abetz.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. I reject a number of the assertions made in the preamble to the actual question right at the end. In fact, I reject all of them because they are incorrect. 

I know that your position on the stadium has been consistent. Our position has been consistent as well. We have been very open and transparent the whole way on the matters you raised about a right-sized public service, potential divestment of public assets, the stadia infrastructure and the pathway to the planning process.

Mr Bayley - Special legislation? Last week.

The SPEAKER - Deputy leader of the Greens, everyone else is being very quiet.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The stadium and the 4000 jobs that will be created in construction - ongoing jobs - a huge boost to our community, building it on vacant land and, in the process, getting rid of sewage works, which you obviously love to keep - this is a huge opportunity and an opportunity we cannot lose. I implore you to put aside the politics for once. I said yesterday on SEN radio with Brent Costelloe how important this infrastructure is not only for our own team, but for young people. It is actually not about me or you. It is about the aspiration of our young people right across Tasmania. In every single circumstance or background, our young kids need aspiration and a pathway to achievement. 

I have seen that in the MyState Arena investment and the investment we are making in the JackJumpers, where we have young kids engaged in basketball more than ever before. It has created a challenge for government in the fact that we need more basketball courts, but what a great challenge that is where participation in basketball has increased by 10 per cent or more. What about the Auskick participation that is going through the roof as well? Do you seriously want to destroy all of that? I find it unfathomable that you want to destroy all that. 

My message to Tasmanians on the stadium infrastructure is very simple: parliament will have its say.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary from the Leader of the Greens.

Dr WOODRUFF - The Premier exhorted us to put aside the politics around the stadium. Does that mean that you are considering dropping your idea of special legislation and you will allow this to go through the Project of State Significance (POSS) process?

The SPEAKER - I will allow the Premier to answer the question, possibly close to a new question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I am canvassing all options. As I openly said to you, I actually want to get something done - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens, minister Ellis, and members on my right, and Mr O'Byrne, the member for Franklin - thank you. The Premier has 45 seconds to address the supplementary.

Mr ROCKLIFF - and stand up to political organisations like yours that oppose every single damn thing that goes on in Tasmania and not only oppose things that go ahead, but want to stop things that are already employing many thousands of Tasmanians. I will canvass all options because I am passionate about this project and passionate about the opportunity for hospitality and the growth in private sector businesses in and around the stadium infrastructure - actually in the whole of Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.9_D=17.4_C=0.73]  when it comes to this project. 

Yes, I am considering my options, but I can guarantee you this: the submissions due in on 8 May will be taken account of irrespective of the POSS process or an enabling legislation process. 

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the supplementary has expired.


Health System - Non-Standard Food Items and Efficiency Dividends

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=58.9_D=1.9_C=0.40] Mr O'BYRNE question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

[10.13 a.m.]
Last week, I asked you [Bookmark: Phr4_O=65.1_D=27.8_C=0.69]  about the impact your government's blunt efficiency dividends are having on our hospitals. I told you that in the scramble to meet efficiency dividends, your department was restricting basic food items for patients and workers in hospitals. In response to my question, you said:

Milo, bread, tea, water and icy poles on hot days are essential for staff and patient wellbeing.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=93.7_D=26.6_C=0.81] You also later assured the House that there were no changes to the ordering processes for standard food items. However, the department has shifted many hospital food essential items onto a non-standard items list, which I have here. Any orders for Milo, bread, bottled water, jams or margarine now have to be ordered with a written justification, which must then be personally signed off either by the Chief Executive or the Executive Director. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=120.8_D=9.9_C=0.69]  How can you justify this crude, penny-pinching measure? How can you say that these items are essential to patient and staff wellbeing whilst also stripping away their access to them?

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=133.1_D=2.1_C=0.31] ANSWER
 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=136.6_D=29.4_C=0.85] 
Honourable Speaker, I thank the independent member for Franklin for his question. As I said to the House last week following the member's question, I spoke to the secretary that day about this matter. He assured me that he fully appreciates that things like Milo, bread, tea, water and icy poles on hot days are essential for staff and patient wellbeing. He advised me that these are still available across the Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr9_O=166.1_D=25.4_C=0.81]  Health Service, and he assured me that he was going to follow up the allegations that had been raised with hospital leadership and ensure that processes for ordering and supplying these items is simplified and clear to all staff.

If the member can scan in that document and send it to me, I assure him that I will follow this up again with the secretary today.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Alternative Planning Process Impact on Cenotaph

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=194.6_D=2.2_C=0.41] Mrs PENTLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.15 a.m.]
You have confirmed you are exploring an alternative planning process for the Macquarie Point Stadium. What would a change mean in terms of impact on the Hobart Cenotaph? Will you again choose a process that overrides the protections contained in the Sullivans Cove Planning Scheme?

ANSWER
 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=223.7_D=10.0_C=0.53] 
Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. That is why in the previous answer I made it clear that [Bookmark: Phr13_O=235.9_D=25.3_C=0.82]  community feedback is very important. Community feedback is happening now through the Project of State Significance process, including, no doubt, the views of veterans. It is also taking into account other matters that were raised in the issues paper as presented by the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) last week, as perplexing as some of those matters were [Bookmark: Phr14_O=261.8_D=4.0_C=0.90] . All the submissions [Bookmark: Phr15_O=266.4_D=15.2_C=0.77]  put into the process, irrespective of a Project of State Significance planning process or an enabling legislation process, for want of a better word, will be taken into account, including the views of our veterans and the impact [Bookmark: Phr16_O=282.0_D=1.9_C=0.79]  on the Cenotaph.

Macquarie Point Stadium - AFL Deal Renegotiation

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=286.1_D=3.5_C=0.48] Ms JOHNSTON question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.17 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=293.0_D=11.6_C=0.67] You were quick to reference proper process for the stadium when rushing to seek advice about bypassing the POSS process - a planning process your government created.

You said last week:

I am considering all options, given the significance of this project for Tasmania and Tasmanians. Yes, I have sought advice, and why wouldn't I?

In questioning this morning, you have said that you are canvassing all options. If you are truly canvassing all options, have you sought and/or received advice about renegotiating the AFL deal, and will you table that advice?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, we have not received advice specifically on renegotiating the entirety of the AFL deal. We are working very closely with the AFL on the complexities of not only the stadium infrastructure, but also the high performance centre, which is a fantastic investment for the Kingborough community. Unfortunately, we have a local member in another place arguing against that community facility, which I find absolutely extraordinary. We will continue to work with the AFL on the number of challenges that the infrastructure of the stadium presents. We want to ensure that the AFL and AFLW teams are playing in the first round in 2028, and earlier, if that is at all possible. It is the full intention of both the AFL and the state government to work through those issues.

Supplementary Question

Ms JOHNSTON - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms JOHNSTON - The Premier has indicated he has not sought advice. Will the Premier be seeking that advice and renegotiating, and will he table the advice that he has received on various aspects of the contract?

The SPEAKER - The first part of the question might be a new one. The second part is related to the original question on taking advice.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I am happy for you to engage with the AFL and seek an update if you like; and I am sure that they will be more than willing to engage with you and, indeed, the Tasmanian Football Club and all associated.

As I said very clearly last week, Ms Johnston, there are many people in the areas that you represent who want this team - many young people who want this team and can only dream of playing for their own team in their own colours and singing their own song. I do not know why you want to destroy the dream for the sake of politics.
I made the point yesterday on the radio - I understand the Greens and their views on certain matters, but why not accept the fact that this is good for Tasmania and hold us to account on ensuring that it is the most environmentally friendly and sustainable stadium that has ever been built?

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time has expired. I remind members to direct their questions and answers through the Chair so we do not personalise the debate. 


Department of State Growth - Jobs

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.20 a.m.]
Documents obtained by the Labor Party reveal the Department of State Growth has a policy in place to offer staff $60,000 to quit their jobs. This is a redundancy program by another name. How many jobs are you planning to abolish in the Department of State Growth?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. This is a sensible measure. What I believe you are referring to is the Workplace Renewal Incentive Program, which we have doubled from $30,000 to $60,000. That is one way that we can ensure we have the right-sized public service, and that is what we intend to do. 

You come in here every single day and you talk about debt and Armageddon. These are very uncertain times globally, and what Tasmanians expect from their political leaders is not fear and the politics of fear, but rather sensible conversation and sensible policy initiatives to be put on the table. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - What we have put on the table are policies to cut red tape, increase and grow the economy, support more jobs, implement GBE reform, and measures to right-size the public service. Those are sensible measures that we can work through to ensure - 

Members interjecting.

Ms Haddad - You will cut public sector jobs. You will employ consultants at double the cost.

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark.

Mr ROCKLIFF - that in these uncertain times we are able to have a sensible pathway to surplus and continue to grow our economy. You can laugh all you like, honourable member, but this economy in Tasmania has grown from about $28 billion in 2014, if my memory serves me correctly, to now over $40 billion.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark.

Mr ROCKLIFF - When it comes to the amount of debt we have and the ratio to the size of the economy, we are performing very well and in the top three states.

Dr Broad - Oh.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Well, you can be negative again, Dr Broad.

Dr Broad - Let us see your budget then.

The SPEAKER - Dr Broad does not need to comment at the moment.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Let us see yours.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I have been waiting for an alternative budget for 11 years from you lot.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I am not sure what gave you the impression that I was going to allow a chat across the Chamber today. This is question and answer time. I am taking a point of order from the member.

Mr WINTER - Standing Order 45, Speaker, relevance. The question was how many jobs are you planning to abolish in State Growth? The Premier has not gone near that.

Members interjecting.

Ms Haddad - Groaning about those job losses?

The SPEAKER - Can I just say for the member for Clark and the members on my right, the member is allowed to bring a point of order. I draw the Premier to the original question on job cuts.

Mr ROCKLIFF - As we have said before, we put the right policy mechanisms in place, including doubling the Workplace Renewal Incentive -

Mr Winter - How many jobs have to go?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Program from $30,000 to $60,000. We want to ensure we prioritise -

The SPEAKER - The time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question; not unexpected.

Mr WINTER - My supplementary is the exact question I asked. Can the Premier outline to the House how many jobs are on the chopping block in the Department of State Growth under this program?

Mr ROCKLIFF - We have Workplace Renewal Incentive Programs across every department. This is a mechanism and an opportunity to ensure that we do have the right-sized public service, and one that is focused and is delivering the best possible services to the Tasmanian community with minimal disruption to individuals across the public service in a sensible and measured way. We have learned the lessons from the Labor-Greens past. When you cut really deeply, it impacts not only of the individuals, but also the services.

Mr Willie - You were just racking up the debt. That is what you were doing.

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark, Mr Willie.

Mr ROCKLIFF - There you go, talking about debt again. What I am looking forward to is Dr Broad and Mr Willie working together -

The SPEAKER - We will not find out, because the Premier's time has expired.

Mr Abetz - You will be waiting a long time.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Private Partnership

Mr BAYLEY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.26 a.m.]
Your day one flagship election promise was to somehow cap the taxpayer contribution to the stadium at $375 million. You said you would find a private partner to fund the stadium cost shortfall, and apparently any cost blowouts too. It has been more than a year since then and no partner has been announced. Both economist Dr Nicholas Gruen and the Planning Commission expert panel have now raised concerns that a public-private partnership will actually result in worse outcomes for the state finances.

Given you signed a dud deal with the AFL and another dud deal with the federal government on the stadium, we would expect you to do it again with a private partner. Understanding the details of your planned private partnership will be critical for MPs to inform their vote on the project. Will you commit to tabling any private partnership agreement in parliament before any vote is taken on the stadium?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I will seek advice to the last part of the question. 
Why would we not want to engage in a good, strong public-private partnership as an opportunity? Why would we not explore that? There is nothing wrong with it. It is not Armageddon to want to encourage private investment in infrastructure. It happens everywhere else, and successfully so, in other states. Stop scaring people by throwing assertions out there as if the private sector is some big bad bogey person.

Dr Woodruff - We just want to know how much it is going to cost Tasmanians.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The conversations are simply taking up the Premier's time to answer the question, so it is up to you.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We will attract private investment. The Macquarie Point precinct is absolutely right for coupling public investment with private investment. That is the point of the stadium infrastructure, where the government can reach in, develop and build, with the potential support of the private sector, while also creating that enabler for other private businesses to go around the precinct. Hospitality venues would be one of those - like other states.

I do not know what you are so fixated on Macquarie Point, when it comes to not wanting to do anything with Macquarie Point. Let us just keep it there - sewage works are great.

Dr Woodruff - It is going to be over $1 billion.

Mr Behrakis- We do not mind those big plastic -

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens. Member for Clark, Mr Behrakis.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The sewage works are great. It is a fantastic tourist attraction. That is what you believe in - gravel - let us keep it there forever.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order. It is a serious question; it deserves a serious answer.

Mr Willie - It will be like the Devonport berth.

Mr ROCKLIFF - What was that, Mr Willie?

The SPEAKER - No, Premier, you do not get to ask for the interjections. I know you want to take up your 45 seconds, but could you just address the question or resume your seat? Mr Willie will stop helping.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We have been very transparent all along the way, and I cannot think of a project that has had such scrutiny -

Mr Bayley - It all says, 'Don't do it.'

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader of the Greens.

Mr ROCKLIFF - At the end of the day, it is a building wanting to create opportunity. Public Accounts Committees, questions in parliament over the last three years, other committees and opportunities for people to have their say as well - the most scrutinised project in history. We will continue along the road of getting this done, and I am committed to -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr BAYLEY - The Premier said there is nothing wrong with the public-private partnership, and we do not disagree, depending on the substance of that.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my right, I need to hear the supplementary.

Mr BAYLEY - The question was about tabling it. The Premier also said he would seek advice on tabling this. Can the Premier tell us when he will come back with advice about whether he will table the public-private agreement with any private entity in relation to the stadium?

The SPEAKER - Thank you, the time has expired. Premier, that is arising out of the answer that you gave.

Mr ROCKLIFF - When the information becomes available, and should we proceed down the public-private partnership path -

Dr Woodruff - Do not. It is going to cost $1.2 billion.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Mr ROCKLIFF - then of course we will be open with Tasmanian people about that. Why would we not?

Mr Bayley - You said you would seek advice on tabling the agreement.

Grange Resources - Increased Network Costs

Mr GARLAND question to MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

[10.30 a.m.]
Ben Saward is the commercial manager for Grange Resources, one of the state's largest mining companies, based in my electorate of Braddon. He gave evidence before the energy committee on 12 February this year. The transcript of this evidence is available online. At page 35, he said that TasNetworks advised Grange Resources their network costs would go up by 30 per cent to cover the cost of Marinus Link Stage 1. Is this correct? If so, will the network cost go up by a similar percentage for residential and small business customers to cover the cost of Marinus Link Stage 1?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question, noting that it is getting to the exciting and important time for the Marinus Link project, which I believe a lot of us in this room have been on the journey for. It is a very large and substantial investment for the state of Tasmania, and brings with it huge opportunity.

As in all large transmission buildouts, there is a cost to installing these things, but the future benefit for Tasmania is profound in my view. 

We will be doing the work. The government has committed to producing a whole-of-state business case to understand what the impacts of Marinus Link and the North West Transmission Developments are and potentially what mitigations would need to be contemplated through that process. As part of the work that we are doing, we are continuing to speak  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=5.9_C=0.73] with the Commonwealth government about its role. It is of course the [Bookmark: Phr3_O=38.0_D=12.7_C=0.73]  major shareholder in Marinus Link along with the Victorian government as well. What we have said, and I think the government and the former minister for Energy and Renewables have said, is that Marinus Link must be in the interests of Tasmania. 

That is an important tenet that we would - 

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=52.8_D=11.6_C=0.51] Mr Winter - Are you not sure if it is in Tasmanians' best interest after 12 years?

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=66.5_D=0.3_C=0.33] Mr DUIGAN - I noticed Mr Winter has already said that he would be up there selling his part of Marinus Link as part of his privatisation agenda. He would like to sell that off.

Members interjecting.

Ms Finlay - You are not taking it seriously.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=81.5_D=0.6_C=0.20] The SPEAKER - Members on my left.  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=84.2_D=2.4_C=0.72] I am taking it seriously and I am taking the point of [Bookmark: Phr9_O=87.0_D=18.0_C=0.73]  order from Mr Garland, which I believe will be relevance. I will take the point of order. The minister will be relevant to the question asked.

Mr GARLAND - Minister, just answer the question. Is this correct, and can residential and small business -

The SPEAKER - I am happy that relevance applies. The minister will draw himself to the question, please. 

Mr DUIGAN - Transmission impact is one aspect of the Marinus Link proposal. That is one side of the question. What we need to do as a government is understand the totality of it. We are doing the work to understand and know, as we progress toward a final investment decision on behalf of the state of Tasmania, what those impacts are and what the benefits are. We believe there are substantial benefits  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=131.6_D=20.7_C=0.67] to this project and that is why we are pursuing it. It is about energy security for our state, it is about jobs and it is about making the best and highest use of our very important Hydro asset. 

The SPEAKER - The member's time has expired. I am not surprised that I am getting a supplementary from Mr Garland. 

Supplementary Question

Mr GARLAND - The question was: is this correct,  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=153.3_D=17.2_C=0.77] and, if so, what percentage for residential and small business customers? Will their power prices go up to cover the cost of Marinus Link Stage 1?

The SPEAKER - The question is in order. It was the original question and I draw the minister to it. Ministers have taken a habit of not listening to me when I say relevance.  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=170.8_D=25.3_C=0.78] If I am asking you to be relevant, I want you to be relevant to the question. It is actually a ruling.

Mr DUIGAN - Thank you, Speaker. The information around projected impacts is covered off by the AER. In November 2024, Marinus Link Pty Ltd submitted its construction phase revenue proposal to the AER. The submission shows a forecast increase of cost to 17 per cent, or $3.86 billion, for Stage 1. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=197.2_D=2.5_C=0.63] 

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=200.4_D=29.6_C=0.84] Updated customer benefit analysis from FDI Consulting included in the submission shows that, on average, when you take on the one hand the transmission cost and on the other hand the wholesale energy cost, a typical household in both Tasmania or Victoria will save between $25 and $36 dollars every year accounting for network costs.

Department of State Growth - Jobs - Workforce Renewal Incentive Program

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.36 a.m.]
In an earlier answer, you referred to redundancy payments in the Department of State Growth as 'workforce renewal incentives' and outlined that these cuts will be put in place across the public service. Given there is a hiring freeze now in place, how are these positions going to be replaced? If they are going to be replaced despite a hiring freeze policy, how will that save any money?  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=265.1_D=2.2_C=0.72] Is this just a redundancy program by another name?

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=268.2_D=3.3_C=0.46]  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=272.7_D=20.6_C=0.65] ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. It has taken you a little while, but I think Dave Killick wrote an article on this on 12 February this year about workplace matters - WRIPs (Workforce Renewal Incentive Program), as we call them - so you are a bit late to the party and you are scaring people again.

Mr Winter - You are actually doing it.

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=294.9_D=10.0_C=0.78] You are ignoring the facts. There have always been tools available to State Service agencies. Our government and former governments - in fact, the last Labor-Greens government paid out 554 voluntary redundancies and over 1000 WRIPs.

Mr Ellis - 1000?

Mr Jaensch - Big Ripper.

Mr ROCKLIFF - WRIPs are also voluntary. We have only made two changes. One I have already referred is increasing the payment from $30,000 to $60,000 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=26.1_D=6.6_C=0.76] . The value of WRIPs was outdated because the $30,000 has been there for some time: as long as I can remember [Bookmark: Phr3_O=33.1_D=24.5_C=0.78]  being in government anyway. The other change has been an extension to the period to fill a re-profiled role from six to eight months to allow for additional time for recruitment.

WRIPs are only open to permanent State Service employees through an expression of interest process, which is not binding on the employee. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=58.5_D=4.6_C=0.78]  Each expression of interest is assessed against the business requirements of the agency and considered on its merits [Bookmark: Phr5_O=63.6_D=30.0_C=0.73] , and agencies must fund the payment to employees. The Workplace Renewal Incentive Program allows employees to leave the State Service earlier than they may have planned, for example, if they are close to retirement age. A WRIP will not create a long-term vacancy as the position is not abolished, but it is re-profiled and someone else will come into that role. 

It is a mechanism that has been used by our government and by the Labor-Greens government between 2010 and 2014, triggering for that period for forestry workers and nurses, power bills going up 65 per cent. In the interest of not making it triggering for people, I will resist the temptation of reminding [Bookmark: Phr7_O=122.7_D=1.5_C=0.88]  people how bad it was [Bookmark: Phr8_O=124.8_D=25.8_C=0.61]  when you lot were in government, when you were also utilising the Workplace Renewal Incentive Program, as we are sensibly doing. 

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question and remind the Premier that 'you lot' in reference to me is through the Chair, so do be careful in your language.

Mr ROCKLIFF - My apologies, honourable Speaker.

Mr WINTER - Arising from the Premier's answer, I note that the Minister for Community Services interjected and said 'Ripper' when he was talking about the cuts to the public service. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=151.4_D=8.4_C=0.62]   
Premier, will there be a record kept of roles in which you pay redundancies, or workforce renewal incentives as you prefer it, and will you make that public?

The SPEAKER - I draw the Premier to the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=162.0_D=1.2_C=0.43]  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=167.6_D=22.2_C=0.74] These are good questions for the open and transparent process of Budget Estimates, where you can ask these questions of detail to each secretary and minister before you. However, records will be kept. 


Macquarie Point Stadium - Tasmanian Planning Commission Assessment -Legal Advice

Ms BURNET question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=195.6_D=29.6_C=0.87] [10.40 a.m.]
The experts undertaking the stadium assessment have been carefully considering relevant matters for nearly 18 months. However, less than three days after publishing their scathing report, you released legal advice saying it should be chucked in the bin. Your mainland lawyers claim they know more than the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) panel members about Tasmanian law than a former assistant solicitor-general and have a better grasp of economic matters than a former boss of the Treasury department. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=225.7_D=18.5_C=0.89]  Apparently, that legal advice, put together in just three days and three pages long, has been able to undermine the planning commission's extensive and lengthy considerations. 

This exact argument was already made by the Macquarie Point Development Corporation to the planning commission months ago. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=245.2_D=13.0_C=0.81]  Back then it was comprehensively rejected. Given all this, will you admit this so-called legal advice is just a cooked-up pretence to help you justify your move towards special approval legislation? 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, members on my right.

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=269.1_D=5.8_C=0.75] Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. As I understand it, you voted against the POSS order [Bookmark: Phr17_O=276.3_D=10.5_C=0.50] . Whatever mechanism there is, you will never ever support it.

Dr Woodruff - It is a sub-standard planning process.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The Leader of the Greens will stop interjecting, discussing matters with Mr Willie and the Premier will direct his answers through the Chair.

Mr ROCKLIFF -I said I was perplexed by the issues paper, and why would I not be when you consider it was pouring cold water on the fact that a stadium would create aspiration for our young people? The investment in the JackJumpers and the MyState Arena significantly counters that across the state. 

The matters about - what are those pesky things called? Oh, pedestrians. They raised the challenge with pedestrians in the issues paper -

Dr Woodruff - It is an integrated assessment.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Mr ROCKLIFF - where we had 30,000 people come here to the Christmas pageant. It all happened beautifully; no problem. If we took some of those matters to hand, we would be cancelling the Anzac Day march down Macquarie Street.

Mr Abetz – That is right. The Greens would like that.

Ms Ogilvie - Good day.

The SPEAKER - Minister Abetz and minister Ogilvie can stop helping the Premier. He is doing fine on his own.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The point about pedestrians is: is that not great? Is that not what we want?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my right. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - We are building stadia infrastructure so people can come and see the Devils play. That is exactly what we want; to create an economy. They manage at the Australian Open, the MCG and everywhere else around the country. Yes, it might require some police resources from time to time to manage the traffic and pedestrian access. That is normal. This is why the issues paper was perplexing and bordering on concerning as well. 

The Macquarie Point Development Corporation is well within its rights on the legal matters it presented.

I support the process of submissions to 8 May. We are in the Project of State Significance process right now. I have been very open and transparent about the enabling legislation because we have a very strict timeline. We have to get this done. Also, the parliament will have their say -

The SPEAKER - The member's time has expired. 

Supplementary Question

The SPEAKER - I am hearing a supplementary from the member for Clark.

Ms BURNET - Honourable Speaker, it goes to the Premier's answer to the question. Was it not the government that set the parameters for the issue paper for the Tasmanian Planning Commission Panel to consider?

The SPEAKER - I am happy to allow that as a supplementary. It is almost a new question, but the Premier did refer to that process and seems happy to answer it.

Mr Bayley - You tabled the POSS order.

The SPEAKER - Deputy leader, that is not your question and you can stop helping.

Mr ROCKLIFF - There was nothing there about the economic benefits of this project, the extent of the opportunity around the economics.

Dr Woodruff - That is not true.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Well, there was a lot of negative in the issues and not looking at the overall benefits. 

Also, irrespective of the Project of State Significance process or enabling legislation process - which, of course, we are considering - parliament will have its say.

Dr Woodruff - It is not the question.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It is the question because both Houses of parliament in a democracy will have their say. I will not get any more votes than you, Dr Woodruff. I will have one vote and you will have one vote.

Dr Woodruff - Just answer the question.

The SPEAKER - The time to answer the question has expired. The Leader of the Greens will stop interjecting.


Education - Redundancies

Ms DOW question to MINISTER for EDUCATION, Ms PALMER

[10.46 a.m.]
Can you confirm that the Department of Education, Children and Young People (DECYP) has added a new deputy secretary position with responsibility for HR? Is this position responsible for implementing your $60,000 redundancy program in the department of Education? 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I am not aware of a new position being created. I will look into that and come back to the House.
We have an incredible team at DECYP led by a wonderful acting secretary at the moment. There are changes afoot as there are in every other department, and I have a secretary who will work through that situation with the kindness that she does in every aspect of her work. I am not aware of a position that has been created, but I will certainly take it on notice and get back to you.

Supplementary Question

Ms DOW - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary but the member has taken it on notice.

Ms DOW - She has, but we would like to understand how many positions are going to be cut.

The SPEAKER - That was not part of the original question. The minister may add that to her answer if she chooses, but it was not part of the original question. 


Macquarie Point Stadium - Tasmanian Planning Commission Assessment -Legal Advice

Mr BAYLEY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.48 a.m.]
Who made the decision to engage a law firm for advice about the Planning Commission report? When was the firm engaged and under what terms?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. The best advice that I have is that it was the Macquarie Point Development Corporation. As to the second part of the question, I am happy to seek that advice for you.

The SPEAKER - I note that has also been taken on notice. I did note the upper House members leaving a little early. I call the member for Braddon. If Mrs Beswick's question was to one of those ministers, then they would have had to be here to answer it. Thankfully, it is not.


Port of Devonport - 24/7 Berth Works

Mrs BESWICK question to MINISTER for TRANSPORT, Mr ABETZ

[10.48 a.m.]
The race is on to complete the Devonport berths and the two new Spirit of Tasmania vessels so the state avoids further costly delays. To catch up, the project is about to start a 24-hour work schedule. Residents have been warned about the potential for drilling at all hours of the day and night. How confident are you that these works will not cause significant noise disruption to nearby residents, and is it possible that complaints could trigger more delays?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question and share her excitement with the developments that are going on at Devonport, berth 3. Things are well and truly underway. First, we had criticism that things were not happening, and now there are elements in the community complaining that things are happening. If you want a berth there, there will be the requirement of pile driving, et cetera. Believe it or not, that creates noise. That is part and parcel of the excitement of delivering Spirits IV and V to Devonport.

As I understand it, the EPA (Environment Protection Authority) and other authorities determine the noise levels that are acceptable. I understand the contractors - I think it was a letter box drop, I am not sure - consulted in the local area to advise that there will be noise emanating from the works. I am hopeful that the people will accept that some noise is part of the price to pay for the delivery of berth 3. It is always one of those things, balancing those considerations.

I would like to think that most people would see the inconvenience of the noise at the moment is something that they will be able to look back on and say, 'Well, that was a short-term inconvenience for a huge, long-term benefit for the Tasmanian economy, be it for our producers, be it for our tourist sector and just for social interaction between families getting across Bass Strait.' 

Will there be noise? Yes, there will. The contractor will try to minimise that as much as possible and we hope that the noise will be as short as possible, keeping in mind we want to get that berth built. We will get it built and we look forward to Spirit IV and Spirit V coming into the Mersey River and being able to berth at the place where they are currently drilling and driving piles to ensure that there is a safe berth.


Tasmania Police - Hiring Freeze and Tough-On-Crime Policies

Mr JENNER question to MINISTER for POLICE, FIRE and EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Mr ELLIS

[10.52 a.m.]
Your government has committed to a tough-on-crime approach, introducing measures to enable police to apprehend offenders more effectively. However, at the same time, you have implemented a job freeze, leaving police and other personnel responsible for processing the detainees understaffed. This has resulted in a significant backlog and extended wait times in those already overburdened systems. Given these challenges, how do you justify the two policies coexisting, and what steps will you take to prevent the system from becoming entirely overwhelmed?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for Lyons for his questions. Let me dispel some myths. I was at the recruitment graduation that we had at the academy on Friday, which was such an exciting day for all those fine Tasmanian men and women. We can confirm that, as of Friday, we have a new record number of Tasmanian police on our books. That is a wonderful thing. Even more than that, it was so exciting to see 70 recruits across the parade grounds. Not only do we have a record number of police in Tasmania as we speak, but we also have a record recruitment blitz underway.

Tasmania is the only jurisdiction in the country that is consistently filling all of our recruitment books because Tasmania Police are Australia's most trusted. The latest report on government services show that Tasmania Police have the highest levels of satisfaction of any jurisdiction in the country. They have the highest levels of integrity, as judged by the community and, of course, Tasmania has the highest investment in policing services of any state in Australia.

That is really encouraging. It is a wonderful thing that we continue to invest in police, and that is the difference between this side of the House and the other. When they were in government, Mr Jenner, they sacked one in ten police officers in Tasmania - 108 officers. We have rebuilt Tasmania Police and we have gone so much further - an increase of more than 30 per cent of police officers in Tasmania, record recruitment. We even had to put money in the budget recently to upgrade the police academy because we had so many people coming through it. That is a good thing, and we are continuing to invest.

In your electorate, Mr Jenner, there is a new emergency services hub, including police at Sorell. There is a new station at New Norfolk. There is a new regional headquarters in Longford. There are also upgrades currently underway at the Bridgewater station and the St Helens station. Our continued investment in country relief staffing is helping us to back in country police officers right around the beautiful electorate of Lyons and around our state as well.

Our government makes no apologies for being tough on crime. We know that we need to be tough on crime and the causes of crime. That is why we invest so heavily in police in this state. That is why, when we look at being efficient and delivering great outcomes from the department, we grow our front line and we look to where we can make savings at the back end: things like consolidating our CBD leases for office staff here in Hobart so that we are using the taxpayers' money more efficiently. Those are the kind of strategies that we develop as opposed to those on the other side of the House, Mr Jenner, who sacked 108 police officers when they were last in government.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, members on my left. 

Supplementary Question

Mr JENNER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr JENNER - It was mainly about steps to prevent the system from becoming overwhelmed, and it is not about the police officers - I appreciate we have more police officers - but what we class as non-essential civilians that the job freeze actually looks at. I am wondering what we are doing for that because they are the people who obviously have to do the paperwork.

The SPEAKER - I will call the minister as that does relate to the original question.

Mr ELLIS - As I mentioned previously, our focus has been investing in the front line and it is really paying dividends. That is the kind of investment that we want to deliver. We are working through this process, just as we are in every other department, but our focus has been really strong on how we can grow Tasmania Police; continue to grow the front line; deliver our election commitments of an additional sixty officers, including dedicated strike forces to act against crime in our larger communities and across the state. 

Of course, we will be efficient in Tasmania Police, we will be efficient in the Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management and we will be efficient across government because the Tasmanian people expect us to be wise stewards of the Tasmanian people's money.

I note your commentary the other day, Mr Jenner, about the importance of responsible budget management. I believe you would expect nothing less of us as well.


State Service Redundancies - Workforce Renewal Incentives - Cost

Mr WILLIE question to TREASURER, Mr BARNETT

[10.57 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=8.9_D=2.1_C=0.36] Documents released under Right to Information reveal there is no budget this year or in any year of the forward Estimates for your doubled Workforce Renewal Incentives. Is your plan to fix the budget crisis really a large number of unbudgeted redundancies in Health, Education, and other agencies? How much will this attack on Tasmanian jobs cost?

ANSWER
 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=39.5_D=0.5_C=0.37]  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=46.0_D=24.0_C=0.82] 
Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. On this side of the House, we have a plan called the 2030 Strong Plan. We are still waiting for your alternative budget. It has only been 11 years, so you have a chance on 29  May, Mr Willie. We look forward to that. 

As the Premier outlined, part of the plan is cutting red tape [Bookmark: Phr6_O=70.9_D=8.6_C=0.72] , building a stronger economy, right-sizing the public service and the Workplace Renewal Incentive Program. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=79.7_D=29.3_C=0.80]  You are a little bit late to the party. That process commenced in about February this year. It doubled what was a $30,000 incentive to $60,000. It is on the public record that it has been in place since February. It is the same program that occurred under the Labor-Greens government [Bookmark: Phr8_O=109.2_D=29.9_C=0.81] . This government will get on with the job. We want a right size for the public service because it has increased some 18 per cent in the last five years while the population has increased 5 per cent. 

This is part of our plan in terms of our Budget, which has a pathway to surplus by 2029-30. You can see more and say more from 29 May [Bookmark: Phr9_O=139.3_D=20.0_C=0.63] , when I will be pleased and proud to deliver on that commitment.

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - My question was that this is unbudgeted. How much will the Workforce Renewal Incentive Plan cost? 

The SPEAKER - I will call the Treasurer to that as it was the original question.

Mr BARNETT - [Bookmark: Phr10_O=161.2_D=24.5_C=0.83]  I do not think the shadow treasurer was listening to the Premier when he said that each expression of interest is assessed against business requirements of the agency and considered on its merits. Agencies must fund the payment to employees. 


Cybersecurity - Potential Breaches Due to Redundancies

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=191.6_D=2.3_C=0.31]  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=194.0_D=1.4_C=0.62] Mr WILLIE question to TREASURER, Mr BARNETT 

[11.01 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=197.4_D=25.6_C=0.74] Understaffing the public service leads to bad outcomes for Tasmanians. Over the weekend, Tasmanians read about the cybersecurity breach in the Tasmanian Gambling Exclusion Scheme. Can you confirm the Department of Treasury and Finance currently has just one cybersecurity officer? How many more incidents like this will occur as a result of your unbudgeted redundancies in Health, Education and other departments?

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=223.3_D=0.6_C=0.25]  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=234.0_D=24.4_C=0.81] Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question and his interest in this matter. With respect to the cybersecurity incident, Treasury has taken this very seriously. They have had an investigation. They put out a public release on Friday. I wrote to every member of parliament in both [Bookmark: Phr17_O=258.8_D=30.0_C=0.87]  Chambers to offer that briefing from Treasury. We take it seriously and those investigations are ongoing. 

You referenced the hiring freeze and the management of our public service. We appreciate the work of the public service. However, as the Premier and I have made clear, we want it to deliver the best [Bookmark: Phr18_O=288.9_D=14.6_C=0.83]  services possible. These are the services we are backing. It is not just the right size; it needs to be the right shape and delivering the right services that are in the best interests of all Tasmanians [Bookmark: Phr19_O=303.6_D=1.3_C=0.90] . It is right that we consider the efficiency and productivity of our public service. The Premier announced more of our plans for this state in the state of the state address and we are getting on with the job of delivering on that. This is in stark contrast  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.8_D=4.8_C=0.53] to the sacking of nurses under the Labor-Greens government -

Mr WILLIE - Honourable Speaker, point of order, Standing Order 45, relevance.

Mr Abetz - Standing order for a glass jaw.

Mr WILLIE - My question was how many more of these incidents will occur from understaffing in cybersecurity?
The SPEAKER - That was the original question. I will draw the Treasurer to it and I do not need Mr Abetz helping me to do so. 

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=46.3_D=20.9_C=0.82] Mr BARNETT - We take this very seriously as a government. I have outlined exactly how seriously Treasury has taken this. An investigation started last week into protecting its information and ICT systems from malicious cyber activity [Bookmark: Phr5_O=67.4_D=16.2_C=0.83]  and supporting Tasmanians who have been impacted by cyber attacks. This is a priority of our government. We stand behind that. The government provided $4.9 million over four years through the whole-of-government cybersecurity uplift program [Bookmark: Phr6_O=84.0_D=16.7_C=0.79]  in the 2021 budget with the purpose of ensuring the resilience of government services in the face of increasing cyber threats. This is not new to Tasmania. We are aware of this, we are working on it,  monitoring it and dealing with it incredibly seriously.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=100.8_D=28.7_C=0.71] A further $3.3 million has been committed to bolster our cyber defences through the Cyber Hubs Initiative, which will establish an improved whole-of-government cybersecurity operating model. We take it seriously and we are getting on with the job. 

Supplementary Question

Mr WILLIE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WILLIE - Can the Treasurer confirm that there is only one cybersecurity officer in the Department of Treasury and Finance?

The SPEAKER - Treasurer, it was quite a specific question, which is unusual in Question Time, so that question is in order.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=130.4_D=15.6_C=0.82] Mr BARNETT - We take it very seriously, Treasury has acted on it, I have had directed discussions with the secretary with respect to the specificity of that question. I will take it on notice.

CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Health - Four-Week Wait for Cancer Biopsy

Ms JOHNSTON question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

[11.04 a.m.]
My question is on behalf of a constituent in Glenorchy. His mother has just been diagnosed with lung cancer, but she has been told she has a wait of approximately four weeks for a biopsy to determine the appropriate treatment course. Worse still, she faced a lengthy wait for results after that due to chronic understaffing in pathology services.  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=180.8_D=25.8_C=0.69] The Australian Medical Association (AMA) also recently raised concerns about this publicly. 

Minister, you would understand that with aggressive cancers, every day matters and she is facing an unacceptable delay in receiving treatment. How is this acceptable? What are you doing to urgently address the pathology backlog or is my constituent's mother a casualty of your government's vacancy freeze and failure to manage the state's finance responsibly?


Huon Highway-Mountain River Road Intersection Sa [Bookmark: Phr11_O=207.5_D=1.2_C=0.21]  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=209.6_D=29.8_C=0.70] fety Plans

Mr STREET question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE, Mr VINCENT

Following the decision by the Independent Transport Commissioner to lower the speed limit on the Huon Highway through the intersection with Mountain River Road, Grove, the Tasmanian Liberal government was re-elected with a policy to contribute $3 million towards infrastructure safety treatment at the same intersection. Can the minister provide an update on these improvements for the Huon Valley community? 


Howick-Wellington Street Intersection - Driver and Pedestrian Safety

Ms FINLAY question to MINISTER for TRANSPORT, Mr ABETZ

Andrew from St Leonards has asked when  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=239.6_D=30.0_C=0.80] the government will look at installing arrows to allow traffic to safely turn at the Howick and Wellington streets intersection in Launceston. He says this busy intersection previously had the third highest number of traffic accidents in Launceston and the number is increasing. He says that due to the increasing volume of traffic here, the only way to turn right is to illegally run the red light. He says there have been accidents that have resulted in cars hitting the signs on the footpath and it is only a matter of time before a pedestrian is hit. The safety of drivers and pedestrians should be considered [Bookmark: Phr14_O=269.9_D=27.4_C=0.70]  to make a change in the light system. When will the government look at doing something here?


Diseased Salmon and Human Consumption

Dr WOODRUFF question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

My question is from my constituent Alison and is about public health. Alison says tetracyclines are a category D drug that are contraindicated during pregnancy, with potential for bone density loss and tooth discoloration in foetuses and children under eight. We now know that diseased salmon that have been treated with  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=297.9_D=6.9_C=0.63] oxytetracycline are being eaten by humans. Have these salmon undergone a withdrawal period to ensure there is no antibiotic residue? If so, for how long? If not, has the government undertaken testing to confirm that the diseased salmon is safe for consumption for pregnant women and children? If so, can you please make that information public?


Tamar River - New Bridge

Mr FAIRS question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE, Mr VINCENT

A constituent for my electorate of Bass, Mark, is a regular driver to Hobart. He tells me he is stoked that the Bridgewater bridge is nearing completion on time and budget, and is equally as excited for what a new bridge on the River Tamar in Launceston would do for the city. Can the minister please advise of any early feedback on the recently released bridge options and outline what the next steps are?


Red Tape Around Building a Home in Tasmania

Ms BUTLER question to MINISTER for HOUSING, PLANNING and CONSUMER AFFAIRS, Mr ELLIS

I ask my question on behalf of Brendan, an owner-builder and new resident of Tasmania who has recently moved from New South Wales and is currently building a new home for his family in Lyons. He would like to know why there are so many extra charges required to be an owner-builder in Tasmania compared to New South Wales. He says higher costs and charges in Tasmania compared to New South Wales include stamp duty; extra cost to get a compulsory BAL rating; compulsory building design costs, instead of being able to do your own building plans in New South Wales; solar panel installation tax and expensive owner-builder permits.

He says he needs to plan for 20 per cent more in extra fees and charges, which includes paying for private-sector consultants to satisfy the requirements of the Tasmanian Planning Act, than is required to build the same house in New South Wales. Why is there so much red tape to build your own home in Tasmania?


Government Disclosure of Information from Encrypted Messaging Apps

Mr GARLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

My question comes from a constituent who wants to know if any state government departments have disclosed any information that originates from encrypted messaging apps used by ministers or their staff in response to a Right to Information request in the last 12 months? If the answer is yes, please provide the total number of disclosures made which contained information retrieved from an encrypted messaging app used by a state government minister or their staff.

TABLED PAPER

Hospitals Non-Standard Items List

[11.10 a.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, in Question Time today, I referred to a document from the Department of Health and I seek to table that document.

Paper tabled.


MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Global Economic Shocks

[11.11 a.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House take note of the following matter: global economic shocks.

It is my pleasure to rise to move this matter of public importance into global economic shocks. I think many Australians and Tasmanians are looking at the world in disbelief at the moment with significant changes in the global order and a significant day for the ASX yesterday with more than 4 per cent being wiped off the ASX, wiping around $1 billion of value.

The last time that that has occurred to such a significant degree was during the pandemic. There was another occasion during the GFC, and another occasion in 1987 with the stock market crash. We are talking about a significant issue in the global economy, driven by the United States president and policy settings. There are significant trade tensions across the globe, and it is very concerning the world order is being thrown out.

We are seeing retaliation tariffs being implemented and effectively trade wars, which is going to have a significant impact across the globe and in Tasmania. Yesterday, we saw China impose a 34 per cent tariff on all United States imports, for example. There is talk now of a double rate cut and a potential recession, which is deeply concerning for Tasmania. The question is whether we are prepared. Do we have a premier and ministers who are up to the job?

We have been raising concerns in this place over the last few weeks about our major industrials which contribute billions of dollars to the Tasmanian economy. In some cases, they have been in existence for over 100 years. Collectively, they directly support hundreds if not thousands of jobs , and definitely thousands of jobs indirectly across the Tasmanian economy, supporting hundreds and hundreds of small businesses. What can our state government do to assist them? We have to make sure that we have the right state government support, and one of the biggest inputs in those businesses is energy costs. We know for a fact that energy costs are going up for those major industrials in this global economy with all of this uncertainty. It is problematic, and it is a direct setting of this government.

Not only that, we have the proposal now for thousands of job cuts across the public service. They call it 'right-sizing' the public service. That is just code for 'cuts.' They are going to cut the public service in this uncertainty. The question I would pose to the Treasurer is: if we are heading into these uncertain economic times, is it a sensible policy to be cutting jobs in the Tasmanian economy and ripping away services? The government can try and dress this up however they like, but when you cut jobs in the public service there are less people to do the work. We know that their policy of a blanket hiring freeze and vacancy control is a very inefficient and lazy policy. The efficiency dividend they are imposing on the public service is outsourcing the problem to unelected bureaucrats. 

Rather than owning the problem themselves, they are handing it over to unelected bureaucrats to make decisions that are not strategic. Decisions are pushed down the line, and different managers within the public service are looking for savings within their unit. It creates inefficiencies. It creates inefficient service delivery for Tasmania. It is a lazy policy.

How did we end up here? We all know that this government has not been able to manage the state's finances. We have the worst finances in the state's history, and we have had the biggest deficits in the state's history in the past two years. The former treasurer over there predicted a surplus for the biggest deficit in the state's history three years prior to that occurring. That is how quickly it has gone south of them.

We know that they are totally misguided in their response. They are trying to address problems that they have caused through job cuts in the public service, and through a privatisation agenda that they did not seek a mandate for and that has no pathway through this parliament. This is a government that is in complete inertia. They have been in denial for so long. These problems are now coming home to roost.

Time expired.

[11.16 a.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Deputy Premier) - Deputy Speaker, I am very pleased to speak on this important matter of global economic shocks and to indicate that Tasmanians can be assured of a safe pair of hands in the Rockliff Liberal government.

I wanted to make it very clear that this is all part of state Labor's scare campaign. They are creating uncertainty on the back of months and years of relentless negativity, not doing the hard work, the hard yards of delivering an alternative budget. Not one costed policy has ever been delivered in more than 11 years by state Labor and it is time they stepped up. They will have that opportunity on 29 May or shortly thereafter.

We are absolutely focused on delivering a stronger economy under our 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future, and this has been recognised only recently with the National Australia Bank business survey, which showed Tasmania leading the nation - number one for business confidence; number two for business conditions.

Mr Willie - All the other reports are damning.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr Willie, you were heard in silence.

Mr BARNETT - I hear Mr Willie, my shadow, questioning that. Mr Willie may not be aware of a more recent survey, which was the State Economic Scorecard 2025 from the Institute of Public Affairs that was just released. It had Tasmania number one for state economic growth and GSP per capita, and Tasmania at number one for real wages growth and productivity growth. How about that? I am pleased and proud of that. I have only learnt about that in very recent times, and this should surely put paid to state Labor's relentless negativity.

The Premier has made it clear that we have a strong plan; he announced that with the State of the State address. We are delivering on that, cutting the red tape, streamlining the processes, backing business and backing industry. Our GBE reform plans are well and truly underway.

We have delivered our package of draft legislation in recent weeks. Consultation is occurring with not only the GBEs but the business and industry leaders around Tasmania. We are getting on with the job and we are delivering, but there is a lot more to do. It is hard. There have been and there are global economic shocks. That is why I have been in touch with my Treasury secretary and the TASCORP chair with regard to ensuring that level of confidence remains, and it does with TASCORP. They deal in the bond market primarily, not in equities. There has been a considerable up and down in the recent week with respect to equities across the globe, including in Australia. 

That confidence remains in terms of managing the process. The Premier acted very swiftly in response to the global economic shocks and President Trump's tariff increases by announcing that he would swiftly organise a roundtable with business and industry players. I talked with the Premier about that this morning and it is all set ready to have that roundtable, and that is excellent news. 

You made reference to the key business players and the major industrials. They will be engaged, as they have been in the past. We work with them closely. They are a very important part of our economy, employing Tasmanians across the board, and we are pleased and proud of their contribution. 

The Minister for Business, Industry and Resources, The Minister for Energy and Renewables, I as Treasurer, and the Premier have ongoing liaison with those key players and others. The Premier has written to the Prime Minister about Nyrstar and seeking the Australian Government's involvement. Our government will work closely with the federal government and indeed the Leader of the Opposition with respect to the global economic shocks that are there.

Time expired.

[11.21 a.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak on the matter of public importance of global economic shocks, and I begin by acknowledging that the global economic context is important. We might be a small island at the bottom of the world, but what happens in the world impacts us here. What we do in Tasmania is impacted by global events and policies and decisions. We cannot control those things, but there are things that we can control, and those things that we can control, we need to make sure that we are doing well.

There is no room for poor economic decision-making in Tasmania and yet that is what we are looking at right now with the stadium. It is a terrible project that does not stack up economically. The Treasurer has just talked about being a safe pair of hands for the Tasmanian economy and yet we have multiple economist reports that say the stadium does not stack up economically. 

I can tell you that my constituents [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=29.4_C=0.80]  in Bass are very worried about this stadium. They know it is bad economic news for them and they do not want it. That is why scrutiny is so important. All of us in this place have a responsibility to be evaluating the stadium and making sure that it is properly assessed and evaluated and yet we have a Labor opposition who are stepping back from their responsibility to scrutinise this critical economic investment [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.0_D=7.3_C=0.78]  that is proposed for our state. The Labor Party have shifted positions multiple times in relation to this stadium. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=67.9_D=29.4_C=0.82]  First they were against it, and I know many people who have 'no stadium' stickers that they obtained from Labor offices. Then they moved to another position and the former leader of Labor, Rebecca White, said that they would renegotiate the deal on the stadium. They would renegotiate with the AFL. Again, still a position of 'no stadium.' 

Then they moved to a third position, which was one that the current leader of Labor, Mr Winter [Bookmark: Phr5_O=97.9_D=29.7_C=0.80] , has put forward, which was that they promised to scrutinise the stadium and to ensure that the cap on the investment by the Liberal government was not exceeded, but that the cap was stuck to. Yet now we have a fourth position that is being put forward by Labor. I am not talking about their position of unconditional support. I have an email here from Ms Haddad to a constituent that outlines quite [Bookmark: Phr6_O=127.7_D=13.7_C=0.84]  a different position by Labor:

We have said that we need to consider other options. There are at least two other stadium proposals on the table because Macquarie Point just won't work. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=142.6_D=15.0_C=0.92]  Our support is not for Macquarie Point, it is for a stadium, given we want the teams. The government needs to remain open to the other proposals and work with Tasmanians on something that is deliverable [Bookmark: Phr8_O=157.7_D=17.1_C=0.88]  and affordable. 

We have here yet another position from Labor in which they recognise that the current proposal for Macquarie Point Stadium does not stack up [Bookmark: Phr9_O=175.0_D=22.7_C=0.88]  and they want a different stadium, another stadium. Yet again we have another position from Labor. They are not doing their job of scrutiny. They are not doing their job of being in opposition. They know Macquarie Point will not work. They want a different stadium and they know that this is undeliverable and unaffordable. The Macquarie Point Stadium will not work for Tasmania.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=199.3_D=30.0_C=0.88] We do have another stadium that is already available, that is already funded - the upgrades are already funded and it makes great economic sense. That is the York Park Stadium in Launceston. It is known to be a beautiful playing surface. It is already funded. The upgrades to the tune of $130 million are already funded. They are not going to take our state further into debt because the money is already there.

I would like to finish today by reminding [Bookmark: Phr11_O=229.4_D=27.8_C=0.91]  all of us in this place that we already have that suitable stadium for AFL in Tasmania already funded. It will not take us further into debt. We cannot afford to go further into debt. We want a team in Tasmania playing at York Park because that will be good for the state. When the world is facing enormous global economic uncertainty we need to make sure that we are making wise decisions.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=259.1_D=2.6_C=0.52] [11.26 a.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass) -  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=264.8_D=15.3_C=0.90] Deputy Speaker, I rise this morning to speak on this matter of public importance about global shocks at the moment in the economy. It is known well and impacts are being felt right across nations across the world from the changes and challenges that are occurring [Bookmark: Phr15_O=280.2_D=15.9_C=0.88] . Our incredible state of Tasmania, buoyed by great businesses and great industry, is not shielded or sheltered from that. There will be impacts in Tasmania. It is imperative that this place, that us as opposition and the government [Bookmark: Phr16_O=296.4_D=8.5_C=0.86]  work to ensure that Tasmania is best prepared for the shocks that will arrive. Often, in Tasmania, there is a lag of impacts and unfortunately, when they arrive, they come hard and they tail out long. It is essential that this government do all they can to support industry, businesses, families and individuals in this state from that shock when it arrives.

I acknowledge that the Premier recently did act swiftly in response to the trade tensions coming out of the United States, particularly where it impacted our primary industries. I look forward to hearing the outcomes of the roundtables. However, there is no doubt and no question that there are things that this government could be doing and must be doing now to ensure that we support the economy of Tasmania in the wake of the impacts that will come. We know that it is often beyond the capacity of this government to understand and act on that. We have heard repeatedly over recent weeks about the impacts on our major industrials and our large businesses in Tasmania, around the impacts of energy prices, particularly with transmission costs. There are levers that this government can pull to support Tasmanian businesses that they refuse to be honest about and that they refuse to accept and understand their role within.

We know that the struggles for many with power prices are real, whether they be in a household or a business. It impacts individuals, families, small businesses, large businesses, and our major industrials . When this government do not do what they can to protect them from those impacts, it impacts our economy - not only in terms of the financial impact, but also on jobs, and that impacts the families of Tasmania.

Where you have a minister, particularly the Energy minister, who, after repeated questions in his portfolio area in his electorate about major industrials that are being impacted by massive increases in transmission prices, still now continues to maintain that the impacts and the increases that we know are real are not real, you cannot expect Tasmanian businesses to trust this government. We have on record the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry saying that it is going to be difficult for Tasmanian businesses and Tasmanians to continue to trust this government.

We have just had the Treasurer on his feet talking about assuring the Tasmanian people, trusting this government, being proud of the position that this government is in. This government single-handedly have taken Tasmania into the worst debt and the worst deficits that we have seen. As many people have commented, including Saul Eslake, much of that is at the feet of this government just in recent years.

This government comes to their feet repeatedly and talk about the impacts of the pandemic, and speak softly and quietly and emotionally about the great work that we had to do at that time, implying that the financial circumstances of the state and our finances, and the economy are somehow due to the pandemic that we all experienced. However, we know that things were on the slide before the pandemic arrived. There was the position that people in Tasmania supported around the pandemic, but since then, in the three years to date under the leadership of this Premier, it is just getting worse. Not only are the finances in a poor position, not only are ministers in poor positions where they are not being honest with our community, but we know that projects are in a poor position.

How can we trust this government to prepare us for these global shocks when they cannot even do the basics? If you are going to build a ship, you are going to need a berth for it, but you cannot provide that. You want to back renewable energy projects in Tasmania, but even as recently as this morning the minister is on his feet saying, 'Marinus is great. It is going to bring in and unlock millions and billions of dollars' worth of investment to Tasmania, but we are not really sure whether we will back it. We are not sure if it is right for Tasmania.' How can it be that after 11 years in government, this government cannot back in the things that will secure the economy for Tasmania? The billions of dollars waiting to be invested are frustrated by the inactivity of this government, the inability of this government to get things done, to focus on the priorities and to look after Tasmanians.

There is no doubt a time will come where Tasmania will be impacted by these global shocks. There is no trust in the Tasmanian community, in the business community or in families of Tasmania that this government can protect us. It is our job to make sure that this government wake up, do the right thing, and protect Tasmanians from the global shocks that will come.

[11.31 a.m.]
Mr BEHRAKIS (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, there must be a federal election on the horizon. After spending years trying to act like every national or international economic shock that affects Tasmania is the fault of the Tasmanian government, here we are today talking about global economic shocks. We had a national cost-of-living crisis - it must be the Tasmanian government's fault. The international shipping delays and other issues caused by the war in Ukraine - it must be the Tasmanian government's fault. Now, there is a federal election and Albo is feeling the pressure -

Mr Winter - I am not sure Albo is feeling the pressure, to be honest. The other bloke -

Members interjecting.

Mr BEHRAKIS - and here we are today talking about global economic shocks. Let us be clear: the biggest shock facing Tasmania right now is not just global, it is the economic hypocrisy from those opposite. 

Mr Willie calls the federal Labor budget 'responsible', but let us look at the facts. It includes a decade of deficits, net debt surging to $768 billion by 2029, and a $1 trillion debt nationally. They cheer it on like it is good news and it is responsible. Let us not forget the 12 interest rate rises since Labor came to power in Canberra. What is fuelling those hikes? Labor's reckless spending and structural deficit. That is the real pain that Tasmanian families with mortgages are feeling right now. That is what Josh Willie and the Tasmanian Labor Party backs. It is that budget, every cent of it, that is hurting Tasmanian families while pretending to care about Tasmania's budgets here.

Let us be honest: the global economy is uncertain. There is no doubt about that. We have trade wars, tariffs, supply chain issues, and energy shocks, but Tasmania continues to stand strong. We have record low unemployment at 4 per cent. We have the highest wage growth in the nation at 3.9 per cent. We have retail trade at record highs at $741.8 million. We are number one in the country for business confidence - not something you hear being celebrated by those opposite. Our GSP is up 26.3 per cent in 10 years. Tasmania is growing, not shrinking, like it was when those opposite were in government with the Greens.

What is Labor's plan for Tasmania? It is simple: they have none. They have no costed policies, no alternative budget, despite this parliament voting and deciding to call on them to provide one. That would involve them providing a document they did not need to revise after 48 hours. Let us not forget who saddled us with $350 million of annual superannuation debt - those opposite. They raided the super provision account and they have costed zero plans to fix it.
We, on the other hand, continue to invest in Tasmania's future. We are investing $5.1 billion in infrastructure over the next four years, $1.9 billion in roads and bridges, $650 million in health infrastructure, $359 million in schools and education and $287 million in law and order infrastructure. Since 2014, $6 billion has been delivered, including the new K Block at the Royal Hobart Hospital, the new Bridgewater bridge, and the Midland Highway upgrades.

Labor says they want budget repair. They can start by presenting just one costed policy - maybe an alternative budget, if we are lucky, as the parliament asked for. We will wait, but will not hold our breath. You will have your chance; they will have their chance. At the end of May, when our budget is handed down, will they show leadership? Will they show the people of Tasmania what they stand for? I am not so sure. It will just be more negativity and no plan.

Tasmanians deserve leaders who invest in the future and do not just play politics. They deserve leaders who stand for something. We focus on delivering on health, housing, education and jobs, while carefully managing our debt. Labor is stuck in opposition mode. They have no ideas, no plans; just the same old tired rhetoric. We, on this side, will keep working to make Tasmania the best place to live, work and raise a family, no matter the global shocks that we face.

[11.35 a.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I would like to respond to the comments made by the Greens Member for Bass, Cecily Rosol, just now in a political attempt to try to demonstrate that there is some kind of split in the Labor Party position on the stadium. There is not.

I stand by the response that she read out to a constituent email that I sent. I understand the Greens have also provided that statement to the media, no doubt to try to play politics with this important issue. What I said in that email is that there are serious concerns about Macquarie Point and Jeremy Rockliff needs to be aware of those and deliver the promise that he made to Tasmanians. He made those promises to Tasmanians, he won the election, and it is up to him to demonstrate that he can keep those promises.

There are other options on the table. He is saying he is looking at all potential options. My email response to a constituent, who has written to me multiple times, is in line with that position. I will not name the constituent, because I understand the Greens member for Bass did not do that, but I would like to share with the House some of the emails that he has sent to me more recently.

Dr Woodruff - How do you know it is the same person?

Ms HADDAD - Because she read my response out verbatim, and she said 'Ms Haddad.'

Mr Abetz - Oopsie.

Mr Winter - Oh, look at you. 

Dr Woodruff - It is no secret. It is her email, sent to us by a constituent.

Ms HADDAD - In response to my email to him about Labor's position -

Members interjecting.

Ms HADDAD - If I could be heard, please?

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Ms Haddad has the call. Nobody else should be heard.

Dr Woodruff - Facebook page.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff.

Ms HADDAD - Deputy Speaker, I have limited time. I am going to share with the Chamber the email he sent to me in response to that:

Okay, Ella. I've had enough of your refusal to respond to all of my emails on the stadium issue. I'm coming up to your office to have it out with you, once and for all. You and Tasmanian Labor have lost all its former support in recent months. You are a pathetic lap dog - sorry, lap bitch.

Mr Winter - That is who you are backing.

Ms HADDAD - 

Your supporters cannot believe you could be so stupid on this issue. You are an opposition, for fuck sake. Get ready, we're coming. 

A member - Unbelievable.

Mr Winter - That is who you are supporting, Leader of the Greens. That is you. Dirt.

Ms HADDAD - I apologise for the swear word there but that is the email that he responded to. I responded immediately. I will redact his name, but I said:

Wow. I responded to [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=30.0_C=0.86]  your earlier email today before I saw this one. You won't find me at the office today because parliament is sitting. Please don't go and abuse my staff. They are not paid to be treated like that and I don't appreciate your threats or calling me a 'lap bitch.'

As I said, I saw this email after responding to your earlier one. I receive hundreds of emails a day. It isn't always possible for me to respond quickly, especially when I'm in parliament. While I understand your frustrations with me, I don't think threats and abuse are a great way to get across any point. It isn't how I operate or intend to correspond with you.
 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.7_D=29.5_C=0.78] 
Deputy Speaker, I found that email fairly shocking. I shared it with the Sergeant-at-Arms, and at his suggestion, it is now being shared with DPAC and police. I do not feel personally threatened by that, but many others would, and my staff certainly do not deserve to have somebody storm into the office based on something I have written and be sworn at and be called names like 'lap bitch', 'lap dog', 'stupid', and be sworn at in those terms. That is the kind of person they are supporting in sharing [Bookmark: Phr4_O=90.5_D=30.0_C=0.82]  statements with the media. 

Those emails have been reported and I will not be corresponding any further with that constituent - I would say constituent, but he signed off emails to me as living in Hobart, which is in my electorate; Battery Point, which is in my electorate; Dolphin Sands, in the electorate, I think, of Franklin or Lyons; Richmond, Richmond Estate - who knows. This person is a crackpot. 

Mr Winter - Hear, hear.

Ms HADDAD - He has signed off emails in a number of different ways. Also, without naming a particular vineyard, he has purported to be [Bookmark: Phr5_O=120.6_D=7.9_C=0.82]  associated with a well-known Tasmanian vineyard. I assumed that that was the case because he has signed off emails as if he represents that business. He does not. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=129.0_D=18.6_C=0.79]  That has been reported to the owners of that vineyard and that business who are not pleased at all that this person, who is sending threatening emails to members of parliament and threatening their hardworking staff, is passing himself off as someone associated with their business, which he is not.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=149.6_D=5.0_C=0.43] [11.39 a.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) -  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=154.6_D=11.0_C=0.66] Deputy Speaker, that is a terrible thing that I just heard from Ms Haddad. I sincerely feel awful that she is receiving an email like that.

Mr Winter - The words are 'I'm sorry'.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr Winter. 

Dr WOODRUFF - That is a horrendous way to speak to anyone [Bookmark: Phr9_O=166.4_D=28.1_C=0.78] , let alone to speak to a member of parliament who is doing her job representing her community. The Greens abhor language like that and we obviously find that utterly offensive. We strongly support Ms Haddad in taking any measures that she can to protect herself from that sort of behaviour. 

Ms Rosol was standing here before - and this matter of public importance has diverted widely from the issue that we were talking about - and she was reading out [Bookmark: Phr10_O=195.4_D=6.6_C=0.48]  Ms Haddad's words, not anything to do with the other person that Ms Haddad referred to, because I do not know anything about that. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=202.4_D=8.9_C=0.71]  I have never heard that and this is about what Ms Haddad said.

Ms Haddad - Then why share it with the media?

Mr Winter - That is a poor apology.

Ms Haddad - It is just politics. Why share a threatening email like that.

Mr Winter - Rolling around in the dirt.

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Members on my left. I will say, Dr Woodruff, that yes, we have drifted [Bookmark: Phr12_O=213.1_D=26.9_C=0.79]  a long way from the topic but it was the Greens spokesperson who stood up first who diverted the MPI topic to where we are now. 

Dr WOODRUFF - The MPI topic that Ms Rosol was referring to was about the risk to the state from making an extremely dangerous decision to approve a stadium that will cost us nearly $2 billion within the next 10 years [Bookmark: Phr13_O=240.4_D=3.1_C=0.57]  and what we have here [Bookmark: Phr14_O=244.2_D=28.4_C=0.67]  is Ms Haddad who was reading -
Mr Winter - The word is 'sorry.' Outrageous.

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Members on my left. I understand the tensions in here, but Dr Woodruff has the call.

Dr WOODRUFF - Ms Haddad sent an email with the words from the Labor Party saying Macquarie Point will not work.

Members interjecting.

Dr WOODRUFF - Our support is not for Macquarie Point because Macquarie Point just will not work, and this is what we were talking about. We were talking about the Labor Party's position [Bookmark: Phr15_O=272.7_D=30.0_C=0.82]  and the Labor Party's failure to do the basics of scrutinising such a massive, concerning debt that the government is looking at taking on for the state. They have one job, the most important job, which is to scrutinise the accounts of the government; scrutinise the decisions that are being made. The Leader of the Opposition, Dean Winter, has announced that he will be allowing the government to do [Bookmark: Phr16_O=302.9_D=1.6_C=0.95]  whatever they want, at any cost, for that stadium at Macquarie Point to be built. Labor has said time and again that they foreshadowed that they would vote for legislation to pass the stadium at Macquarie Point. 

Mr Winter - And you said you will not, no matter what.

Dr WOODRUFF - What we have here are words from a member of the Labor Party saying -

A member - You are facilitating someone who has conducted abusive behaviour.

Dr WOODRUFF - that her party's position is that Macquarie Point will not work, 'Our support is not for Macquarie Point because it just won't work.'

That is what we are talking about here today. Labor needs to explain to Tasmanians exactly what their position on the stadium is because, at the last count, they have changed five times.

Ms Haddad - We are not in government; it is up to the Premier to show that he can deliver what he promised.

Dr WOODRUFF - They changed from having stickers on their cars saying 'no stadium'. They had Ms White, the leader of the Labor Party before the election, promising Tasmanians that they would work to renegotiate the deal. They had Dean Winter saying, when he became the leader after the state election and after the May elections, that his position was changing and he was going to lead a party that would support the stadium. They would scrutinise it and make sure there was a cap of $375 million - 

Ms Haddad - That is right. That was the Premier's promise, and he won the election.

Dr WOODRUFF - The Macquarie Point Stadium.

Ms Haddad - No, 'a stadium' is what we said.

Dr WOODRUFF - Then we had Josh Willie, on behalf of Labor, announcing: 'Hands off, the government can do whatever it wants, it can cost anything, it can be bungled, it can break every planning law in Tasmania and Labor will support it.' Now, we hear Labor does not support the Macquarie Point Stadium; they support 'a stadium'.

A member - No, you are facilitating a person who was abusive.

Dr WOODRUFF - Obviously, they support stadium 2.0, the stadium that is Paul Lennon's stadium. Of course they do. What game are they playing here?

Members interjecting.

Ms Haddad - What game are you playing, sharing emails like that with the media?

Dr WOODRUFF - They are playing a game with billions of dollars of Tasmanians' money when they should be focusing on people's lives - 

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Dr WOODRUFF - and putting that money into health and housing infrastructure. 

Ms Haddad - An appalling way to behave.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Ms Haddad.

Dr WOODRUFF - It is shameful abrogation of their duty.

Ms Haddad - What you have done is shameful.

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - Jeez, this is your lowest point ever. Your absolute lowest point.

Dr WOODRUFF - It should be about health and housing, scrutinising the Budget and looking ahead at a $2 billion debt. That is what Labor should be doing.

Time expired.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - The Leader of the Opposition has the call for about 90 seconds.

[11.44 a.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - Deputy Speaker, the Leader of the Greens has just gone into the gutter, into the lowest point that I have ever seen any leader of the Greens go to. In not apologising to Ms Haddad just then, she is enabling the sort of attacks that Ms Haddad received.

Opposition members - Hear, hear.

Mr WINTER - She is an enabler of the sort of attack Ms Haddad heard today. All she had to do was stand up here and apologise, like any decent member of the House would. The Greens have peddled this email around to the media today from a man who has been intimidating members of parliament - and not just Ms Haddad, by the way, but other members of parliament anyone who disagrees with him - the worst people in our community who attack and threaten violence, who call people a 'lap bitch'. The Leader of the Greens had one job to do when she rose to her feet, and that was to say, 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry that we peddled this story around the media. I'm sorry we didn't know about the context.' Instead, she doubled down in her attack on Ms Haddad because she is desperate to be relevant.

Dr Broad - Shame.

Mr WINTER - If Thursday last week was not bad enough, this morning's effort from the Leader of Greens demonstrates where they are at morally and ethically. They are in the gutter.

Matter noted.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Members, please do not speak as you are leaving the Chamber, particularly when the Clerk of the House is on their feet. It is incredibly disrespectful.


JUSTICE AND RELATED LEGISLATION (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) (No. 2) 2024 (No. 45)

In Committee

Resumed from 3 April 2025 (page 91)

Clause 5 -
Schedule 1 amended (Criminal Code)

[11.46 a.m.]
Mr BARNETT - Chair, as a recap for colleagues, we have just been through clause 5. I thank colleagues in the Chamber for their encouragement and support for the bill. Clause 5 has been covered off. I indicated in my last remark that we are committed to updating and clarifying the law. We have moved that amendment on the floor as the fastest way to insert two new sexual offences into the operation of section 14A and confirm when mistake as to consent is not honest and reasonable. 

I was about to start on Clause 15.

DEPUTY CHAIR - Apparently, we are on clause 5 and you need to read the amendment in. 

Mr BARNETT - All right. Let us do that and deal with clause 5, which I have circulated. Let me read it for those listening. I move -

First amendment

Page 7, paragraph (b), proposed new subclause (1AA), proposed new definition of Relevant sexual offence, paragraph (a) of the definition, after "124A,".

Insert "124B, 124C,".

Second amendment

Page 8, paragraph (e), after "124A,".

Insert "124B, 124C,".

I think I have summarised matters with respect to clause 5.

Amendments agreed to.

Clause 5, as amended, agreed to.

Clauses 6 to 14 agreed to.

Clause 15 - 
Section 63 - amended (Disclosure of information)

Mr BARNETT - My proposed amendment to clause 15, which amends section 63 of the Forensic Procedures Act 2000, is to substitute the proposed 63(3)(a) in the bill with a simpler avoidance of doubt clause in relation to the meaning of 'offence'. The original intention of amending section 63 was to clarify that the meaning of 'offence' in section 63 subclause (3) is an offence under the law of Tasmania, another state or territory or the Commonwealth. This is the understanding across jurisdictions since similar legislation was enacted around the country, so that a fingerprint may be used, subject to the requirements of the act, to match in relation to offences in any jurisdiction.

The need for this amendment arose as it was noted that section 27 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1931 has a general provision that provides: 

References to localities, jurisdictions and other matters and things shall be construed as references to such localities, jurisdictions and other matters and things in and of this State.

This is an issue that the amendment is intended to clarify to avoid any concern that the reference to offence in section 63 is a thing limited to Tasmania. 

During drafting of the bill, some other purposes were included. In reflecting on questions on the bill raised in briefings of members, it was identified by the department that including these purposes might be taken to change the current law. In fact, these additional purposes are, in practice, managed in other ways when appropriate, such as through consents to information-sharing relating to criminal history checks.

The amendment I am putting forward to the bill focuses the amendment as originally intended to ensure the provisions of the act are clear and unambiguous. The amendment does not reflect any change in the longstanding intent and practice of the model legislation introduced across Australia in relation to management and sharing of fingerprint information in relation to offences.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=27.4_D=3.7_C=0.76] In conclusion, the amendment  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=32.3_D=28.2_C=0.85] I propose clarifies any doubt as to the interpretation of an offence under section 63, and I look forward to it being supported. I move -

Page 15, proposed new subsection (3A).

Leave out that subsection 

Insert instead the following subsection:

(3A)	For the avoidance of doubt, a reference to an offence in subsection (3) is a reference to an offence under the law of this State, or the law of another State, a Territory or the Commonwealth.

I will leave it there. I am happy to answer any queries, but again, I hope for support for this technical and administrative amendment.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=84.1_D=4.1_C=0.69] Ms HADDAD - I wanted to check with the Attorney-General - this  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=101.0_D=25.5_C=0.82] amendment will remove the proposed subsection (3A) in the bill and replace it with the amended subsection. I did not quite catch all of what you said in your preamble, but I note that it is quite a truncated version, just referring to offences under the law of this state or other states.

I am wondering whether that means that any of the procedural things referenced in the original subsection (3A [Bookmark: Phr10_O=127.5_D=4.6_C=0.64] ) - and you might have covered it in your preamble - but  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=132.6_D=5.7_C=0.83] whether that is still the intent of the bill. The original 3A went to some of the  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=140.1_D=5.3_C=0.77] ways that other law enforcement agencies might investigate or make decisions around proceedings and  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=147.6_D=2.4_C=0.91] investigations. I am wondering whether  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=151.4_D=12.8_C=0.80] the intent of the bill is still to have that same effect, or if the effect of the new subsection (3A) is different from the one proposed in the bill.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=183.0_D=24.0_C=0.88] Mr BARNETT - Based on advice, no, there is no change. The intent of that amendment is to confirm what is in the bill. I think you are aware, as I have outlined in terms of clause 15, which is obviously about inserting 3A, it specifies the lawful purposes for which forensic material may be disclosed  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=207.7_D=5.4_C=0.81] with other Australian jurisdictions. There is no change.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=216.5_D=10.4_C=0.59] Amendment agreed to.

Clause 15, as amended, agreed to.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=230.0_D=12.8_C=0.56]  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=244.3_D=4.0_C=0.55] Clauses 16 to 36 agreed to.

POLICE OFFENCES AMENDMENT BILL 2025 (No. 7)

Second Reading

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=77.2_D=6.5_C=0.26] [11.58 a.m.]
Mr ELLIS (Braddon - Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Management) -  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=125.2_D=9.0_C=0.70] Honourable Speaker, the Tasmanian government is committed to making Tasmanian communities and roads safer [Bookmark: Phr11_O=134.8_D=28.3_C=0.76]  through our strong plan to crack down on crime. We are committed to exploring any opportunity to support our police and community in achieving this.

The government has received advice from the Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management regarding amendments to the Police Offences Act 1935, which, in turn, approved the drafting of a hooning and other offences related bill. The Police Offences Amendment Bill 2025 is a bill designed to make Tasmanian communities and roads safer. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=163.3_D=29.8_C=0.82]  The bill has been subject to extensive consultation with government agencies and non-government organisations, as well as the Tasmanian community and business groups. It is with pleasure that I introduce this bill.

The bill provides for the new offence of road rage to address the rising concerns of aggressive and irrational driving behaviours. This includes verbal abuse or gestures which lead to altercations, property damage or vehicle collisions, all of which may result in serious [Bookmark: Phr13_O=193.4_D=29.8_C=0.75]  injury. I refer to one recent example where last October a 43-year-old man was sentenced to three years imprisonment for a road rage offence that the Tasmanian courts described as 'angry retribution for some perceived slight, and for the purposes of instilling fear.' This incident, which terrorised a husband and wife and their two children, was triggered by the victims allegedly having their high beam lights on as they passed the offender's vehicle. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=223.6_D=28.8_C=0.82]  This incident has left the husband with back injuries and suffering PTSD, with his wife needing to take leave from work. The older of the two children, a five-year-old boy, has been dealing with health issues and is receiving counselling as a result. 

In January this year, whilst reporting on a road rage offence between a pedestrian and a car, a Mercury newspaper reader poll revealed that 86 per cent of respondents indicated that they had experienced some road rage. When the Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management first [Bookmark: Phr15_O=253.3_D=2.8_C=0.70]  raised the road rage issue with government in 2024 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=256.7_D=29.8_C=0.81] , examples included property damage, assault, and assault with a weapon. Our government will not sit idle while this occurs. 

This specific type of offending must be deterred. Where it does occur, we need to send a strong message that this behaviour on Tasmanian roads will not be tolerated. Like those offences in other jurisdictions, such as 'predatory driving' in the Australian Capital Territory, 'menacing driving' in New South Wales, and road rage offences in Western Australia, this new road rage offence will [Bookmark: Phr17_O=286.6_D=2.8_C=0.57]  impose significant penalties for those who commit it. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=289.9_D=15.1_C=0.76]  The road rage offence will be made out where drivers use threatening, abusive, obscene or offensive language or other gestures or behaviour that cause harm, fear, distress or apprehension in another road user. This includes conduct that damages property or injures a person.

Research has shown through TasCOSS submission material that aggression is a threat to road safety and increases the risk of a crash. Law enforcement can be viewed as a legitimate strategy for changing attitudes, and for road rage offenders to be held to account for their behaviour.

I note, however, that this bill does not interfere with the court's discretion regarding sentencing options. A person who is found to commit such an offence will be liable to arrest and on conviction may, at the discretion of the court, be fined or sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Offending vehicles will also be subject to clamping or confiscation.

With regard to youths who may be detected committing a road rage offence, I pause to state that there are limitations on arrest powers under the provisions of the Youth Justice Act 1997. Further to that, this is not a prescribed offence under the act, which means that where appropriate, early intervention and diversion is an option. The Tasmanian government fully supports a therapeutic approach as an investment in the safety and wellbeing of young people. This approach is underpinned by the 'Youth Justice Blueprint 2024-2034'. I fully support that in conjunction with our responsibilities towards public safety.

Currently in Tasmania, when investigating road rage type offences, Tasmania Police look to rely on other offences to deal with these incidents, such as negligent driving, destroying or injuring property, or common assault. This new offence will provide specific legislative recognition of the serious impacts of road rage incidents to both victims and to the public generally. It is an important step towards making the Tasmanian community and roads safer.

Acknowledging the danger of road rage and discouraging it from occurring ought to be supported by other legislation. This bill also recognises that certain offences which have a significant impact on safety on our roads should have penalties for those offences being commensurate with the danger they pose. As such, the bill increases penalties for motor vehicle stealing and hooning offences.

Aside from the economic impact or the potential for the loss of an innocent person's primary transport, the theft of a motor vehicle poses a great risk on our roads, particularly where the stolen vehicle is driven by an inexperienced or substance-affected driver. In Tasmania, the penalty for motor vehicle stealing is currently a fine not exceeding 50 penalty units or $10,100, and a term of imprisonment not exceeding three years. These penalties are insufficient, and they are inconsistent with other jurisdictions where the fines may be double those in Tasmania, and have periods of imprisonment averaging 10 years. The bill proposes doubling the maximum fine for motor vehicle stealing to 100 penalty units or $20,200.

Hooning vehicles - such as those used to perform burnouts, create excessive noise or smoke, or an execution of speed or acceleration or race against another vehicle on our streets - pose an unacceptable risk to the public. The bill doubles the penalties for these offences to a maximum of 40 penalty units, or $8080, and/or an imprisonment period for up to six months.

Further to this, the bill enhances the ability for police to investigate and deal with reports of hooning and other prescribed offences. Currently, for police to clamp or confiscate a car used in hooning, dangerous or reckless driving, evading police or some disqualified driving offences, they must first observe or witness the offence rather than learning of it from another person or inferring it from evidence such as video footage. This current threshold does not support the use of evidence captured by electronic means from the public, other infrastructure, or surveillance cameras. This does not align with road safety campaigns whereby members of the public are requested to report poor driving behaviour, hooning, or road rage related offences, nor with other legislation that requires police to form a reasonable belief.

The bill will require a police officer to form a reasonable belief that a person is or has committed hooning or prescribed offences. This, in addition to any electronic evidence, will still require supporting evidentiary materials such as statutory declarations and witness accounts for the laying of a charge.

In addition, the validity of any clamping or confiscation will, as is the case now, be subject to court proceedings. Where a vehicle is clamped or confiscated for a prescribed offence as mentioned, the seriousness of the offending warrants an increase in those periods of clamping and confiscation.

For the first offence, the clamping or confiscation period will increase from 28 days to three months, and the second offence from three to six months. Where a vehicle has been clamped or confiscated for a third or subsequent offence, upon conviction for that offence, the vehicle will be forfeited to the Crown unless the offending driver, owner or registered operator apply to the court for return of the vehicle. Currently, police are required to apply to the court for a forfeiture order where there has been a third or subsequent offence conviction. This automatic forfeiture provision mirrors that of South Australia, which demonstrates a strong commitment to reducing dangerous driving behaviours on our roads.

There are a number of miscellaneous amendments relating to traffic policing and clamped and confiscated vehicles. These include reducing the time period for disposal of non-recovered, clamped or confiscated vehicles from nine to six months; removing the requirement for an application to the court for forfeiture of a vehicle used in an 'evade police' offence where the driver has not been identified or an application for its return has not been made; doubling the penalties for interfering with confiscated vehicles being transported to a holding yard, or removing a vehicle from a holding yard to a maximum of, respectively, 40 penalty units, which is $1080, and 18 penalty units, which is $16,160; and doubling the penalty for a vehicle owner or operator who does not comply with a legal demand to identify the driver of a vehicle at the time that an offence was committed to a maximum of 100 penalty units or $20,200. Maximum penalties for these offences have been increased to better align with other jurisdictions and to meet community expectations of proportionate penalties.

In relation to community safety, the bill makes a number of amendments to the act, including a number of penalties for offences against persons and property. Passenger transport and ferry services will now be included in the definition of a 'public place'. The amendment is essential in reducing confusion for police officers dealing with incidents or offences on public transport services.
Penalties are also increased for trespass offences where the offender is in possession of a firearm. The fine is increased from 100 penalty units or $20,200 to a maximum of 150 penalty units or $30,300, with the maximum term of imprisonment increased from two to three years. The latter increase will ensure that the offence remains a summary matter whilst closer aligning the gap between summary and entitlement matters.

Penalties are also increased for property offences such as destroying or injuring property. Tasmania currently has the lowest penalties across all Australian jurisdictions for these offences. The bill increases the maximum penalty for property offences from 10 penalty units, or $2020, and 12 months' imprisonment to a maximum of 50 penalty units, or $10,100, and two years' imprisonment.

These changes reflect, where the court deems appropriate, the increased financial hardship on victims of property damage, and better aligns Tasmania's penalties with that of other Australian jurisdictions.

I turn to assault offences. In Tasmania, the maximum penalties for common assault are at the lower end of the scale when compared to interstate penalties. The increase to assault penalties reflects the seriousness of violent offences upon the community and more closely aligns the Tasmanian maximum penalties with those in other jurisdictions.

The increase in penalties is as follows. For a common assault, from 20 penalty units and 12 months' imprisonment to 50 penalty units, or $10,100, and 18 months' imprisonment. Where the assault is considered aggravated in nature, this penalty increases from 50 penalty units and two years' imprisonment to 100 penalty units, or $20,200, and three years' imprisonment. These increases will provide a broader range of discretion and afford the court an opportunity to apply a penalty proportionate to the facts that are presented and subsequent to the seriousness of the offence and/or the offender's personal circumstances.

This bill, of course, does not impede any sentencing options the court would have for therapeutic or other rehabilitative purposes.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=8.5_D=27.5_C=0.81] Finally, I turn to matters relating to evidence. For offences relating to computers, mobile phones have been explicitly included in the definition of a computer. The inclusion of mobile phones as a computer will accommodate computer-related and other fraud offences where a phone or similar internet-enabled device is used. 

The bill also improves evidentiary provisions as they relate to property complaints and consorting offences.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=36.4_D=27.8_C=0.83] The amendments will create an averment negating the need for a property owner to be called as a witness where their property has been injured or destroyed, or a motor vehicle stolen. Victims of crime, including agencies such as housing providers and business owners, are regularly called to give evidence in court proceedings to merely state that they were the property or vehicle owner and that the charged person did not have their permission to destroy, injure or steal that property. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=64.4_D=29.0_C=0.78]  This new provision is contained within existing averments already in the act, such as those which relate to age, liquor and licensed premises where the charge is contested, and will not discharge the onus of the prosecution to the satisfaction of the court. 

In relation to consorting of convicted offenders who have been given an official warning, an averment will apply to the official warning having been authorised, served and in force at the time of the alleged offence.  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=93.8_D=16.0_C=0.89] This will, given the five-year life of an official warning, address the burden to the court where witnesses are not freely available to give evidence of those administrative matters.

This amendment is similar to the evidential provisions for orders relating to family violence [Bookmark: Phr6_O=110.1_D=11.1_C=0.78]  and underpins the prevention of convicted offenders establishing, maintaining and expanding criminal networks. The bill is to commence on royal assent, and I commend the bill to the House.

We recognise the bulk of work undertaken by the department, including Jim Semmens and Jason, to bring this bill into fruition. I also thank the department for the briefing.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=164.9_D=25.7_C=0.76] We had quite a rushed briefing yesterday. There are a lot of amendments within this bill. There is a whole bulk of work that has gone into this. 

We will always support police in Tasmania. We have consulted with the Police Association of Tasmania in relation to this bill and they say that the additional powers that are within this bill are something that the members are happy with. We will approach speaking to this bill from that perspective, but we also need to make sure that we put some questions on the record because there is some overreach in certain aspects of this bill.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=191.6_D=8.7_C=0.71]  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=203.7_D=8.5_C=0.90] First, we thought it would be important for the minister to clarify whether the definition of 'vehicle' in this bill also refers to motorbikes and motorised bikes.  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=230.8_D=28.1_C=0.86] This is an issue that has been put to us by many people in our respective electorates over a long period of time. We understand that this bill now incorporates passenger transport and ferry services in the definition of 'public place', meaning police have clear guidelines, finally, with respect to ferry services and passenger transport services. I think that also relates to [Bookmark: Phr17_O=259.8_D=6.3_C=0.81]  Metro buses and provides them with more  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=267.2_D=8.4_C=0.85] certainty around the prosecuting of offences occurring under that definition of a public place.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=276.7_D=2.4_C=0.92] We understand that  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=281.0_D=5.8_C=0.59] this bill seeks to also clarify and separate trespass  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=289.7_D=14.8_C=0.70] provisions within the Police Offences Act. We were advised in the briefing that the bill separates that out to two separate trespass offences. There is trespass and then there is trespass with a firearm. We understand that provision has been added to this bill after consultation with farmers from across our state. I have met with a number who are concerned about poachers and different people coming onto their land. They are not quite sure if those people have firearms and that can be extremely dangerous for them. This does provide that with some certainty. Trespass with the firearm increases penalties and imprisonment under this amendment bill to three years from one year, and 150 penalty units from 50 penalty units.

The second reading speech states trespass laws which include trespassing, attaching oneself to vehicles, buildings, et cetera are not included in the amendment. However, a question is needed to clarify whether this amendment, in relation to trespass with a firearm, ties in the sections with interest passed within the act, when it talks about people who attach themselves as a form of protest to machinery or buildings or so forth. Is that one sweep, which is including all of them, or does that still stand alone because the penalties are not clear underneath that? I hope that question makes sense. Protest as trespassing and attaching themselves to machinery or artwork or buildings will be subjected to the same penalties as trespassing with a firearm.

I want to also clarify in your response to our questions today whether or not the doubling of most of the fines and imprisonment terms are mandatory, and if you can provide some interpretation around those sentences for the record. It has been brought to our attention that it could be perceived as mandatory sentencing.

I am also keen to understand the minister's insights into whether or not the increase of penalties for crimes does actually lead to a reduction in crimes. Most of my investigations into this have found that it is not a deterrent to people when they are conducting these crimes. If we are doubling penalty units or increasing fines, could you provide some insight to the House as to why you consider doubling penalty units would bring down the crime rate, and whether or not they will be effective? In other countries and states the doubling of those fines has actually had no real impact at all. It sounds good on paper, but has that been effective at all?

I am also interested in how many of those fines become monetary penalty community service orders (MPCSO) - people who cannot afford those fines, how they go about repaying those fines and whether or not it is not only done through the Monetary Penalty Enforcement Service (MPES), or the MPCSO. We are not saying that we do not agree. We are interested in your reasoning for the doubling of these fines, and whether or not you have evidence that doubling those fines will help to reduce crime in our state. That was also raised by TasCOSS when they responded to this bill in their submission. It stated:

TasCOSS does not support the introduction of clauses increasing penalties and recommends these clauses are withdrawn from the Bill. As an alternative to increased penalties, we recommend the Tasmanian Government focuses on strategies and initiatives to prevent crime, and investing in community-based services to support people with underlying needs contributing to criminal behaviour (such as unaddressed mental health issues, alcohol and other drug use, or homelessness).

That does make sense, but we know those things are expensive to implement. We know that this government is finding it very hard to balance their budget at the moment. They have just cut $35 million from the police budget. We understand that doubling fines is cheap and is good PR for the government to do. It does not involve you having to invest in good [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=10.0_C=0.75]  intervention or diversion programs, but could the minister provide some reasoning to the House about why that approach has been taken?

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=41.1_D=2.5_C=0.89] We know there has been [Bookmark: Phr4_O=45.3_D=26.0_C=0.71]  common assault. It is an increase of 20 penalty units to 50 penalty units; aggravated assault is 50 to 100 penalty units; unlawfully assaulted is 50 to 100 penalty units; indecent intent to assault is also doubled. Offences relating to property - and that is including to animals, around maiming or wounding. We know tha [Bookmark: Phr5_O=72.2_D=16.8_C=0.85] t is often the case in family violence incidents or events. Often an animal will be harmed. Sometimes that can also be seen as [Bookmark: Phr6_O=90.9_D=19.3_C=0.73]  a bit of a canary in the mine for many people who are fleeing family violence. Sometimes the maiming or the harming of an animal is that last straw for people if they are able to flee. That was positive that that was placed in here.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=111.7_D=10.0_C=0.82] There has been a wording change from 'penalty' to 'a fine' for damaging or interfering with work by a council. The cost is one penalty unit, so that is $200 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=123.3_D=20.0_C=0.82] , for interfering with a council's work. I was wondering why the minister did not increase that fine at all. That could be quite serious for many councils, especially if they are working on major works and there is damage done to that. It only has one penalty unit associated with that [Bookmark: Phr9_O=144.0_D=11.0_C=0.79] , so can the minister run through that?

Motor vehicle stealing has been doubled; procuring the higher use of motor vehicle by fraud [Bookmark: Phr10_O=157.0_D=8.9_C=0.80] . Can the minister run through that reasoning behind increasing penalties, and whether there is any evidence to suggest that would be beneficial?

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=168.0_D=15.6_C=0.84] We support the inclusion of road rage within this Police Offences Amendment Bill. This provision is driver-specific and provides police with a clear avenue for dealing with people who are conducting menacing driving as a driver-related act. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=185.8_D=28.4_C=0.81]  We know that globally incidents of road rage are increasing. We know that many people have been subject to road rage events. The event which the minister referred to in his second reading speech is an absolutely harrowing event. Our thoughts go out to that family. We support police having greater power [Bookmark: Phr13_O=214.6_D=2.0_C=0.83]  to be able to [Bookmark: Phr14_O=218.2_D=6.3_C=0.77]  crackdown on road rage, and be able to charge and prove that road rage incidents have occurred.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=227.1_D=26.5_C=0.86] There was a provision at the end of that, section 37FAa section (c), relating to road rage provisions, including immediately after that person has driven or used a vehicle and how this provision may be used in practice by a police officer utilising this in a charge. Could the minister provide [Bookmark: Phr16_O=254.4_D=3.1_C=0.91]  some process around what that may look like [Bookmark: Phr17_O=258.8_D=19.8_C=0.79] ? Does that provision relate to if there has been a car incident or car accident and a person gets out of their car and runs over to another person and thumps them? Is that the reasoning behind that section of this provision?

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=280.6_D=19.1_C=0.80] We are also quite supportive of your work here with hooning and trying to crack down on hooning. There has been an increase in penalty units and there has also been an increase in imprisonment times. Can the minister provide information to us on disqualification from driving for hooning? We know, from the feedback from our electorate, that hooning is a huge issue for a lot of people, especially in quieter communities where there is excessive hooning. We think it is positive that, instead of the act reading 'finds a person offending', that a police officer actually has to view a person or group in the act hooning, that will be substituted with, 'has reasonable grounds for believing that a person is committing or has committed'. That will make it a lot less cumbersome for the police to be able to prove that there has been hooning. They will be able to use other evidence towards building that case that there has been hooning behaviour. We are supportive of that because what we have at the moment is not working because hooning continues to be a big issue for a lot of our communities.

On that, a shout-out to the New Norfolk Neighbourhood Watch group, which has been vocal in this area for a long time. It is a peaceful community constantly interrupted in antisocial times of the night, waking up whole communities with bike riding and hooning, which is loud and intimidating to a lot of residents, keeping them up all night and keeping their children up all night. It is so inconsiderate. It is positive that police will have the powers to be able to intervene and try to stop that behaviour happening.

We have questions around the forfeiture orders when it comes to the confiscation of vehicles. We know confiscation of vehicles has been a positive tool. The more police are empowered to be able to confiscate vehicles, especially when drivers have evaded police, the safer our communities will be. We understand that. However, this is quite a big change, so we will be asking the minister a lot of questions around this. 

Can the minister clarify whether, under section 37Y, subdivision (3), under forfeiture orders, the amendment means that instead of the court 'may', this would mean that the court 'must' make a forfeiture order, to take effect 14 days after making the order? My understanding of the use of the word 'must' is that it will be mandatory and I do not support mandatory for many things. It is fraught, especially legally, taking those kind of decisions away from a court.

We understand that our court system is quite congested at the moment and we understand that police are having to store a lot of confiscated vehicles. We also understand that hooning is a large issue and we do need to crack down on that. Can the minister talk us through his interpretation of the word 'must', as opposed to 'may', when it is dealing with our court system? That, in my understanding, suggests an absolute obligation by the court, which may be an overreach. 

It is also compounded by going from having a six-month time to put in a forfeiture order appeal to 14 days under this bill. I raised this in briefings. We need to make sure that when we are providing our hard-working police officers with additional powers that human rights, due diligence and proper legal process is also adhered to. We need to make sure we have that right balance.

Going from six months to 14 days could potentially be placing some of the most vulnerable people in our community in a difficult position. I know this is for the third time a person has been charged with an offence on separate occasions. If a person has been charged with evading police and hooning, and their car has been confiscated and a forfeiture order has been made by the court because it must be made, they have 14 days to appeal that. A person may have taken their mum and dad's car, or their nan's car, or a mate's car to do that hooning. They will have 14 days to appeal that forfeiture order. If that person has poor literacy - and we have the highest proportion of people in Australia who are functionally illiterate - we understand that that order can be submitted through the Justice website. That would require that person to also have digital access. Tasmania has the worst digital access in Australia for people as far as digital literacy goes. That is also an impediment. 

Is that 14 working days? What would that look like over a Christmas period, when the normal systems and processes of our courts may not be working as effectively? I think 14 days could be too short. Going from six months to 14 days is a lot. Can the minister provide some clarification around that? We want to make sure we get this balance right between making our community safer and being tough on crime but also making sure people's civil rights are held in just as high regard. We know you do tend to overreach sometimes, minister. 

They are our main questions. We will have lots of questions as we go through now. Actually, there was one more question. Under this, when it comes to the forfeiture of a vehicle, it is based on the driver, so it is the driver's behaviour that causes that forfeiture of the vehicle, and that is on the third occasion. On that third occasion, is it that vehicle that is destroyed or forfeited to the Crown? Does that also include the second time they were caught hooning and so forth? Does that vehicle also get destroyed? Also, the first time, does that vehicle get destroyed or forfeited to the Crown? Is it just the third time and that is the vehicle that gets destroyed, or is it all three or is it is it number two and three, or is it number one and three? Can you provide some more clarification on that?

We will probably be discussing a lot in committee as the afternoon goes on, but they are our main concerns at the moment.
[12.37 p.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Deputy Speaker, I thank the minister's office and members of Tasmania Police, who were exceptionally generous in their time, offering us a briefing and a vast number of examples. It is a shame that this bill has been blurred with the knife crime bill that we looked at last week. That is evident in a number of the submissions, where aspects of this bill, which was explained through the briefing, may have been intended to be more administrative or closing a gap, rather than tough on crime, as the knife crime was a little bit further leaning towards. 

Notwithstanding that, aspects of this bill which double the penalties for some crimes are again proposed without proper investment into programs that are deterrents, not just being heavier on fines and a threat of more jail to deter. It is surprising that for a bill that has 'hooning' in its title, there are absolutely no submissions from the automotive sector, insurance companies or driver training programs. I wonder if that is because it was confused with the knife crime bill?

I am a little bit disappointed. I thought we were going to have a bill fully about hooning, and I was very excited about that, but it is a little bit more eclectic than just hooning. That is just one component of the bill, which is also increasing penalties for common assault, unlawful entry to land and comprising of some parts of the act that are being proposed. There is, of course, also - wait for it - a new law which I did not think this government was for, after a couple of their antics last week, but here we are.

On the increase of penalties, as we have repeatedly seen in this place and as multiple research projects from across the globe have shown, simply increasing penalties for a crime is not a solid deterrent. This bill, in particular, is asking parliament to approve a doubling of the maximum penalty units and a 50 per cent increase in maximum prison time for a significant number of unrelated offences, and very little justification is provided beyond a broad comparison to other states and territories. If this government was serious about reviewing penalties, would not the Sentencing Advisory Council be the appropriate body to undertake that work? There should be evidence for penalty increases. In this case, there is none.

I would also query whether it is the role of police to propose such a significant range of penalty increases. As far as I understand, this has not come from the Department of Justice. I would like to read from TasCOSS's submission on the penalty increases. On page 7 it says:

The underlying assumption of the proposed changes in the bill is that increased penalties will reduce offending. However, academic research into sentencing and its impact on criminal behaviour show that not always to be the case.

TasCOSS also states their concern about the disproportionate impact of fines on people on low incomes, noting academic research demonstrates the inherent unfairness of imposing financial penalties as punishment, as the impact of such penalties is significantly harsher for those on low incomes. They go on further:

… we recommend that the Tasmanian Government focuses on strategies and initiatives to prevent crime, and investing in community-based services to support people with underlying needs contributing to criminal behaviour (such as unaddressed mental health issues, alcohol and other drug use or homelessness).

On unlawful entry to land, the proposed doubling of the penalty - or tripling if someone has a firearm - was explained at the request of a stakeholder. I am wondering if we can see the criminal statistics that back that proposed necessary change. This was spruiked as a benefit in the case where a property owner may perhaps have a family violence order in place, in which case there would be a breach of the order and possible other offences depending on those circumstances. 

I want to highlight that what Tasmania really needs in such an example is that long-promised review of the Family Violence Act. We need to consolidate the act and ensure that it is fit for purpose, and to improve any related police legislation harmoniously and strategically, not just have those improvements scattered across other bills such as the hooning bill. That also applies to the increase in hurt caused to an animal, as Ms Butler touched on.

The increased penalties for assault and property offences are, as noted, disproportionate to the seriousness of the offence. Yes, other states have some penalties for comparable pieces of legislation, but at a Tasmanian scale of economics, what is being proposed is beyond reasonable, nor is it effective in deterring offending. For several of the proposed amendments, there are other parts of the Police Offences Act that would apply. anyway.

Onto the actual hooning part: I will read from the Tasmanian Law Society's submission:

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.7_D=24.8_C=0.85] The offence is committed if it results in another person feeling alarmed, distressed, apprehensive or fearful, including as a result of verbal abuse or threatening or obscene gestures, (having regard to the definition of "driving related act").

The words 'alarm', 'distress', 'apprehensive' and 'fearful' are extremely broad, and cannot be measured objectively, which may result in a person claiming to feel distressed, alarmed, apprehensive or fearful in circumstances where  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=55.6_D=11.8_C=0.76] it is objectively not reasonable. As an example, a person who is shown the middle finger by another driver may claim to have been alarmed, placing the driver at risk of arrest without warrant, fined or imprisoned.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=68.5_D=22.4_C=0.74] There are other jurisdictions that have hooning and road rage offences that are much more specific to the behaviour or actions that have been criminalised than what we see before us. I know the minister spoke about New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. Specifically in New South Wales, the definition of predatory and menacing driving is very clear:

Predatory driving offence is driving to pursue another vehicle intending to cause a collision or impact between two vehicles,  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=103.2_D=5.6_C=0.88] and intending by that course of conduct to cause a person in the other vehicle actual bodily harm. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=110.1_D=19.5_C=0.79] 

Menacing driving is driving in a way that is meant to threaten or appear threatening to another person or property.

Menacing driving is listed as an offence under the Road Transport Act 2013 in New South Wales.

What we have before us is trying to fill a legislative hole similar to that in New South Wales, but it is still far too broad. What we have here is a list of prescribed actions that are wide ranging, emotive and open to subjective interpretation. There is risk of subconscious bias for the offensive behaviour causing alarm, distress and fear. That is an incredibly low bar to set when paired with the low threshold for the use of profane or insulting words or an obscene gesture, which means that a wide range of relatively tame behaviours could see the potential for six months' imprisonment.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=132.6_D=9.2_C=0.82]  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=167.5_D=7.2_C=0.81] This offence, as written, blurs the line between dangerous driving and impolite or subjectively perceived offensive behaviour.  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=175.9_D=16.3_C=0.86] Most of the other listed circumstances, as in the horrific example that the minister used in his second reading speech, could be dealt with under other parts of existing legislation. The road rules capture dangerous driving and reckless driving.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=194.6_D=12.3_C=0.78] As with most other offences in the bill that is being put forward, there is existing legislation for it.

On motor vehicle theft, the bill increases the penalty to 100 penalty units, so around  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=207.3_D=27.1_C=0.80] $20,200. If you are stealing a car, you probably cannot afford that sort of fine. Career car thieves were given as an example. Could the minister please table some statistics from the last few years that show the number of career car thieves in the state? I also note that if there are any wealthy career car thieves that have been convicted of these offences, then they are likely to have their wealth confiscated  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=235.4_D=2.6_C=0.90] under other proceeds of crime legislation.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=239.4_D=24.4_C=0.81] Disposing of the confiscated vehicle - section 37H - is moving from one month to two months, and that certainly has merit. In regard to section 37N - the clamping and confiscation of vehicles, I am not sure if it was a late April Fool's joke or something, but there is a very interesting ABC article where in Western Australia  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=265.1_D=5.8_C=0.67] under comparable legislation, the Western Australia Police actually seized a Maserati  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=271.3_D=30.0_C=0.74] and proceeded to put signage on it as a form of education. It is a little bit questionable. I want to discourage Tasmania Police from doing that here because we do not have many Maseratis here. We do not want to end up with a ton of early model Corollas on the streets with signage. It is not quite going to have the same effect. 

Mr Ellis - It is a Commodore I think. We use it on the skip van.

Ms BADGER - Oh, a Commodore? I think we should do better, minister Ellis. Where are our Ferraris? 

On Section 37Y - the forfeiture of vehicles [Bookmark: Phr18_O=301.6_D=3.3_C=0.59]  - these provisions shift from court-based evidence, so 'has been found offending', to police power, substituting the words 'has reasonable grounds for believing'. This was justified as helping to clear the court backlog by providing the police with these extra powers.

Certainly, we do not disagree that there is a need to clear the court backlog, but increasing police powers is not necessarily the way to go forward. What we should be doing, again, is dealing with the underlying factors of people in Tasmania's society that are committing crime.

The example given was of being able to confiscate vehicles if there is footage of the offence being committed with a clear view of the number plate. That was a persuasive argument, but importantly that is not the only thing this bill provides for. This bill is providing for reasonable belief. We know from phase one of the recent police wanding trial that 50 persons were searched for the dangerous article on grounds of reasonable belief, and about 10 of those had a dangerous article, so that is 20 per cent.

I have now seen a media release from the phase two statistics, and the new statistics seem to be just shy of 25 per cent. Many Tasmanians would no doubt consider being able to confiscate vehicles on clear video evidence reasonable, but the number of people who would consider that reasonable would likely steeply decline if they were told only 25 per cent of those vehicles confiscated were actually involved in the commission of an offence.

There are some good parts of this bill that we fully support, such as the inclusion of public transport as a public place, just as taxis already are, and mobile phones being included under computer offences. I note in relation to mobile phones - are the police not already operating on the basis that phones are included as computers? Of course they are; it is 2025. Police are already empowered to remove people from public transport if a bus driver has directed the offending parties to get off the bus.

While the Greens absolutely support aspects of the reforms in this bill, none of them are essential and they tend to offer minor benefits. The reforms that we do support do not outweigh the issues that we have with this bill.

[12.49 p.m.]
Mrs BESWICK (Braddon) - Deputy Speaker, I speak in support of the Police Offences Amendment Bill 2025. This bill makes some common sense updates to the Police Offences Act, which has been part of Tasmania's legal climate for close to 90 years. Although the act has been updated several times in the past, laws do not always age like fine wine, especially when society, technology and inspections are constantly evolving. What we have before us today is not change for change's sake, but thoughtful, practical reform that reflects realities for modern Tasmania. After all, mobile phones are computers.

One of the most welcome aspects of this bill is the deliberate effort to lessen the burden on our courts. That is something that I am genuinely pleased to see. Our court system is doing important and often difficult work, but it is stretched, and unnecessarily so in many cases. Some matters simply do not need to consume to court time and resources, especially when there are more efficient, effective pathways available. These amendments help streamline certain offences and processes, reducing unnecessary demands on our legal system while still ensuring justice is served. That means faster resolutions, fewer delays and ultimately better outcomes for the people of Tasmania. 

Availability of courts is a particularly poignant issue in Braddon, with many councils, community groups and residents bringing this to my attention over the past 12 months. The adjustments in clause 28, which will remove the need for unnecessary witness statements and court proceedings, is a logical and effective removal of red tape in this system. I hope we are all in agreement with this and we can create a little efficiency in a sector that needs it.

I draw particular attention to the amendment that stands out in the introduction of the new offence of what is commonly referred to as 'road rage'. I will be honest; road rage is not a phrase I have historically used all that often. I have often associated this with frustrated drivers who feel wronged by another on the road. A favourite saying in our family is: 'Remember everyone else on the road is an idiot'.

Road rage seems a slightly sensational term, but with reassurance from members of my team, road rage is indeed the descriptive term for aggressive, reckless, often violent behaviour on our roads, putting people at serious risk while they are simply trying to travel from A to B. The more I reflect on it, the more I have seen and heard, and the more I have understood how necessary this addition to the law is. It is hard to ignore the wave of footage that keeps coming across our screens, dash cam clips and mobile phone videos capturing moments of road rage in frightening detail: tailgating, verbal abuse, drivers getting out of their cars to confront others, even deliberate damage to vehicles. It is not just ugly behaviour, it is dangerous, and it is heartbreaking that it is happening more and more often.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=27.8_D=16.9_C=0.81] What this bill does is recognise that kind of behaviour for what it is: antagonistic, terrorising, abusive behaviour and offence. It ensures those who engage in it can be held accountable. It also sends a strong message to the community, that if you behave violently or threatening behind the wheel, there are consequences. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=45.7_D=13.5_C=0.76]  This is about more than deterrence. It is about keeping people safe. No one should feel unsafe getting into their car. No one should have to look over their shoulder or fear that another driver's temper may steal into something more serious.
 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=60.7_D=23.9_C=0.64] 
This bill takes a somewhat balanced approach. It does not necessarily overreach; it does not criminalise ordinary driving frustrations. It targets these serious, aggressive, often violent acts. It gives police and courts a clearer framework to respond to when that act occurs. I generally support this bill. I support the effort to modernise our legislation. I support the move to ease pressure on our courts. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=86.2_D=16.0_C=0.64]  I strongly support the inclusion of road rage provisions that are protecting the public and reinforcing basic standards of decency and safety on our road.

I am interested in a lot of the questions and the responses to those questions that have been raised. I think there are some really valid arguments being made [Bookmark: Phr6_O=103.0_D=5.7_C=0.79]  about some of the clauses, as it is a bit of a complex bill with lots of little bits and pieces all through it [Bookmark: Phr7_O=110.5_D=11.5_C=0.71] . Generally I am keen to see this in the main go through.

[12.54 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=127.8_D=0.8_C=0.49] Mr JENNER (Lyons) - [Bookmark: Phr9_O=129.8_D=6.3_C=0.41]  Deputy Speaker, as an ex-magistrate I totally agree with being tough on crime, as we should be. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=146.8_D=7.0_C=0.61]  I support the bill in parts. I am slightly concerned about a few, which I will cover. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=156.2_D=10.4_C=0.77]  I know others want to contribute, so I will keep it as short as I can.

Like many others, I have concerns about the bill. It appears to be driven mainly by optics, by the outcomes [Bookmark: Phr13_O=167.6_D=18.9_C=0.76] , a way a government can showcase its tough on crime credentials. I question whether the legislation is generally achievable in its intended purpose. Laws should be effective, not just performative. We need to ask whether the bill is actually improving the community safety or is it simply designed as a political message [Bookmark: Phr14_O=189.8_D=16.2_C=0.84] . I know Ms Butler stated in her reply that there does not appear to be much evidence to show that doubling penalties actually reduces crime. I know from my experience that is true.

My concerns about the legislation is that it is highly subjective. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=208.4_D=4.8_C=0.74]  If you were talking about hooning or talking about someone [Bookmark: Phr16_O=214.2_D=1.8_C=0.93]  being abusive in a car [Bookmark: Phr17_O=217.1_D=26.4_C=0.77]  - a little old lady of 80, someone goes past and bips her horn because she is doing something wrong perhaps, may see that as totally aggressive and report it. You have one person's word against another's. I am slightly concerned that there are things in place to make sure that it is not just subjective to one officer [Bookmark: Phr18_O=244.2_D=0.6_C=0.92]  or one person.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=246.7_D=5.0_C=0.72] I know a lot of this has been said, but it is important that [Bookmark: Phr20_O=252.7_D=2.2_C=0.86]  there are a few more checks and balances in place [Bookmark: Phr21_O=256.8_D=2.8_C=0.80] . What mig [Bookmark: Phr22_O=261.8_D=4.2_C=0.74] ht be provocative to one person might be different to another. [Bookmark: Phr23_O=267.1_D=25.4_C=0.82]  It is up to the discretion of the officer with very limited evidence needed. As I said, with one person's word against another, I would like to see perhaps a few guardrails in that. It takes also the decision away from the judiciary on the third strike for the vehicles where they can impound the car. That is really what the Magistrates Courts are for. [Bookmark: Phr24_O=293.3_D=7.0_C=0.63]  The police are there to administer the law and the judiciary is there then to sentence [Bookmark: Phr25_O=301.0_D=2.3_C=0.86] . This takes it away from them.

I totally agree with the proposed punishment for hooning. It is a serious issue in my electorate as well as others. It is dangerous, disruptive, and clearly something needs to be done, especially with repeat offenders.

The questions I asked on some of the parts - they can easily, no doubt, be answered - are on clause 5, section 14B amendment, which increases the penalty for trespass with an offence where a person is in possession of a firearm, up to three years imprisonment. I know in my division, there are a lot of shooters who apply for Crown licences. Bordering on the Crown properties are private properties - in acreage. We are not talking about just a few acres, we are talking about thousands. There are no boundaries; there are no fences. If they wander onto that land, unbeknown to them because there is no boundary, by this, they could be under 150 penalty units or with three years' imprisonment. That would be great if you get a bit of clarity on that part.

The amendment to clause 7, section 37 has an increase in penalty for destroying or injuring property offences goes to 12 months imprisonment or two years. Once again, where are the boundaries on that? You know, just a few lads coming home drunk, fall through a fence because they have drunk stupidly. It is up to an officer. Does he then charge them with that where there is then two years imprisonment? I know it is all down to what you think is common sense, but it is very subjective to the officer of the day when the offences occurs. Once again, if we can just get some clarity on that.

Otherwise, yes, I reiterate what other members have said. It would be great for me if I could get some answers on those parts.

POLICE OFFENCES AMENDMENT BILL 2025 (No. 7)

Second Reading

Resumed from above.
[2.30 p.m.]
Mr WOOD (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, as I was beginning to outline prior to the bell, the Police Offences Amendment Bill 2025 is a clear and comprehensive response to a growing public concern about antisocial and aggressive behaviour on our roads. Our community rightly expects that when someone chooses to endanger others, whether through reckless, threatening or violent driving, there are serious consequences. This bill delivers those consequences, but it does so in a considered, proportionate and indeed modern way.

We have all heard the stories. Many Tasmanians have experienced firsthand this escalation of road rage, hooning in residential streets, and vehicles being used to intimidate or harm.

Until now, police have had to rely on patching together other offences like negligent driving, property damage or common assault, which do not always reflect the full seriousness of the conduct or the trauma that is left in its wake. This bill introduces a specific offence for road rage. For the first time in Tasmania, it sends a message that this kind of violent conduct behind the wheel will not be tolerated or downplayed. Importantly, it gives our frontline police the powers they need to respond swiftly and appropriately when they see these incidents occur.

The new offence captures situations where a person drives or acts in a way that causes alarm, fear, distress or injury without reasonable excuse. This includes actions that lead to collisions, property damage, or threats, or where someone is plainly using their car to intimidate or harm others. It does not criminalise frustration or momentary lapses like a quick horn beep. It targets sustained, deliberate and dangerous conduct that puts lives at risk. The legislation reflects a reality seen by courts, police and victims. A car can be used as a weapon, and when it is, the law must treat it as such.

Just recently, a family travelling to Agfest was hunted down over a perceived slight. Their headlights were on high beam and they ended up in a very terrifying situation, with the car being rammed multiple times. The young children were extremely traumatised and their lives were in genuine danger. That offender received a custodial sentence, but only after being charged with multiple offences cobbled together. Under this bill, the core of the conduct 'road rage' would be directly used. This is a victim-centred reform. It recognises the psychological harm, the ripple effects on children and families, and the broader public safety risk posed by these behaviours.

Sadly, it is not just isolated cases. When the issue was put to the public, 86 per cent of Mercury readers said they had experienced some form of road rage. That statistic speaks to a broader cultural problem, one that requires a clear response from lawmakers.

Strengthening penalties across the board, this bill also delivers stronger penalties across a range of dangerous and high impact offences. For example, stealing a motor vehicle, a crime that often leads to further risks on road, will now attract a fine of up to $20,200, which is double the current amount. Hooning offences, burnouts, street racing, and sustained loss of traction will now carry up to six months imprisonment. Assault, property damage, and trespassing with firearms all see penalties increasing to bring Tasmania in line with other states and meet communities' expectations.

These are not symbolic changes; they are calibrated to reflect the real world impacts of these crimes on victims, families and the wider community.
The bill also enhances police powers to clamp and confiscate vehicles involved in hooning, dangerous driving or road rage incidents. Previously, officers had to personally witness the offence. Now, with these reforms, they can act on other credible forms of evidence such as dashcam footage, CCTV, or statements from witnesses. This is common sense. We asked the public to report hooning, but we need to give police the tools to act upon that information.

Periods of clamping and confiscation are also increasing. For a first offence it is up to three months. For a second, up to six months, and for third or further offences the vehicle can be forfeited to the Crown automatically, unless the driver owner successfully applies to the court. These steps reflect how seriously we take repeated dangerous offending on our roads.

The bill does not take a one-size-fits-all approach. Young people who commit road rage offences will be subject to the existing Youth Justice Act framework. Early intervention and diversion remain options for youth offenders where appropriate. The government continues to support a therapeutic and rehabilitative approach for young people, backed by the Youth Justice Blueprint of 2024-2034, but make no mistake, where public safety is at risk, consequences will follow.

This bill balances accountability with compassion. The bill also includes sensible reforms to reduce court time and, importantly, victim trauma. For example, in property offences or motor vehicle theft, the court will no longer require the victim to testify, only to confirm they did not give permission for their property to be damaged or stolen. This change mirrors approaches in other areas like liquor or consorting laws, and ensures the courts can focus on the core issues of the case.

Mobile phones are now explicitly defined as computers under the act for the purpose of computer-related offences. This change reflects how modern crime is committed and investigated. It ensures that when phones are used in scams, frauds or stalking offences, the law is keeping pace with the technology.

TasFarmers welcomed the bill's increase in penalties for destroying or injuring property or livestock, describing them as a step in the right direction. They went even further, suggesting that penalties should be further increased to act as a meaningful deterrent, especially in rural areas where armed trespass and livestock damage can be devastating. Their submission underscores how seriously property crimes affect not only the landholder, but families, employees and the broader food production sector.

This is not a bill that targets ordinary drivers. It targets dangerous behaviour, protects victims and equips police with the tools they need. Our message to the community is simple: if you respect the law, you have nothing to worry about, but if you threaten the safety of others on our roads, there will be consequences.

The Police Offences Amendment Bill 2025 is about prevention, deterrence and accountability. It reflects the values of society that place community safety first while still ensuring fairness and judicial discretions are maintained.

I urge members to support the bill.

[2.39 p.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak about the Police Offences Amendment Act, Bill 2025. I have some significant concerns about this bill. I do not support the doubling of penalties without any evidence as to why it is necessary, and that evidence has not been presented by the minister today.

My main concerns with this bill are that some of the clauses have the effect of eroding the presumption of innocence, something I expected Labor would try and protect. It does this by giving the police the power to clamp or confiscate vehicles in circumstances where the suspect is not found offending or caught red-handed, but where there is sufficient evidence for the police officer to reasonably believe the suspect has committed a prescribed offence. Make no mistake, the power to confiscate or clamp a vehicle is a punishment, and for some drivers it can have far-ranging and devastating consequences. The police should never be given the power to punish. It is only the judiciary who should have the power to punish. The separation of powers exists for a very good reason.

The clauses 14,15,16 and 21 all seek to give police the power to punish. I will elaborate on this in committee. I also have significant concerns about the new offence of road rage, which I will speak to further in committee.

My final concern is about the removal of judicial discretion to decide on the right punishment. Removal of judicial discretion, which clause 21 seeks to do, will lead to injustice. I will speak to that in more detail during the committee stage.

[2.41 p.m.]
Mr FERGUSON (Bass) -  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=12.1_D=24.0_C=0.73] Deputy Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to rise and briefly speak to this important legislation. I congratulate my friend and colleague, the minister for Police, for his initiative, focus, and proven dedication which, in my opinion, is unparalleled [Bookmark: Phr3_O=37.0_D=8.1_C=0.80]  in supporting our community to be a safe place, a place where people can go about their daily business not having to worry too much about what the law says. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=46.1_D=23.6_C=0.81]  They are focusing on their business, family, employment, the goals they have and their recreation. 

However, Tasmanians too often do need to think about the law and consider the matter we are discussing today because in some way their life has been disturbed by somebody else [Bookmark: Phr5_O=70.5_D=11.7_C=0.83]  who is not respecting the law and are creating a victim. They are hurting that person, they are interfering with their freedoms or they are driving dangerously in such way that [Bookmark: Phr6_O=84.4_D=19.0_C=0.69]  has worried, caused fear or, even worse, has caused a crash. 

The well-understood road toll is a nonpartisan issue. We all agree on the tragedy represented by those statistics. The road toll is not just the headline numbers of the tragedies of death caused by road crash in Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr7_O=103.9_D=29.9_C=0.79] . There are other serious injuries, the casualties, and I often think of them as the hidden road toll. It is those people whose lives have been damaged, their body or mind has been injured and they have to live with that, whether it is for a short time, supported with rehabilitation and they are able to [Bookmark: Phr8_O=134.0_D=2.9_C=0.75]  recover, or whether it is for their lifetime [Bookmark: Phr9_O=138.4_D=8.4_C=0.81] . Their ability to think about the way they want to live their life and make their decisions confidently has been permanently [Bookmark: Phr10_O=147.8_D=26.4_C=0.78]  disabled by the actions of another person on the road. 

While this bill deals with more things than hooning, I want to focus on that here today because that, for me, is one of the central initiatives in this legislation. For me, as Liberal member for Bass, it is about making sure that the posture of our law [Bookmark: Phr11_O=175.4_D=4.7_C=0.71]  is not too strong but is strong enough to send a message [Bookmark: Phr12_O=181.4_D=26.8_C=0.81]  to all of us who drive or are passengers in cars that we have a significant responsibility when we get behind the wheel of a motor vehicle, whether it is a car, motorcycle, truck or bus. There is a huge responsibility not just for my personal safety or the passengers in my vehicle, but for other people: the pedestrians, cyclists [Bookmark: Phr13_O=209.2_D=14.5_C=0.79] , other motorists and passengers in those other motor vehicles. We have a problem with hooning and road rage in Tasmania. I am pleased to say I do not see it an awful lot [Bookmark: Phr14_O=225.1_D=3.2_C=0.87] , but when we do see it, it is very serious.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=230.4_D=7.2_C=0.86] The first thing is for the law to send a clear message. Politicians and [Bookmark: Phr16_O=238.7_D=16.8_C=0.92]  men and women in blue will often talk about the deterrent effect, the deterrent value of legislation, which sends a chilling message to somebody thinking about breaking the law or being careless on the road: that if I get caught there is a serious penalty for me [Bookmark: Phr17_O=258.1_D=8.8_C=0.85] . For anybody, me included, just think about some of the things we got up to when we were younger. T [Bookmark: Phr18_O=267.8_D=23.3_C=0.86] here is that burning question in a person's mind: if the penalty is not very high, the disincentive from that wrong or illegal behaviour is small. If the penalty is increased, if society is telling me that if you are caught doing this, you are going to be in huge trouble, for most reasonable-thinking people [Bookmark: Phr19_O=292.8_D=11.8_C=0.76] , they will back away from that temptation to break the law and screw up. If we can get more of that deterrent value, particularly if it is communicated in plain English, in everyday language, we are able to create useful communications to the drivers of these motor vehicles.

I do not generalise about young people here at all.  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=21.0_D=9.9_C=0.78] People of all ages can be found to have offended in these different ways and I think we have all seen it. People of all ages can allow  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.8_D=12.0_C=0.92] their emotions to get the better of them when they are on the road. In my opinion, the best drivers on the road are the ones who are the least passionate, the ones focused on the task of driving [Bookmark: Phr4_O=44.8_D=1.1_C=0.75]  and not distracted by in-car entertainment or an illegally held mobile phone or the carrying on that might be occurring in your motor vehicle. Focusing on the task of driving is a critical responsibility. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=47.9_D=0.1_C=0.80]  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=67.8_D=14.6_C=0.63]  In my former role as minister for Transport, I often went out with people like Scott Tilyard from the Road Safety Advisory Council and we would often try to get these messages through to the community. Most people are doing the right thing most of the time, but as we all know, as humans we have our weaknesses. Being a focused, disciplined driver all the time is where our opportunity for safer roads lies.

I am sure it is the case that whenever there is a serious crash, it is not intended [Bookmark: Phr12_O=112.5_D=9.4_C=0.84] . We know that the biggest causes of road trauma in Tasmania are things that many of us think are not all that serious, like exceeding the speed limit by just a bit or by being distracted just for a moment. It is amazing how far a motor vehicle can travel in the time it takes to look at your mobile phone and read a text [Bookmark: Phr13_O=122.8_D=19.4_C=0.89] , and that is where the danger is for other road users.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=143.6_D=1.4_C=0.92] The law also needs to provide justice to victims when these offences do occur, as I said last week in a different debate. That is what the minister is bringing forward as well.  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=159.3_D=17.6_C=0.85] Have any of us, as MPs, spent time with a victim of crime? I am sure we have. Many of us can remember that victim of crime saying how cheated they felt when the punishment for the person guilty of the offence that caused them hurt [Bookmark: Phr17_O=179.0_D=3.8_C=0.91]  was very low.  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=185.1_D=14.7_C=0.85] There is that sense of not having been understood by the justice system at its different levels, whether it is a summary or indictable offence, Magistrates or Supreme Court. When the punishment seems so low  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=200.9_D=2.5_C=0.79] the sense of justice goes with it [Bookmark: Phr20_O=204.8_D=4.3_C=0.79] . This bill deals with that, and I am pleased it does.

 [Bookmark: Phr21_O=210.3_D=1.9_C=0.88] I applaud the new offence of road rage. [Bookmark: Phr22_O=213.5_D=20.5_C=0.85]  I applaud Tasmania Police, our minister and our government for introducing this to target that aggressive or irrational driving behaviour on our roads. There are other offences in the past that have been useful in this regard, but now we have a clear message. Police officers will be able to say to a person, 'I pulled you over and am now going to be taking you through a process in relation to the new offence of road rage.' I believe that is important. Schools, driving instructors and the Road Safety Advisory Council will be able to build new communications around this new offence of road rage [Bookmark: Phr23_O=235.3_D=29.0_C=0.82] . Even if there have been offences in the past that could have been used, having a new and  [Bookmark: Phr24_O=265.1_D=7.0_C=0.66] discreet offence gives the ability to have a fresh wave of communications  [Bookmark: Phr25_O=272.7_D=2.6_C=0.74] to people of all ages in all demographics  [Bookmark: Phr26_O=276.5_D=3.1_C=0.73] that we have to get control of our emotions behind the wheel of a car,  [Bookmark: Phr27_O=280.9_D=1.5_C=0.87] while sitting on a motorbike [Bookmark: Phr28_O=283.3_D=1.4_C=0.92]  or driving a truck.

 [Bookmark: Phr29_O=285.9_D=4.8_C=0.92]  [Bookmark: Phr30_O=292.9_D=6.1_C=0.74] A driver may well have reason to be angry. They have been cut off, maybe an illegal move, somebody moved in front of them, nearly caused a crash without indicating or ran a red light and nearly allided with my vehicle. There are good reasons why people could get angry behind the wheel of a car, but much better reasons to stay calm, and far stronger reasons to resist the urge to accelerate behind that car or to try to get back at them or back in front of them, or try to chase them down and menace them or target them aggressively or irrationally, as the bill describes.

I think it is terrific. I think that the new offence providing that specific provision may save some lives. We will probably never hear about the lives that might be saved by this, because that is how laws like this work in practice. If we can turn down the dial on some of the risk that does actually affect the lives of our Tasmanian community, we as MPs will have done our job.

In having a look at this issue, I had a look at a recent sentence. This is quite appropriate for me to share this with the House. It is from some sentencing comments that are, of course, a matter of public record and for a case that has been dealt with. In Mr Ellis's contribution, we heard about a 43-year-old man who was sentenced to three years' imprisonment in the Supreme Court. The reason I am bringing this forward, as the minister did, is because of what the sentencing judge referred to as a 'terrifying ordeal.' The comments painted a very concerning picture.

In summary, the court heard that what unfolded at this event, which was in May 2023, was a series of deliberate dangerous driving manoeuvres, including overtaking at speed and clipping the victim's car, blocking the way forward on the road, and trying to access the car. When this failed, the family's car - that is the victims' car - was attacked as they reversed and headed the other way. What ensued was the family being chased at speed. The offender continued by driving alongside them, colliding with the car, running them off the road into earthworks, and attempting to overtake them on double white lines.

I will not be mentioning anybody's names in relation to these sentencing comments. That does not serve the debate, but the comments themselves really do. I quote from the honourable Justice:

In short, the incident was one of what is commonly described as "road rage". At about 6.30am on 6 May 2023, the complainant -

Name removed here.

- was driving his 4WD vehicle in a northly direction on a gravel section of Ashby Road near Ross. He had his wife and their two children aged five years and 18 months in the car with him. They were travelling from Hobart to Agfest in Carrick and were doing so by way of back roads. At this time, the defendant was driving along Ashby Road in the opposite direction. He was driving a flat tray utility vehicle and was returning home to Ross after a camping trip. The two vehicles passed each other without any incident although the defendant is said to have had his headlights on high beam. Shortly after, the defendant turned his vehicle around and drove in a northerly direction behind [the complainant's] vehicle.

Each time I say, 'the complainant', I have removed the name.

The defendant came up behind with his headlights turned off. He then flashed his headlights and [the complainant] pulled over thinking something was wrong. The defendant continued to drive towards [the complainant's] vehicle flashing the headlights of his car and started to overtake it but in doing so clipped the rear of [the complainant's] vehicle. The defendant then drove ahead, slowed down, pulled to the left and turned the vehicle slightly sideways so it was in the middle of the road blocking it. At this point [the complainant] stopped. The defendant got out of his vehicle - 

Let us pause here for one moment. Imagine the fear in that victim's car right now. The atmosphere must have been very frightening. There is a family in this car.

The defendant got out of his vehicle and moved towards [the complainant's] vehicle waving his arms around. When he reached the driver’s side door, he tried to pull at the door handle at which point [the complainant] reversed away. As he did so, the defendant hit the front corner of the bonnet with his fist. The defendant returned to his vehicle and set off again in a northly direction. [The complainant] decided to turn his car around and travel in the other direction to avoid any further confrontation. 

About 10 minutes later, the defendant again drove up close behind [the complainant's] vehicle, this time at speed and again without the headlights on. After flashing his headlights, the defendant drove alongside the vehicle, scraped the side of it with the result that the passenger’s side mirror of his own vehicle was knocked off. [The complainant] stopped and so did the defendant, but he reversed towards the vehicle and [the complainant] drove backwards in retreat. By this time [the complainant's wife] had telephoned the police. The officer directed them to drive to Oatlands and [the complainant] very quickly drove in a southerly direction to get away from the defendant.

I want to emphasise this next part.

Shortly after he turned right onto the Midland Highway, the defendant again drove up close behind and then intentionally drove into the rear of [the complainant's] vehicle. He did this a total of seven times.

One would be bad enough. Seven times. I return to the quote:

The last contact pushed [the complainant's] vehicle off the road momentarily into gravel earthworks involving about a 30 centimetre drop from the road, but [the complainant] was able to recover the situation and continue to drive. The defendant started to overtake on two parallel white lines but desisted and when pulling back in, clipped the rear of [the complainant's] vehicle. He then stopped following them.

In addressing this behaviour, the honourable sentencing Justice went on to say:

… the acts of repeatedly driving into the back of [the complainant's] vehicle constitute a particular act of dangerous driving and those particulars also appear in the crime of assault.

…

The defendant effectively used his vehicle as a weapon in the assault.

If time permits, I may come back to that.

Plainly, factors of general deterrence and denunciation are prominent in the sentencing process. There is a need to deter others who may be tempted to behave in a similar way and the conduct needs to be completely condemned.

Clearly, this bill is designed to address serious behaviour. I will invite the minister in his summing up to share with the house what evaluation and review will be done on the commencement of the new offence provisions so that we can make sure that in future, if it needs some fine tuning, that can be done as well. I really hope this law reform will work. It probably will not affect a lot of people much of the time, but where it is a particular nuisance, I hope it will help to curb that behaviour, and that all of us, whether we have been driving for decades or just a few months, continue to have a greater sense of responsibility, not just for myself and my passengers, but more importantly for other road users who are trying to get about their business.

This idea that a person driving a one- or two-tonne vehicle or more - in the wrong hands they are actually driving a weapon, just as the sentencing judge has outlined. If we can see this law reform turn around some of that mischief behaviour, it is almost certainly going to lead to less road crashes and less injuries, and I hope it will lead to less road deaths in Tasmania.

I commend the minister and the team behind it for their initiative. I thank them for bringing it to the House and, of course, I strongly support it.

[3.00 p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to provide a short contribution on the Police Offences Amendment Bill 2025, the bill dealing with new offences and matters such as road rage, increased penalties, clamping and confiscation, and some definitional work which includes a greater range of devices, et cetera. I think the bill overall probably reflects a sad moment in our community. We are seeing so many more - in particular, when you are dealing with road rage, we are seeing a large increase in that kind of antisocial behaviour. Is it the fact that we are seeing it now more often because of social media, or the fact that it can be on social media? People are engaging in these kinds of anti-social forms of behaviour violent, either verbally or physically, using their cars and acting in a really aggressive and unwarranted and uncalled for way, and we are seeing a lot more of it.

I think that normalising it via social media and people glorifying it via social media potentially has had an impact on the increase in occurrences in our community. I think we have all seen elements of people sitting in their car and saying a few choice words, and that is one thing, but acting in a more aggressive way - drivers using their vehicle to force people off the road, or following people or tailgating or that sort of aggressive driver behaviour, it is really disappointing that we have to come to this place and change some laws to respond to that.

At the end of the day, as this place has debated in previous weeks, if community behaviour changes and changes in a way which impacts on law-abiding citizens going about their day-to-day duties, we have an obligation to respond. In part, the new offence of road rage deals with that. I am broadly supportive, although these things are always a balance. We will see how that that new offence is used and interpreted by the court. This place, and broadly the community, will be seeing how the courts respond to this new offence.

In terms of clamping and confiscation, I welcome that. It is not something that a number of years ago I may have looked at, but having sat down in lounge rooms and chatted over cups of tea with people who live in communities where hooning occurs, the impact on their life and the impact on their mental health is significant.

Deputy Speaker, you and I both represent a community that has been impacted significantly by this. I think it is colloquially known as the 'Bradman nats' - a part of our community where if you look at the street, you struggle to actually find a section of the road that has not been impacted by burnouts and outrageous behaviour. Young kids and families living in quiet cul-de-sacs and normally quiet streets are impacted by this kind of behaviour. The impact on their life and mental health is significant and detrimental.

If they complain, they are fearful of reprisals. For those people who engage in this behaviour, I know at times it almost becomes ritualistic. If there has been an untimely death in the community, some people feel that this is a way to honour those who have passed. I am in sympathy with the sentiment behind it, but I cannot be in any way sympathetic to the behaviour and how that impacts people who live in the streets where this occurs or in communities where this regularly happens.

Giving Tasmania Police a greater ability to clamp and to confiscate. - I think this is a reasonable response to what is an unreasonable act by elements of our community. I absolutely support that. For those people who have been calling for change and calling for help, effectively, over the last couple of years, if this bill passes this place and the other, then hopefully action can be swiftly taken to send a message and to respond. 

We know Tasmania Police cannot be everywhere on every street corner at every moment of the day, but a greater level of powers and having a different setting in terms of what is required to allow them to confiscate and to clamp gives Tasmania Police more powers to hopefully curb this kind of behaviour where they are able to get and provide the evidence required.

I support those elements of the bill, purely to give peace of mind to those people who live in streets where this occurs. I cannot imagine kids hearing that kind of stuff sometimes spreading onto their front lawn and trying to get to school the next morning and trying to learn and educate themselves, and people trying to get up to go to work as well after a night of this kind of hooning behaviour. It is just outrageous.

With regard to the increased penalties, penalties in this case do not actually act as a deterrent. Increasing penalties for certain crimes is reasonable because it acts as a deterrent when it is a conscious act, when people understand, but in some respects some of the increased penalties are class-based attacks or initiatives, and they could potentially cause greater community and civil disruption to communities with this kind of cohort that engage in this kind of behaviour.

It does not act as a deterrent; what it may well do is entrench disadvantage and poverty and potentially make it harder to break the cycle of crime, behaviour and consequence of certain offenders. I am not sure if it fixes it. I understand that the courts will form views on the range of penalties that apply and it is up to the courts to do that, so there is no mandatory element of this, but if you think increasing penalties and consequence and conviction for these kind of offences acts as a deterrent, you are wrong.

You do the crime, you do the time - I am not against that, but in the vast majority of cases, when people undertake this they are not thinking of the consequences of what happens if they get caught. They are in the moment and in the action, and I am sceptical about that and concerned about the increased penalties. 

The new offence of road rage is important given the change in community behaviour; the clamping and confiscation element is important because of the dangers and some of the impacts that members of my community have suffered because of certain behaviour, so the greater powers in that area make sense. The other matters that are dealt with are okay to go through.

I think I have made my points on this one. I understand we might be going into committee. I am not sure if that is the case or not; I have not seen any amendments go around.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr Garland indicated that he wanted to go into committee on this bill.

Mr O'BYRNE - I look forward to that debate and we will see how we go.

[3.09 p.m.]
Mr ELLIS (Braddon - Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Management) - Deputy Speaker, I appreciate the contributions of other members here today on what is an important matter when it comes to keeping our community safe. I understand the emotion in the room, particularly those who have spoken about people who have been victims of these kinds of offences and this kind of behaviour, and I am really grateful to them for giving voice to victims in this place. 

I will work through a range of different questions that were asked by colleagues. Hopefully my responses capture them thematically and provide the answers that are being sought. 

I was asked to clarify whether motorbikes or motorised pushbikes are included in the definition of a vehicle. The answer is yes. Vehicle includes motorbikes and petrol-powered bicycles. Amendments late last year through the Department of State Growth now mean, for example, that a bicycle fitted with an internal combustion engine - people will know these as lawnmower engines et cetera - is now a motor vehicle and therefore they need to be road compliant and registered.

There was an enforcement moratorium and police began enforcing these new laws on 1 January 2025, and other motorbikes as well. Some of the most dangerous hooning that you see is by people operating a motorbike.

I was asked questions about whether doubling penalty units will bring down crime rates. Doubling penalties [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=30.0_C=0.74]  is designed to acknowledge the seriousness of the offence. It also bridges the gap between the penalties that are available to a magistrate in the lower courts and those available in the Supreme Court. For example, the current trespass maximum penalty is 100 penalty units and two years' imprisonment. However, the Acts Interpretation Act 1931 provides for penalties of up to three years before they become indictable, so there is a 12-month gap between penalties. Increasing the maximum [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.4_D=25.8_C=0.74]  penalty for trespass with a firearm is congruent with the serious nature of the offending. The three years closes that gap between those two jurisdictions. 

Doubling penalties was also included in our election commitments to make our communities safer and our roads safer, and to reflect the fact that unsafe driving on our roads is unacceptable. We promised to do it and we are delivering. There are many reasons why [Bookmark: Phr4_O=87.1_D=1.2_C=0.95]  the justice system  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=90.2_D=1.2_C=0.47]  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=91.8_D=30.0_C=0.78] operates. There has been a lot of talk about deterrence today and the importance of penalties for deterrence, but there are a whole range of other reasons why we seek to bring about justice: obviously punishment, to punish a person in a way that is just; rehabilitation, to help a person change their behaviour so that they do not commit an offence again; deterrence of course, which we know; denunciation, to express in a formal, public way that the person's behaviour is unacceptable to the community [Bookmark: Phr7_O=121.9_D=16.2_C=0.89] ; and protection, to keep the community safe. 

When we are talking about repeat offenders who continue to offend against the community in these ways, an increase in penalties allows us to protect the community [Bookmark: Phr8_O=138.4_D=26.6_C=0.84]  because of those increased penalties. It gets these hoons off our streets and out of the community. It gets people who, for example, would commit an aggravated common assault against a pregnant woman. It ensures that that person is able to be taken out of the community and those who would be put at risk are protected. 

Even from the Greens last week, we saw the interesting irony [Bookmark: Phr9_O=165.9_D=2.4_C=0.64]  that their Custodial Inspector Bill proposed [Bookmark: Phr10_O=168.9_D=28.8_C=0.86]  a two-year imprisonment penalty as well as a 240-penalty-unit fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both, for the offence, which could include:

A person must not - 

…

(c)	do any act that is, or likely to be, to the detriment of; 

…

another person because the other person has provided, is providing, or may in the future provide information,  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=198.6_D=6.0_C=0.55] whether true or false, to the Inspector, or an officer of the Inspector, for the purposes of this Act. 

Two years' imprisonment [Bookmark: Phr12_O=204.9_D=29.8_C=0.83]  from the Greens on that matter, when we are talking about the potential threat to life and safety of a person physically, including assaulting a pregnant woman, is a strange argument to be making in the context of what we saw last week.

I was asked how many fines become monetary penalty fines. It is unknown, although there are avenues for payment plans through the Fines Enforcement Unit. The court can only [Bookmark: Phr13_O=234.9_D=30.0_C=0.77]  legislatively give 28 days to pay a fine. We do not have an analysis of how many fines upon conviction are converted to the MPES debts, but fines are due within 28 days and parties may seek time through the MPES process for time to pay. The Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management does not administer the process so I cannot give you further information on that one at this time.

I was asked to clarify whether the doubling of fines and imprisonment means that this is mandatory. I will note that this House has recently passed some presumptive mandatory sentencing matters, so obviously there has been a change in position on the other side of the House, but I will say in this particular context, there are no mandatory minimum sentences. All the government has done is to seek to increase the maximum. The court will still have the discretion in sentencing [Bookmark: Phr15_O=292.8_D=7.6_C=0.70] . The rationale for increasing penalties is threefold: it indicates the seriousness of the offending; it closes the gap in the sentencing range, which I mentioned before, between [Bookmark: Phr16_O=300.7_D=4.2_C=0.69]  the Magistrate's Court and the Supreme Court, essentially meaning that the maximum penalty in the Magistrates Court will now, for the selective offence, align with the Acts Interpretation Act 1931. Thirdly, there needs to be some risk analysis and considerations, particularly where there is some intent or premeditation to commit the offence, as opposed to offences that are dynamic and unfold in real time, potentially  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=26.0_D=10.5_C=0.51] regarded as opportunistic.

It is also important to note that it better aligns with other jurisdictions penalties. I did note Mr O'Byrne's contribution on it. It is sad that we are seeing this increase and that we are seeing some concerns that mirror some other jurisdictions. I associate myself with those comments too. We want to make sure that we continue to be the safest place to live, work and raise a family. It is important that we take strong action.

I was asked about fines in relation to family violence where an animal is harmed. I hope I have the summary of what you are seeking there correct.  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=70.3_D=30.0_C=0.76] The adding of violence directed towards an animal or a pet as part of the definition of family violence is an important and recent amendment to the Family Violence Act 2004. I think I acknowledged Mr O'Byrne in that particular matter from memory - that is family violence when it relates to pets.

Mr O'Byrne - Yes.

Mr ELLIS - This definition change empowers the police to act on more instances where family violence is perpetrated. There is no change to offences under the Animal Welfare Act 1993. It is a very new amendment to the Family [Bookmark: Phr6_O=100.4_D=8.2_C=0.71]  Violence Act 2004 so it is too early for any quantitative data that I can share. It is certainly an important change.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=109.7_D=6.6_C=0.65] I was asked why I changed the power of seizures for a hooning offence from 'when it is found offending' to  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=118.1_D=19.7_C=0.80] 'reasonable grounds'. We have changed 'found offending' to 'reasonable grounds to believe', meaning police are currently limited to responding to a hooning incident only when the offender and vehicle are found offending. The police must catch the offender in the act.  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=138.2_D=29.7_C=0.82] By moving to 'reasonable grounds to believe', this means that the police can be informed by evidence that is more readily available, such as dashcam footage, CCTV, or a corroborating witness account. When the community report hooning to the police, they expect police to investigate when there is supporting evidence to act. I can tell you from the constituents I have spoken to the frustration, which is very deep and very real, with the limitations of the existing legislation in that space, particularly when we regularly ask our community to provide evidence and to report through the portal and they have that available. When there are limitations, that is deeply frustrating to the community [Bookmark: Phr10_O=168.3_D=15.6_C=0.86]  who want action taken on these dangerous matters.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=184.3_D=29.7_C=0.79] I was asked about forfeiture orders and to clarify whether a court must make a forfeiture order and whether that means it is mandatory. Yes, in this case it is mandatory, but only for a third or subsequent offence. That is no different from the 'special penalty $600 for clamped and confiscated vehicles'. There are several reasons that an order must be made to facilitate the disposal of the vehicle [Bookmark: Phr12_O=214.2_D=28.4_C=0.80] , such as vehicles that are at the lower end or valueless, where the offender rarely seeks to collect or retain possession. Often the owner/operator is unable to be ascertained. The feedback that we have received from Tasmania Police's road policing unit cite the nature of the market, whereby the sale, swap or other trade of those vehicles further adds to difficulty in identifying an owner or an operator. These offenders are unlikely to transfer registration with Service Tasmania  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=242.7_D=26.8_C=0.84] as required for any change of ownership. Where a vehicle is of value, for example, a hoon took their grandmother's car, there will be an interest in recouping these vehicles. In that circumstance, there is often representation during the court proceedings.

Fourth, they are advised of legislative framework at the time of clamping or confiscation [Bookmark: Phr14_O=270.2_D=3.8_C=0.75] . Where a motor vehicle is clamped or confiscated, required paperwork is  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=275.0_D=29.7_C=0.89] served on the offender or registered operator, as the case may be. There are 14 calendar days for a person who has an interest in the vehicle to seek the return of the vehicle. That is not unreasonable. With this in mind, the 14 day period is simply to lodge the application.

Another example is where the court disqualifies a person from driving for any period. Legislation requires lodgement of an application for a restricted licence to be made within 21 days. Parallels can be drawn with the proposed amendment in that there is no secrecy about the proceedings, for example, and that the register, operator or owner is aware of the vehicle clamping or confiscation. I am happy to work through those matters. Forfeiture, obviously, is for a third and subsequent offence for the offender.

I was asked about the human rights and due diligence as it relates to the 14 day for forfeiture question. The advice from Department of Police, Fire and Emergency (DPFEM) is extending the period from the proposed 14 days to 28 days. If proposed, I am happy to work through with the House about what we see as acceptable there. We have spoken about other precedents in other parts of the law. Obviously, this would allow more time for people who have access barriers to justice to seek assistance. I am open to that conversation.

I was asked about driver behaviour causing forfeiture. Upon conviction for a third or subsequent offence, it is the vehicle that was seized as a result of that hooning offence that is subject to the forfeiture, unless ordered for return by the court following an application on the basis of severe hardship.

I was asked about the increasing penalties not being a solid deterrent and that they could have a disproportionate impact on low incomes. That was particularly asked by Ms Badger. We have spoken before about the Greens' legislative amendment that literally happened last week in this regard, so they obviously believe in increasing penalties in some contexts.

There are also several sentencing options available under the Sentencing Act. Fines are not mandatory; courts must always be able to consider the unique circumstances of the offence and the offender in these matters. Options include the following, from Section 7 of the Sentencing Act 1997:

A court that finds a person guilty of an offence may … :

(a)	record a conviction and order that the offender serve a term of imprisonment; or

(ab)	… make a drug treatment …

(b)	… order that the offender serve a term of imprisonment that is wholly or partly suspended; or

(c)	… make a home detention order …

(d)	… make a community correction order …

(e)	… order the offender to pay a fine; or

…

(f)	adjourn the proceedings for a period … on the offender giving an undertaking with conditions attached, …

(g)	… discharge of the offender; or

(h)	… order the dismissal of the charge for the offence; or

(i)	impose any other sentence or make any order, or any combination of orders …

There is a lot of flexibility there, is what I am trying to say.

There was a question of whether a new offence is a surprise. We are looking to cut red tape, but this is about matters of community safety as it relates to criminals. Red tape is something that all law-abiding citizens experience in their lives. When people are not following the law and are recklessly endangering other people, we make no apologies for taking tough action. Further, the fact that we are proposing a new offence of road rage should not be a surprise. It was proposed by the government during the election campaign, spoken about a lot, and also made clear when the department went into public consultation.

DPFEM publishes significant policy matters and proposed bills on their website. DPFEM can only consider feedback from those community members and organisations who make a submission. This is particularly in regard to a lot more focus in those submissions on knife crime as opposed to the hooning matters. It is not possible to consider these views that are not shared with the agency during the consultation process. We do have significant feedback from the community that they expect us to take action when it comes to road rage, keeping them safe, and hooning and assault matters.

There was a question regarding the statistic showing career car thieves. We know we have a significant problem with recidivist offenders in Tasmania. A very large proportion of our crimes are committed by a small number of people. Indeed, in our recent Hobart CBD retailer community safety forum, it was discussed that in certain crimes, 10 per cent of offenders commit 60 per cent of the offences. There are recidivist offenders who regularly appear before the court. There are also opportunistic offenders who come across conditions suitable for offending. Data is not readily available in that particular matter regarding motor vehicle theft, although I can say that in a broader sense, recidivist offenders commit a large number of crimes. That is why we committed to making our dedicated strike forces that target recidivist offenders permanent. It is disappointing that the Greens' alternative budget proposes to remove funding for those strike forces.

On section 37, I think Mr Garland asked why it shifts from court evidence to police power and reasonable grounds. I will say no on forfeiture. There still needs to be a court conviction. The court must be satisfied that the charge has been established and sentence in full appreciation of the legislative requirements surrounding the forfeiture of vehicles. You seem to believe that it would be a matter that police could decide. However, it is a matter that the courts decide.

I was asked what is 'reasonable belief'. Reasonable belief is a well-established principle and threshold to activate an authority and is expressed across the Police Offences Act and other acts for the policing of offences. It is not possible for the parliament to prescribe every piece of evidence that may inform an officer's belief when they are investigating and gathering evidence. Reasonable belief is not a guess. It is not a suspicion. It has to be informed by evidence that is cogent, admissible and tested against other evidence that may further corroborate an offence or actually inform that an offence has not occurred. Police officers are trained in gathering evidence that will inform their belief. This amendment will allow police to gather evidence, as they do for other offence types, be informed by that evidence and then, when appropriate, act to seize an offending vehicle and commence proceedings against a hooning offender. It is a well-established part of law.

I was asked whether this is about improving community safety or is simply political. It is about improving community safety. The members of our community I know personally speak with passion about their desire to be safe on their roads and their children to be safe on their roads; about people who have been assaulted in public places. The thought that this House would be so cynical as to consider increasing penalties against pregnant women as a question of, 'Is it political or is it about keeping the community safe?' is on the wrong track. I believe everyone can agree that we should be protecting the community, that people should be held accountable for their actions and that there should be real consequences. The fact we are aligning our laws more closely with the penalties we see in other jurisdictions shows that others have had these thoughts before us, and that it is important for us to act.

We make no apologies for being tough on crime. It was encouraging to hear the support of the crossbench, opposition and others for the tough-on-crime agenda. I understand that has been a long journey for a few, but it is important that we have reached that point.

Road rage is real. It has a real impact on innocent members of our community. Many of the crimes when it comes to hooning, motor vehicle stealing and road rage can escalate from a crime that simply harms someone's property or scares someone into a very serious offence because vehicles are deadly weapons when they are in the wrong hands. We have spoken about some of the newspaper polling about the experience people have had with road rage and other matters when it comes to safety on our roads. The bill sends a clear message to those who commit road rage and similar offences that it is completely unacceptable. We took the policy to an election and we are delivering on it. We are looking to ensure that there are significant consequences for those who put people and property in danger. We make no apologies for throwing the book at those who do so.

Innocent Tasmanians who do the right thing on our roads can have their lives changed in an instant by hooning and reckless drivers. The bill is the first step in saving lives and protecting the community from those who believe they are above the law.

Mr Jenner, who I understand is watching online, mentioned that there were concerns regarding subjective application of road rage, word-on-word complaints and trespass. In terms of road rage there is protection from minor or fleeting matters being regarded as an offence because the construction of the offence requires the person 'accused of committing the offence' to have known that their course of conduct would result in the listed outcome. For the complaining party, that person alone saying they felt alarm, distress, apprehension or fear is not enough. This construction of the offence requires guilty knowledge on the part of the accused, or that they ought to have known. There is no interest in pursuing matters that are minor, fleeting or trifling. These matters are not sufficient to establish the offence.

Further, Tasmanian police officers are expected to exercise discretion for matters of a minor nature. We have all had an experience like that, I am sure, where a driver may express brief frustration at another driver's error or indiscretion. This will not establish the road rage offence, and Mrs Beswick's family can rest easy. I know people like that in my family as well. It is a good way to keep safe, I suppose, when you make that assumption about other people's capacities. However, it is important that when matters are minor in nature, we have the ability to exercise discretion, and it is expected.

As with all matters where Tasmania Police elect to charge a person with an offence, the arbiter of this matter is our independent court system. I stress that again for Mr Garland and other people in this place.

There were concerns about matters being pursued for a word-on-word type of complaint, which is where one person complains of an offence and the other states they are innocent of such an allegation. To consider laying a complaint, police must have a prima facie case - that is, on the gathering of all evidence, it appears a case is made out. Police cannot institute proceedings for word of one person versus word of another person without police being satisfied that the charge is made out on the available evidence. It is the seeking out of corroborating evidence and being informed by the evidence that informs police about the strength of the case and if seizure of a vehicle and commencing proceedings is warranted on that available evidence. It is part of the reason why it is so important in this legislation that we give police the capacity to bring in other evidence as part of the process so that it can be proved in a court of law one way or another.

Concerns were raised in relation to trespass, particularly with a firearm, and whether a member of the community might find themselves charged with trespass for crossing over or entering into the wrong land by mistake. The offence of trespass allows for a person to have a reasonable or lawful excuse to be on land before trespass is made out. The act states in 14B in the unlawful entry of land, et cetera:

A person, without reasonable or lawful excuse (proof of which lies on the person), must not enter into or onto, move into or onto, or remain in or on, any land, building, structure, premises, aircraft, vehicle or vessel, without the consent of the owner, occupier or person in charge of the land, building, structure, premises, aircraft, vehicle or vessel.

The key is at the start - 'a person without reasonable or lawful excuse'. The offence of trespass allows for an honest and reasonable mistake of fact. Where a person may be on forestry land, for example, or on an adjoining farming property and, by mistake, wanders across a property boundary onto another person's land, the offence of trespass is not made out.

The same applies where a person may enter onto land believing they have permission to be on that land, but it turns out they entered onto the wrong land by error. This is why police officers are trained to not arrest for trespass until a person has been spoken to about why they are on the property, have been provided with an opportunity to provide an explanation and then, if appropriate, a direction to leave.

In the absence of some other criminal culpability being demonstrated, it is only when a person refuses to leave that trespass is made out and arrest may be considered by the police. The risk of a person being charged for trespass who has made a genuine mistake of fact is extremely remote, and all police prosecution matters are internally reviewed before progressing to the court.

Labor asked me to clarify the separate trespass provisions. This offence now stands alone for sentencing purposes to acknowledge the unique and serious nature of this particular offending. During the public consultation phase, TasFarmers provided input supporting the increase in penalties for trespass with a firearm. They said that in their opinion, the maximum penalties should recognise the criminality [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=29.8_C=0.83]  of trespass with a firearm which occurs in regional areas where communities are more vulnerable, particularly because we are talking about someone's farm being their home. 

To trespass into someone's living room with a firearm is a very serious matter. Our farmers feel similarly about their property. I acknowledge the minister for Primary Industries for her strong support of our farmers and advocacy in regard to this matter. Trespass [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.7_D=26.7_C=0.64]  with a firearm is an aggravating factor to the offence of trespass. For this reason, the sentencing for trespass with a firearm has been increased. However, the elements of trespass in section 14B must still be made out.

Finally, Mr Garland mentioned that it gives police the power to punish. I have already dealt with this. Reasonable grounds to seize must be informed by the evidence, and that is a legislative threshold based in law. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=88.4_D=2.4_C=0.86]  I spoke about the removal of judicial discretion [Bookmark: Phr5_O=91.2_D=30.0_C=0.84] ; I have already dealt with it. Judicial discretion is not removed. A person can make application for a vehicle to be returned based on hardship and the magistrate can decide to quash a forfeiture order and return the vehicle to the owner who may be subject to hardship. 

What it does is improve the management of the numerous - and can I say, numerous - seized and often unwanted or valueless vehicles, and reduce the administrative impost and delay to the court. Mrs Beswick spoke very well about the importance [Bookmark: Phr6_O=121.2_D=25.5_C=0.83]  of our court system, and some of those forfeiture processes, working more efficiently. That is going to be a good thing for everybody, including the taxpayer. Even before a court matter concludes, an inspector of police can return a vehicle where hardship is demonstrated.

I thank all the members of the House for their contributions.

Bill read the second time.


 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=148.1_D=5.1_C=0.46] POLICE OFFENCES AMENDMENT BILL 2025 (No. 7)

In Committee
 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=154.2_D=8.3_C=0.59]  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=166.6_D=11.2_C=0.73] 
 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=199.8_D=8.9_C=0.53] Clauses 1 to 8 agreed to.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=213.2_D=3.0_C=0.57] Clause 9 -
Section 37FA inserted
	37FA. Road rage

Mr GARLAND - I rise to speak about the creation of the new offence of road rage. It is clear that clause 9, subsection (1)(b), where the conduct results in:

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=236.4_D=6.8_C=0.70] damage to property; or

injury to a person; or

a collision with another vehicle; or 

a risk of danger to a person;

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=245.4_D=7.9_C=0.87] These are all situations where police could lay charges under existing legislation and existing offences, all of which carry more serious penalties.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=254.2_D=8.5_C=0.76] The example the minister has chosen to highlight in his second reading speech is an example that was adequately dealt with under existing legislation. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=263.6_D=16.4_C=0.87]  If the minister wants to provide legislative recognition of the serious impacts of road rage incidents to the victim and the public, he should legislate to make road rage an aggravating circumstance which warrants a greater penalty. It does not need to be made a new offence to achieve this.

 [Bookmark: Phr21_O=282.6_D=12.7_C=0.77] This is what New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia have all done. In those states, road rage has been made an aggravating circumstance in legislation. In Western Australia and Queensland there is no separate offence of road rage.

 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=296.1_D=8.5_C=0.76] Returning to the bill at hand, it is only if the result is that set out in subsection (1)(b)(v), which are not covered by existing offence provisions where alarm, distress, apprehension or fear are caused to the victim. My objection is not so much with penalising those results. My concern is with the conduct that this seeks to penalise, as set out in subsection (2)(a). We are talking about penalising offensive or profound gestures and profane or insulting words. This is minor stuff. I am not talking about tailgating and then pulling up next to someone and threatening to kill them. A course of conduct like this might warrant the creation of a separate offence, but that is not what has been presented to the parliament.

According to the bill before us today, an offence could be committed by simply honking your horn a few times or swearing at another driver in the heat of the moment because they almost caused an accident. Just because a person is in their car when they make offensive or profane gestures or utter profane or insulting words, because of this new offence they face the risk of having their vehicle clamped or confiscated for three months if it is their first offence, or six months or 12 months or longer if they have been previously convicted of prescribed offences previously.

This offence, as currently drafted, casts a very broad net for conduct which can lead, or will lead, if this act is passed, to the ability to clamp or confiscate a car and arrest a person without a warrant.

I sought advice from the department as to what other jurisdictions have created this offence. I was told that it was only New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia. In New South Wales, the offence provision is against the Road Transport Act 2013, section 118. A person must not drive a motor vehicle on a road in a manner that menaces another person if the person ought to have known that the other person might be menaced.

'Menaces' generally requires a victim to perceive the threat of harm and for the driver to ought to have known the victim would feel threatened by their behaviour. The identical provision applies in the Australian Capital Territory: section 8 of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999. Both in the Australian Capital Territory and New South Wales, the offence provisions make clear that the threat to the victim needs to be related to damage to their property or to injure them. Both of these offences have been criminalised in those jurisdictions for more than a decade. In other words, this is not a new problem.

Western Australia does not have a separate offence of road rage as such. Rather, it is seen as an aggravating circumstance that can accompany offences of damaging property or assault, which can result in an order for confiscation of the offender's vehicle, or driving dangerously. Queensland and New South Wales have explicitly included it as an aggravating factor in their sentencing legislation. The advantage of this is that it enables the parliament to express to the judiciary that this is an aggravating feature of offending.

There is an important protection in the New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory offence provisions that is lacking here, which is that in order to meet the threshold of a criminal offence it must be capable of causing the victim to apprehend a threat of personal injury or damage to their property. Driving past another driver and gesticulating or shouting would not meet this threshold in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, and nor should it here.

This offence is drafted far too broadly. That was the view of Tasmania Legal Aid. On its own it might not be so objectionable, but because it will become an offence to which mandatory sentencing can apply and an offence to which police will be given power to clamp or confiscate a vehicle in circumstances where they have been provided only with the statement of a complainant, the parliament should oppose the creation of this offence.

Mr ELLIS - I thank Mr Garland for his questions. I first reiterate that this is not mandatory sentencing, which is important to clarify.

I was asked about different states' approaches to road rage. Our approach was determined after analysing all of these approaches. For the specific offence, another point that is often made is that a specific charge of road rage ensures that a person's criminal history reflects the severity of the conduct. It is important that we know exactly how bad it was, which may not be readily apparent if there was a series of lesser charges. That is important to highlight. When Mr Ferguson spoke he cited a Supreme Court judge's comments on sentencing, and he actually used the term 'road rage' to describe the course or the pattern of offending.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.8_D=4.7_C=0.58] A 2019 study from the Monash University Accident Research Centre (MUARC) - of course, we call them crashes these days - showed that aggressive driving is a problem on Australian roads. The MUARC said driver aggression manifests in deliberate behaviours and increases the crash risk both for the offender and other road users.  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=56.3_D=4.3_C=0.60]  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=61.1_D=24.1_C=0.81] In its conclusion, the centre states that law enforcement with specific regulations or law enforcement programs targeting aggressive driving is likely to be an effective strategy for changing attitudes. 

Further academic qualification is offered by a University of Western Australia (UWA) paper that found that driving-related violence is linked to experiences  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=86.4_D=7.0_C=0.79] of aggression, and therefore strategies that focus purely on education, information and anger management  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=93.7_D=30.0_C=0.76] are not likely to be effective. That is page 376 for those playing along. UWA further remarked that new laws dealing specifically with this kind of driver behaviour 'would be effective and will aid in acknowledging this unlawful behaviour'.

Finally, the Criminology Research Centre of Australia found that due to offender trait factors - and they refer to impulsive violence - criminal sanctions and clinical interventions  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=124.1_D=29.7_C=0.85] are of more value than public education and improved road systems, although it is important that we do both. It is important to note that in the absence of mandatory penalties there are sentencing options for the court.

The example just given with regard to gesticulating not being an offence in New South Wales will not be included in this bill either. There is protection from minor or fleeting matters being regarded as an offence because the construction of  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=153.9_D=29.7_C=0.75] the offence requires, and I have spoken about this before, that the person accused of committing the offence knows or ought to have known that the course of their conduct would result in the listed outcomes. For the complaining party, that person alone saying that they felt alarmed, distress, apprehension or fear is not enough. This construction of the offence requires guilty knowledge on the part of the accused or that they ought to have known. 

As I mentioned before, there is no interest in pursuing matters that are minor, fleeting or trifling. These matters are not sufficient to establish the offence. Further, Tasmania Police officers are of course expected to exercise discretion for matters of a minor nature where a driver may express brief frustration at another driver's error or indiscretion.  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=199.8_D=10.0_C=0.79] This will not establish the road rage offence. As with all matters where Tasmania Police elect to charge a person with an offence, the arbiter of the matter is our independent court system.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=211.6_D=0.5_C=0.30] Clause 9 agreed to.

Clause 10 to 13 agreed to.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=229.0_D=3.1_C=0.26]  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=234.3_D=1.5_C=0.66]  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=236.6_D=14.3_C=0.42] Clause 14 -
Section 37O amended (Period of clamping or confiscation for first prescribed offence)

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=260.2_D=24.0_C=0.78] Mr GARLAND - I need to make the point because it seems to have been lost on Labor. Clause 14 does not assist the police to prove a charge. The effect of this amendment is to enable police to go around clamping and confiscating cars where they have reasonable grounds for believing that a person has committed a prescribed offence. It enables police to take certain actions which are akin to punishment before the alleged defending has been dealt with by the court.  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=285.1_D=19.8_C=0.86] It does not make it easier for them to gather evidence or to prove that a person has committed a prescribed offence. 

Make no mistake, clamping is a punishment and a substantial one at that. In many cases it will have flow-on consequences for the defendant, including their employment, particularly in Tasmania where we are so poorly served by public transport, and particularly for those in regional areas. Take away their car and you take away their employment, and potentially their only means to access medical assistance or schools for their kids. It is not only offenders this impacts, it is also potentially the family members, the children, or other dependents who are impacted by clamping and confiscation.

Currently, in order to punish a person by confiscating or clamping their vehicle, the law requires the police to find the defendant in the act of committing the offence, with very good reason. If you want to give police the power to punish a person rather than the court, you want to make sure police only exercise this power where there can be no doubt that it is warranted.

What this amendment seeks to achieve is to reduce the level of certainty the officer needs before implementing this punishment. It is worth remembering that a pillar of our criminal justice system is the presumption of innocence. A court must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt based on admissible evidence it receives before it can find a person guilty and proceed to punish the offender. What the police are seeking is to be able to impose a punishment on a suspect in circumstances where they hold a reasonable belief that the suspect committed a prescribed offence. This is a lower standard of proof, or, to put it another way, a lower standard of certainty, before an officer can impose this punishment.

Chair, I want to explain how this plays out in practice. According to data reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, for the most recent year reported, 2022-23, only 83 per cent of those charged and appearing in the Magistrates Court were found guilty. This is almost one in every five people charged and appearing in the Magistrates Court were found not guilty or had their charges dismissed. These are people for whom the police decided there were reasonable grounds to charge them, but who were ultimately found, for whatever reason, not guilty of those charges. Based on these figures alone, this Parliament should be very wary of effectively handing police the power to punish a person for an offence by being able to confiscate or clamp their car simply because they believe there is sufficient evidence to charge them. Based on the data from the Australian Bureau of Statistic, (ABS), almost one in five of those people will ultimately have those charges withdrawn or be found not guilty.

As much as police would like the power to punish, it is a power that, for very good reason, is the sole province of the courts and should continue to be. This is another example of overreach and must be resisted by this parliament. This is not just my view; it is the view of the experts. Tasmania Legal Aid have said this clause and related clauses amount to eroding the presumption of innocence.

Currently, the clamping would only occur for one month - although imagine how you would cope going without your car for a month. Through this bill they are seeking the power for a first offence, for something as minor as giving someone the middle finger when you drive past them, to clamp a vehicle for three months. This could have a devastating impact on person's livelihood and life, and should be reserved only for the courts.

If it is a second offence, noting the first may have been simply negligent driving or gesticulating at another driver, this can result, if these amendments pass, to six months' clamping. If it is a third offence, it can be clamped until the resolution of the charges in court, which can take over a year.

To clamp a person's car for up to more than 12 months without a finding of guilt when one in five people are appearing before the Magistrates Court are found not guilty erodes the presumption of justice and should be resisted by the parliament.

I should add that the amendment sought through this clause is replicated in relation to clause 15, 16, and clause 21. Thank you, Chair.

Mr ELLIS - Thank you, Mr Garland. We worked through a few matters there. The period of disqualification mentioned that is in the existing act is almost a decade old. It is not reflective of the seriousness of this offending.

We have spoken already in this debate about people whose lives have been changed irrevocably by this kind of behaviour. We need to send a strong message that it is not just people being silly and having fun. The decision to act recklessly with these vehicles on the road, effectively operating a deadly weapon, needs to have a strong penalty so that we can ensure that we can protect the community.

As an example of some of the outdated matters, special penalties for clamping or confiscation was initially $600. Recent amendments to the Police Offences Regulations 2024 align this penalty with penalty units.

I note that prior to conviction an inspector of police can return a car where there is hardship. We have spoken about that discretion that police have as well as the courts. Seizure is not designed to punish someone who is innocent but otherwise impacted.

You spoke about a lower standard of proof: that police already have the power to seize a vehicle. They should have the power to seize a vehicle. That is good common sense. I hope that the parliament would support that. Parliament has already considered clamping appropriate prior to conviction.

The question before us today is, of course, whether the police should be able to act on evidence such as CCTV, dashcam footage, and other corroborating evidence where the offending behaviour is clearly demonstrated. That is what we are intending through Clause 14.

Clause 14 agreed to.

Clauses 15 to 20 agreed to.

Clause 21 -
Section 37Y amended (Forfeiture of vehicles)

Mr GARLAND - The effect of Clause 21 is to take away the sentencing discretion of the court. Taking the discretion away from a court is highly problematic because it removes the court's ability to tailor the sentence to meet the specific case before them. When justice is stripped of discretion, it becomes blind not only to prejudice but also to mercy, nuance and circumstance. It will remove the court's ability to prevent injustice by using their discretion not to order forfeiture of a vehicle when the circumstances do not warrant it.

I want to give an example to highlight how improper and unjust this amendment is. A 17-year old driver checks his mobile phone when they receive a message while driving. This momentary lapse of attention causes them to crash into the rear of the driver in front of them. The driver is charged with negligent driving to Section 32 (2) of the Traffic Act. The maximum penalty of this offence is five penalty units, or about $700. Noting the driver's age and circumstances, the magistrate fines them $150.

A few years later, the same driver decides to protest against climate change - like for example, Senator Pocock did a few years ago - by locking onto a vehicle as an act of civil disobedience. They are convicted and receive a substantial fine for their offending. A few years later, the same driver who now runs their own plumbing business is driving around in a $60,000 Toyota Hilux. A tourist driving a hire car changes lane in front of them without indicating. The driver is forced to slam on their brakes to avoid a collision and spills coffee all over their lap. Angered by this, the driver accelerates past the tourist and gives them the middle finger and yells at them to get off the road. The tourist is left upset and makes a complaint to police. The defendant is charged with the offence of road rage, which is a prescribed offence. The driver's car is clamped until the proceedings are finished. The sentencing magistrate has no choice but to order the forfeiture of the $60,000 ute. The driver's business folds and he is no longer able to support his family.

This may seem like an extreme example, but this is the whole point of leaving discretion with the magistrate or judge so they can fashion a sentence that is just in all circumstances of the case. The law cannot possibly foresee every example to come before the court. It cannot see around every corner. That is why judicial discretion is a fundamental tenet of the justice system and why it must be retained and this clause opposed. This example is also meant to demonstrate the absurdity of the road rage offence as currently drafted.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=9.5_D=8.6_C=0.87] The Labor Party have typically been opposed to mandatory sentencing, which is exactly what this is. It is not necessary and should be opposed.

Mr ELLIS -  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=26.2_D=25.6_C=0.84] The bill makes a forfeiture order mandatory upon conviction, but it does not remove the judicial discretion where the court is considering an application on the basis of hardship - which is effectively what you spoke about there, Mr Garland - and can quash the forfeiture order. It is also worth mentioning that this is for the third  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=52.6_D=5.4_C=0.69] or subsequent offence, so there is clearly a pattern of behaviour and [Bookmark: Phr5_O=59.0_D=22.9_C=0.88]  disregard for the severity of these matters. 

We have spoken already about the concerns that you have about minor matters in relation to road rage. We have cleared that up for the House so I will not go into it again, but I will reiterate that with forfeiture orders [Bookmark: Phr6_O=83.9_D=11.2_C=0.76] , it is for the third and subsequent offence. It is no different to the special penalty of $600 for clamped or confiscated vehicles [Bookmark: Phr7_O=95.4_D=26.8_C=0.76] . There are several reasons for an order - that an order must be made to facilitate this disposal of the vehicle: it is for vehicles at the lower end of value or valueless vehicles, and the offender rarely seeks to collect or retain possession. 

Often the owner or operator is unable to be ascertained. I spoke before about the feedback that we have had from Tasmania Police's road policing service that where a vehicle is of value, for example, the hoon took their grandma's car [Bookmark: Phr8_O=123.1_D=5.0_C=0.64] , there will be an interest in recouping the vehicle, and in these circumstances there is often representation. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=128.4_D=30.0_C=0.86]  During the court proceeding, there is discretion. 

Also, they are advised of a legislative framework at the time of clamping or confiscation. Where a motor vehicle is clamped or confiscated, paperwork is required to be served on the offender or registered operator, as the case may be. As I mentioned, this is for the third offence. There is discretion for the courts and there is good reason that we would use this to [Bookmark: Phr10_O=158.5_D=10.2_C=0.69]  keep the community safe, noting that we have addressed your concern about some minor matters pretty substantially and consistently as part of this debate.

DISABILITY RIGHTS, INCLUSION AND SAFEGUARDING(TRANSITIONAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 2025 (No. 8)

Second Reading
 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=173.8_D=7.2_C=0.27] 
 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=243.3_D=12.2_C=0.61] [4.05 p.m.]
Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) -  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=256.9_D=8.8_C=0.61]  [Bookmark: Phr23_O=280.2_D=9.4_C=0.82] Deputy Speaker, I move -

That the bill be now read the second time.

 [Bookmark: Phr24_O=290.9_D=14.1_C=0.86] The purpose of this bill is to amend certain acts and legislation to put in place additional and consequential arrangements in relation to the Disability Rights Inclusion Safeguarding Act 2024. As with the principal act, this bill has taken the path less travelled when it comes to our typical legislative process - first introduced in the other place, before coming down to this House.

I acknowledge the Minister for Disability Services, the honourable Jo Palmer, and her commitment to the principal act and her work on this necessary transitional bill.

This bill went through unanimously in the other place, wholeheartedly supported by all sides and, importantly, without any concerns from the disability community. During Ms Palmer's second reading speech on this bill in the other place, the minister reflected on how proud she was of the constructive collaboration of her colleagues in working together on the principal act to pass the most significant piece of legislation our community has seen in over a decade.

I share the minister's sentiments, as this also reflects my experience in taking the principal act through the lower House last year. The contributions made by members were deeply heartfelt, and we all shed some tears as we came together to ensure a safer, more inclusive Tasmania for those living with disability. I thank each and every one of you for your support. It was incredibly meaningful to our disability community and to the community at large to see their elected representatives genuinely working together to deliver better outcomes for those living with disability and their loved ones.

This bill is the next important step and will commence on the same day as the Disability Rights, Inclusion and Safeguarding Act 2024. The bill makes provision for transition from the Disability Services Act 2011, which will be repealed upon the commencement of the Disability Rights Inclusion and Safeguarding Act 2024. This includes transitional provisions in relation to transition of approvals, determinations, delegations or directions made by the former senior practitioner to the new senior practitioner.

In plain terms, these provisions ensure that approvals, determinations, delegations or other decisions made by the former senior practitioner and that were in effect immediately before the commencement of the new act are taken to be a decision made by the new senior practitioner as established by the new act. Arrangements for annual reporting by the former senior practitioner - this provision will ensure coverage in annual reporting for the entire year of transition and will cover reporting requirements both prior to and after the commencement of the new act. The preservation of approvals for restrictive practices - this will ensure approvals continue to be in force after the commencement of the new act on the same terms and conditions.

The treatment of applications for approval of restrictive practices which are in progress on the day of the commencement of the new act - under this provision, application to the secretary under the former act in progress on and after the commencement of the new act are to be treated as an application made to the new senior practitioner. Any application with TASCAT(Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal) that has not progressed to a hearing is taken on the commencement day to be an application made to the new senior practitioner. If the application has progressed to a hearing before the commencement day, it may remain with TASCAT, and any approval after the commencement day will be taken as an authorisation by the senior practitioner. The treatment of any reviews by the secretary, tribunal and Magistrates Court which are in progress on the day of the commencement of the new act and the treatment of information provided under the former act - part 3 to part 11 of the bill provide for consequential amendments to other legislation. In most instances, this is a change from the Disability Services Act 2011 to the Disability Rights Inclusion and Safeguarding Act 2024.

Changes are also made where the interpretation of certain terms has been updated in the new legislation, for example, the term 'disability service provider.' Changes are made to the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2020, which previously referred to restrictive intervention within the meaning of the Disability Services Act 2011 and is changed to the updated definition of restrictive practice included in the new act.

Part 11 outlines changes to the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2020, which reflects the change in pathway for approval of restrictive practices to the new senior practitioner established in the Disability Rights Inclusion and Safeguarding Act 2024. These changes also reflect the creation of the external review function within TASCAT.

Honourable Speaker, I commend the bill to the House.

[4.11 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I am pleased to be able to provide some brief comments on behalf of the opposition and indicate that we will be supporting the transitional and consequential amendment bill, as we supported the original bill as well.

We recognise that while it is the Premier bringing the bill through the lower House here, it is the Minister for Disability in the other place, Ms Palmer, who has overseen this very large body of work. Correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that this body of work began back when Mr Rockliff held the disability portfolio a little while ago, before he was Premier. I recognise that the original bill that we dealt with last year and this transitional and consequential amendment bill comes off the back of many years of work in the department and the sector. On that note, I recognise the departmental officers in the minister's department and the Premier's department who have been working on this for some time. Many of them are here in the Chamber today and have given briefings to the opposition and other MPs as we have worked through these bills.

The bill that was taken through last year really was a significant body of work. It was also a significant philosophical change in terms of being, I believe, the first in the country that has taken a very clear rights-based approach to the matters dealt with in that piece of legislation. It was broadly consulted and, indeed, as we saw last year, the minister was amenable to amendments right up until the debate on the bill, which I think strengthened the legislation and reflected the very strongly held views of advocates in the disability community.

Importantly, that bill and this one today also provide a really strong foundation for future reforms to further strengthen the rights of people with disability across all areas of government. I look forward to that work continuing.

As was noted in the upper House and in the Premier's second reading contribution, this is a fairly straightforward bill. It is a necessary bill to follow the substantive bill the Parliament dealt with last year. It makes, as it is named, transitional and consequential amendments to a range of pieces of legislation to accommodate the changes that the parliament agreed to last year. It amends the Child and Youth Safe Organisations Act 2023, the Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act 1997, the Dangerous Criminals and High Risk Offenders Act 2021, the End-of-Life Choices (Voluntary Assisted Dying) Act 2021, the Obstetric and Paediatric Mortality and Morbidity Act 1994, the Poisons Regulations 2018, the Registration to Work with Vulnerable People Regulations 2024, and the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2024, and that is amended in a number of sections.
It makes administrative changes referring to new terms and allowing the new act to take its course. I am losing words today, I am distracted. It makes a number of administrative changes that are required to allow that new regime to operate, including differentiating between the senior practitioner as that role was described in the formal legislation, and the new senior practitioner role that was created in the piece of legislation we approved last year. It deals with transition of approvals, determinations, delegations or directions made by that former senior practitioner and the new role. It deals with the preservation of approvals for restrictive practices so that they continue to be in force after the commencement of the new act on the same terms and conditions. I note that the new act does make a number of changes to the use of restrictive practices. It makes arrangements for reporting by the former senior practitioner and transitioning annual reporting requirements from the old act, the Disability Services Act 2011, to the new one. It also incorporates pathways of review to TASCAT and related purposes.

I am pleased to be able to provide that very short contribution. As supported all of the amendments in this bill in the upper House, we will support them in this Chamber too.

[4.16 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL - Honourable Speaker, I want to begin by echoing the words of other people who have spoken in here this afternoon. I know also, in the other place, much has been spoken about the importance of the Disability Rights, Inclusion and Safeguarding Bill and what a significant piece of legislation it was. It is not that long ago since we passed it and I think that we are all still pleased with that, and still appreciating the value and the importance of that bill.

As we debate this bill today - and the Greens will definitely be supporting this bill - I acknowledge and recognise the importance of the principal bill that we passed last year. When we finished debating that bill last year, there was some conversation about it being the beginning of changes that would come and it would make a difference for people who live with disability. I think the bill that we are debating today is part of that, ensuring that the principal Disability Rights, Inclusion and Safeguarding Bill does the work that it is meant to, and is able to do that smoothly and transition into it.

I recognise the things that this bill will do in ensuring that decisions made under the old act are validated as if they were made under the new provisions. When they commence, this bill will provide for the annual report under the new act to be able to cover the period for which the old act was in force in the year in which the acts transition.

This bill ensures that restrictive practice, approvals, application and reviews that are enforced or in progress on the transition day remain in force or in progress under the new provisions, and information held under the provisions of the old act are held under the provisions of the new act. It also amends other legislation and ensures that references to the old act are replaced with references to the new act. On the surface, these might seem like small changes, but I think they are all part of that big change that we are working towards.

It is our pleasure to support this and to help ensure that the transition in our state goes smoothly and well and without interruption.

[4.18 p.m.]
Mr STREET (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I am proud to stand in support of the Disability Rights, Inclusion and Safeguarding (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2025. I want to start by echoing the thoughts that have already been expressed by members opposite. I often stand in this place and for all of what the community sees on television each night about parliament, the arguing, the behaviour and what they see in clips from Question Time, there are plenty of times when this House comes together to provide unanimous support for bills, to make Tasmanians lives better. This is certainly one such occasion, as was the passing of the main bill last year.

I acknowledge that this bill that we are talking about today passed the other place unanimously as well. Without wanting to reflect on a vote of the other place, I thank them for their support of what the government is doing as well. I do say 'the government' because this has been a passion project for the Minister for Disability Services, Ms Palmer, and also for the Premier when he was Disability Services minister. It is work that the whole parliament can take credit for as well, in terms of the transition from the old 2011 act to the current 2024 act, and now this consequential amendment bill as well. It is something we should all be proud of.

As I said, some of you in here today may remember the rather unusual sight of the Minister for Disability Services sitting in the adviser's box last year while the Premier took the bill through. This was a demonstration of how important it was to her to see the passage of this bill, and how passionate she is about it. Again, I acknowledge her presence here in the Speaker's Reserve today to see this consequential amendment bill go through this House. I do not want to pre-empt the vote, but everyone so far has expressed their support for it, so I think I can safely say that this consequential amendment bill is going to pass with the unanimous support of both Houses of Parliament.

I acknowledge the significance of the principal act last year to our Premier who once held the portfolio of minister for Disability Services. As we know, the principal act implements several new reforms, including establishing the formal inclusion of people with disability and leadership through the creation of a Disability Inclusion Advisory Council. It also:

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=5.0_D=9.1_C=0.79] Promotes a social model of disability and the human rights expressed within the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability and Australia's Disability Strategy.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=14.8_D=14.5_C=0.74] Formalises requirements relating to consultation, planning and reporting and progress in delivering actions through a legislated Tasmanian Disability Inclusion Plan and action plans for defined entities such as government departments and GBEs.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=29.7_D=7.8_C=0.75] Elevates the role of the Office of the Senior Practitioner to that of decision maker for the authorisation of restrictive practices used by disability service providers.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=38.1_D=16.4_C=0.81] Makes provision for a community visitor scheme to be established in the future, which is a recommendation from the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People With Disability. 

Importantly, many measures in the act align with recommendations handed down by that royal commission.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=55.9_D=25.2_C=0.82] The principal act also establishes the commissioner as a person who is independent of government and lists the functions and powers of the role, including:

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=127.3_D=4.6_C=0.86] I have also been advised that there will be an announcement very soon about the appointment of the disability commissioner.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=133.5_D=25.2_C=0.84] The legislation in front of us today provides a number of consequential provisions from the previous Disability Services Act 2011 to the Disability Rights, Inclusion and Safeguarding Act 2024. This includes amendments to eight pieces of state legislation to reflect the title of the new act and updating the meaning of 'disability services provider' in line with the new act, specifically under the Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act 1997 and Poisons Regulations 2018.  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=159.6_D=11.0_C=0.74] Additionally, the consequential provisions include updating the meaning of disability in the End-of-Life Choices (Voluntary Assisted Dying) Act of 2021 and Registration to Work with Vulnerable People Regulations 2014.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=172.1_D=17.1_C=0.73] Finally, as reflected by the Premier in his second reading speech, changes are made to the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act of 2020, which previously referred to 'restrictive intervention' within the meaning of the Disability Services Act 2011, and is changed to the updated definition of restrictive practice included in the new act.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=190.2_D=13.0_C=0.72] Part 11 outlines changes to the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2020 which reflect the change in pathway for approval of restrictive practices to the new Senior Practitioner established in the Disability Rights, Inclusion and Safeguarding Act. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=204.1_D=4.2_C=0.64]  These changes also reflect the creation of the external review function within TASCAT.
 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=210.0_D=10.1_C=0.78] The principal act is a strong reflection of our government's commitment to supporting people with disability, the people who support and advocate for them and the wider community to deliver better outcomes for people with disability.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=221.3_D=25.1_C=0.81] Again, I acknowledge the work of the Minister for Disability Services, who has worked on the development of the principal act over a few years, and the Premier who I know is dedicated to creating a Tasmania that is truly inclusive. 

I also acknowledge every member of our community who shared their stories and experiences with us and gave considered and critical feedback to ensure that the measures implemented under the principal act will truly deliver for our Tasmanian disability community. I cannot emphasise enough [Bookmark: Phr19_O=247.3_D=29.0_C=0.78]  that when we are making laws in this place, the feedback we receive from the people most affected by them is incredibly important in making sure we get things right. 

After the 2021 review of the Disability Services Act, it became clear that new comprehensive legislation was necessary, one that would align our state with contemporary understandings of the rights of people with disability. The principal act was developed to reflect changes coming through Australia's Disability Strategy, the current NDIS (National Disability Insurance Scheme) review and, of course, the  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=277.2_D=5.0_C=0.76] disability royal commission recommendations. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=283.6_D=8.8_C=0.82]  As a government, we listened carefully to the voices of stakeholders throughout a two-year consultation period, ensuring key aspects of the bill are reflective of views of the disability community. 

 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=293.2_D=11.7_C=0.80] Significantly, the principal act's human rights focus has been strengthened to advance and safeguard the rights of all people with disabilities, as well as advance the full and effective inclusion of all people with disabilities. The consulting does not end here; the principal act itself includes a great deal about consultation with, and inclusion of people with disability, as well as clauses relating to who should be consulting with whom and when consultation should be undertaken. The development of disability inclusion action plans by defined entities is a clear example.

Under this clause, there is a requirement that defined entities undertake consultation with people with disability and design consultation so that people with disability have an equal opportunity to contribute. 

Additionally, the principal act sets out the mechanism to establish the Disability Inclusion Advisory Council. The council will comprise a majority of people with disability and will, amongst other roles, provide independent advice to both the Minister for Disability Services and the Disability Commissioner. I understand work is underway to release expressions of interest for this council soon.

The principal act also reflects the needs and wants of Tasmanians living with disability and provides the mechanisms, particularly through the review process, to ensure the provisions in the bill remain fit for purpose for the years ahead.

I will share the words of Disability Voices Tasmania released just prior to the principal act passing parliament last year:

We will then have a piece of legislation that we can proudly say will be the best and most rights-focused piece of disability-related legislation in Australia… The Tasmanian disability community will be celebrating a piece of legislation that promotes and protects the human rights of Tasmanians with disability, legislation which is unique in Australia.

That is something the government can be proud of, but it is also something this parliament can be proud of and Tasmanians can be proud of. As a former minister for Community Services, many of the stakeholders I dealt with cross over both the Community Services and Disability Services portfolios. I know how important this work has been to many stakeholders and representative organisations across the state. It is why I wanted to take the opportunity to speak briefly today. In many respects, the important legislation was passed last year, but it is also important that we pass this consequential amendment bill so that every other piece of legislation reflects the principal act. 

I am proud of our government for leading the nation on this issue but, in the spirit of tripartisanship, the parliament of Tasmania should be very proud that we now have nation-leading legislation. I commend the bill to the House.

[4.29 p.m.]
Mrs BESWICK (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to support the Disability Rights, Inclusion and Safeguarding (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2025. This is a vital piece of legislation that ensures the promises we made in the principal bill are fully realised in practice. I must admit, wandering around different places, I find myself contemplating what we achieved in that bill and how the enactment of the inclusion plans will actually flow out into the community. I have noticed things like a little sign at a traditional bus stop saying when the buses are coming. I now realise what it is like to be blind, having watched my husband for the last couple of years. How the hell is anyone supposed to read those things? The print is, like, 0.5.

A member - If they are on there. Sometimes, they are not even on there.

Mrs BESWICK - You do not really get them in Devonport, I have just noticed them around Hobart. It is something that is so practical that I would hope it would be picked up in those plans - that someone would say, 'Actually, that is not a very useful thing for the majority of the people who use our buses to see.' It is some of those really useful things. I have discovered a general hatred of stairs. I know we have had them for millennia, that they were always a practical thing, but they are not practical for people who do not move easily. Out of the box come all these sorts of concepts of what we can achieve with this bill. What can we achieve in the next few years in terms of how Tasmania might look and feel with the inclusion of disability plans and in the way we interact with people who do not have every faculty. 

I do not know the best way to say that, but if you have a disability, a mobility issue, a vision issue, or whatever it might be, there are many things in our society that make things hard. It is so much harder for them. I am excited to see what this bill will do. This bill is  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=9.3_C=0.72] going to fix up some of those administrative things, make it all functional, make sure we are moving in the right direction and that legislation does not  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=40.7_D=19.1_C=0.77] go against itself. I am looking forward to seeing what will be achieved in this next few years through the disability rights, inclusion and safeguarding legislation we have put in place and I am excited to be here listening and watching it happen.
[4.32 p.m.]
Mr FAIRS (Bass) -  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=61.5_D=3.0_C=0.47] Honourable Speaker, I congratulate the Minister for Disability Services, Jo Palmer, on her amazing work. I have known Jo for many years and there may not be much of her, but her heart is 10 times the size of her tiny frame. Incredible The passion I have seen in this area with the minister [Bookmark: Phr7_O=102.2_D=2.7_C=0.54]  is incredible and well before she was even in politics. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=106.2_D=25.3_C=0.80]  Her work is incredible. I also congratulate the Premier for his passion and commitment to Tasmanians with disabilities. 

It is incredible that we have had two great people and passionate people driving this for people with disabilities, and to everyone in this Chamber too, from everyone I have heard [Bookmark: Phr9_O=133.2_D=3.2_C=0.46]  - as Nic Street said before [Bookmark: Phr10_O=137.7_D=29.2_C=0.79] , no one looks like they are going to oppose it, which is fantastic, very rare, but it is wonderful to see that we are united, it seems, in this, which is great. 

I do stand here proudly. It is a privilege to support the Disability Rights, Inclusion and Safeguarding (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Bill 2025. This is the final step towards enacting the principal act, one that which will certainly drive [Bookmark: Phr11_O=167.1_D=29.7_C=0.80]  better outcomes for Tasmanians living with disability.

As a mechanical bill, so to speak, the measures in this legislation allow for the amendments to state legislation to reflect the title of the new act and update the meaning of 'disability service provider' in line with the new act. Additionally, as reflected in the Premier's speech under this bill, changes are made to the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2020, which previously referred to [Bookmark: Phr12_O=197.3_D=28.5_C=0.79]  restrictive intervention within the meaning of the Disability Services Act 2011 and is changed to the updated definition of restrictive practice included in the new act. 

Part 11 outlines changes to the Tasmanian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2020 which reflect the change in pathway for approval of restrictive practices to the new Senior Practitioner established in the Disability Rights Inclusion and Safeguarding Act 2024. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=226.7_D=5.3_C=0.78]  These changes also reflect the creation of the external review function within TASCAT.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=233.4_D=27.1_C=0.82] Through passage of this bill, we can begin implementing the most significant disability act in almost 14 years for our Tasmanian disability community, one where the principal act was developed with the voices of Tasmanians with disability. I note the bill was supported unanimously in the other place, with members from all sides again acknowledging the importance of the principal act. That is commendable.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=260.8_D=2.1_C=0.88] 'Nothing about us [Bookmark: Phr16_O=263.2_D=11.8_C=0.77]  without us' is a phrase that dates back centuries, along with the call for governments to ensure that policies and programs are designed with input of the very people who will be impacted. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=275.8_D=19.1_C=0.77]  This motto has been at the centre in the development of the principal act, after our government committed in 2021 to begin drafting new, contemporary legislation to advance and safeguard the human rights of people with disability, and ensure their full and effective inclusion in the Tasmanian community.
 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=295.9_D=9.1_C=0.92] 
Participation in the consultation period for the exposure draft was significant, with a broad range of stakeholders providing feedback; face-to-face sessions, with involvement from the Interim Disability Commissioner, Mary Mallett, were held across the state, and more people participated in targeted consultation sessions. I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of Mary Mallett as Interim Disability Commissioner, who wraps up her last day in the role on Thursday.
Our government listened carefully to the feedback provided throughout this process and made some key changes to reflect the views of the disability community, delivering nation-leading reform. I think we should all be very proud of that.

In addition to drafting this necessary bill in front of us today, in the months following the passing of the principal act, significant work has been undertaken to get ready for the commencement, including recruiting to key positions and creating the policies, procedures, guidelines and necessary systems that need to be in place before commencement. As you can see, we are very keen to get this going and get it right for our disability community.

As I wrap up speaking on this matter today, I would like to share the words of one of Tasmania's strongest disability advocates, Jane Wardlaw, reflecting on what the principal act means for Tasmanians living with disability. Jane said:

Too many of us who live with disability know too many of our peers who have died at the hands of poor service delivery, conscious and unconscious negative attitudes about disability, lack of inclusion and connectedness within the community, their human rights ignored. In contrast, this bill honours their experiences and puts into legislation a framework built around the human rights of disabled people that are recognised and respected. We can change the culture from exclusion, oppression and marginalisation to equality, dignity and respect.

This legislation promises to have a lasting impacts that will benefit disabled people, their families and significant others. It will ensure that disabled people are included in the design and development of legislation and policy at government level, remain safe and secure, and have the opportunity to live full and flourishing lives.

Let us reflect on that last line from Ms Wardlaw as she describes the opportunity for Tasmanians living with disability to be safe, secure and to live a full life. This bill is the final step to delivering what our Tasmanian disability community deserve, and not a moment too soon.

Honourable Speaker, I commend this bill to the House.

The SPEAKER - Before I call the Premier, I commend members for their contributions, and remind the members who have spoken that 60 per cent of legislation goes through parliament in Australia unamended, which is a positive thing that never makes the media.

[4.39 p.m.]
Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) - Honourable Speaker, I thank Ms Haddad, Ms Rosol, Mr Street, Mrs Beswick, and Mr Fairs for their contributions. Thank you for bringing your views not only to the substantive bill previously debated, but also reflecting in the contributions today, either through lived experience or knowing friends and loved ones with lived experience. Thank you, Mr Fairs, for reflecting the views of Jane Wardlaw as well.

Thank you, everyone, for the support of the consequential amendments that we are putting forward, and also for the substantive bill which has gone through both Houses of parliament unanimously, which is a significant testament to the hard work of many people.
First, I pay tribute to the voices of lived experience who have been so crucial in the advocacy for change and for this legislation, including the establishment of a Disability Commissioner, and this important piece of legislation that carries Tasmania nation-leading. Most importantly, the voices of lived experience really made the debate, discussion and the consultation so very real, for not only the Minister for Disability Services, but for members of parliament and our departmental staff as well.

I pay tribute to our departmental staff team for their work, including those who worked 
very hard in Ms Palmer's office as well. It is not only members of parliament who can make a difference. We are all here to make a difference and improve the lives of all Tasmanians, and I see such passion when I meet people within the department. This is a great example of the people who have contributed to this - their passion, their compassion and their commitment to making people's lives better and making a positive difference to the outcomes for Tasmanians, in this case people with disability and their family and loved ones. It is a great testament to the people working in and across our public service, and I thank you all for that.

Thank you, Ms Palmer, for your leadership when it comes to this legislation. It is very much appreciated by many and all stakeholders, and particularly people with lived experience with disability.

As mentioned by Mr Fairs, I pay tribute to Mary Mallett, the interim disability commissioner. Mary has done an extraordinary job, starting back in January 2023. Mary has worked tirelessly and closely with people with disability across Tasmania to ensure that their voices and their views shaped how we set up the Office of Disability Commissioner; indeed they are the very reason why we are here today. Thank you, Mary, for the wonderful contribution that you have made in that important role.

I conclude my comments there, but thank all members for their contributions and the support of such a significant reform that will make Tasmania a better place. Thank you.

That the House does now adjourn.

Answer to Question - Cybersecurity - Potential Breaches Due to Redundancies
Answer to Question - Macquarie Point Stadium - Private Partnership

[4.44 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, in answer to Ms Dow, minister Palmer advises there has been an internal restructure of executive positions within DECYP, including establishment of the role of Deputy Secretary, People and Culture to deliver on the recommendations of the commission of inquiry. At the end of June, the associate secretary will revert to the deputy secretary position, meaning no net increase in full-time equivalent positions at the executive board level.

In answer to Mr Willie, the Treasurer advises that the Department of Treasury has two staff dedicated to cybersecurity. The Treasury information technology branch also works in close collaboration with the whole-of-government cybersecurity team around new risks, training and improving the cyber capabilities of government.

There is a central Tasmanian government cybersecurity team within Department of Premier and Cabinet (DPAC) comprising five people. Across government agencies there are an additional 27 staff operating in cybersecurity roles, including the two dedicated Treasury roles. The government cyber capabilities are also supported by various external partnerships and relationships both centrally and in the agencies.

In answer to Mr Bayley, the Premier advises that MinterEllison was appointed by the Office of the Crown Solicitor to advise the Macquarie Point Development Corporation of the Crown on 5 July 2024. They were appointed following a competitive process involving all law firms on the Office of the Crown Solicitors panel of external law firms. The scope of the appointment was to advise on legal matters related to the stadium project, including assisting with all aspects of the Project of State Significance process. MinterEllison are engaged to provide legal services until the conclusion of the project.


Planning

[4.46 pm]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I will talk this evening about planning matters. We heard during Question Time this morning that not long after the Tasmanian Planning Commission's draft assessment report of the Macquarie Point Stadium was released, seeds of doubt were planted by the Macquarie Point Development Corporation. Through their interstate lawyers, they launched an extraordinary attack on an independent body set up by the Tasmanian Planning Commission which features, among other experts, a former deputy solicitor-general and Treasury secretary. It was almost entirely predictable. We saw one type of process bypassed for another process so that it fits the bill, and this is not the way to do planning.

Planning is a really fundamental part of our system. We know the government has been hell bent on taking planning away from local government in decision-making with that statutory planning process, and we see it eroded time and again. Quite often it is councils which are doing a lot of the heavy lifting for strategic planning that is often not undertaken to its fullest or best extent by an ailing government that falls short.

There is a pattern emerging wherein if a developer or the government do not get their desired outcome from existing planning processes, a path around the process is created. This is what we have seen with the Macquarie Point Stadium proposal. If you cannot build a shopping centre because it does not align with the planning scheme - and this is another example that we had to consider in this place at the end of last year - you might work with the local planning authority to address these concerns, or you might lobby the government to update the planning scheme and change the laws. You might want to get a decent, updated and relevant, contemporary Regional Land Use Strategy in place.

It is much cheaper and much faster to take out a full-page ad in the paper spelling out your demands, because just a day or so later the parliament will swing into action behind you with special legislation approving your development, literally and figuratively bulldozing your way through. This is what has happened with the Stony Rise shopping centre proposed by developer Tipalea, whose proponents did not even try to hide the fact that they had donated to the major parties, presumably motivated by a sincere passion for democracy - I say that tongue in cheek.

We now have the spectacle of the Premier laying the groundwork for an escalation of these tactics at Macquarie Point. Enabling legislation is quite on the cards. The Greens are very concerned about this, as are many members of the community. Not only are the Greens concerned, the president of the Tasmanian branch of the Planning Institute of Australia said in a media release dated 4 April:

This is the second project within four months where parliament is setting aside a legislated approval process for a political decision. This reinforces our previous concerns about the ongoing lack of investment by the state in Tasmania's planning system. Parliament may not like the current Projects of State Significance process, but good planning outcomes require a strong social licence -

A strong social licence - I would like to emphasise that -

- in the decisions that are made, which requires trust in the approval process and assessment criteria. Since parliament clearly has concerns over the functions of our planning system, they need to find solutions to fix those problems for everyone. The current legislative interventions for special projects risks a two-speed planning system: one for those with political contacts and another for those of us without.

Time expired.

The SPEAKER - I am sorry, time has expired. My apologies, I will take Dr Broad. Apologies for not paying attention there.



Government's Legislative Agenda

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=27.8_D=9.1_C=0.66] [4.51 p.m.]
Dr BROAD (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, here we are today, adjourning almost three hours early, and it is obvious to everybody here - apart from the government perhaps - that their so-called strong plan is in tatters. It is in tatters because they have no agenda.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=37.3_D=28.5_C=0.74] We have another bill on the blue today - the Land Use Planning and Approvals Amendment (Sensitive Disclosures) Bill. I am ready to go. We could be debating that. Instead, the government has pulled up stumps almost three hours early. Why is that? That is because there is virtually nothing left to debate. This is a government that has completely run out of an agenda. Not even the machinery of government type bills have been tabled. 

We see that the government, because of this complete lack of an agenda, is on the horns of a dilemma. The reason why they have to hold over the Land Use Planning and Approvals Amendment (Sensitive Disclosures) Bill is because, if they do it today - and we could get through this quite quickly - they will have nothing to do on Thursday. Why will they have nothing to do on Thursday? It is because they have not been tabling bills. We know now that bills take three days to mature, and there are other things that they are completely  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=96.5_D=29.8_C=0.77] avoiding, like bringing on the Tasmanian Community Fund amendment. 

Why are they not they bringing that on? There is business that we could doing right now and instead this House has adjourned. What is going to happen on Thursday? There is virtually nothing to debate even on Thursday. On top of that, because they only tabled one bill today, there is another dilemma. When we come back in the first week of May, again, there will be nothing for the government to debate. They are not  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=126.7_D=29.8_C=0.78] tabling bills and they have got absolutely no agenda, so much so that we are finishing three hours early today. More than likely we will be finishing early again on Thursday, and then we will probably have nothing to do when we come back in the first week of May. 

This is a government that has no plan. We are not talking about a strong plan. There is no plan. This is a government with nowhere to go. I find it absolutely incredible and this has been coming for some time. What is going on with this government?

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=156.8_D=29.0_C=0.80] It seems like the wheels of government have completely ground to a halt. I know that there are bills that should be tabled, that should be in development, that we should have already seen, and we have not. We know that the government has made promises to stakeholders about bringing on legislation and we have not seen it. Why is that? Is it because the Cabinet is completely dysfunctional? We know that this government is completely dysfunctional. It seems like their Cabinet processes perhaps have ground things to a halt, so there is no agenda for them.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=186.7_D=29.8_C=0.62] We know for example, in my portfolio of resources, there are two bills that need amending: there is Sibanye, the proponents of Copper Mines Of Tasmania - getting that restarted. There have been discussions with government about bringing on a bill to amend a couple of acts there to give them comfort to restart the mine. Have not seen it. It should have happened a year ago. Have not seen it. What is this government doing? What is their agenda? We cannot see it from legislation because there is nothing left.

We ticked off police offences; we ticked off disability rights; the only thing left is community protection, land use planning approvals and the Tasmanian Community Fund. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=216.9_D=12.6_C=0.69]  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=230.5_D=30.0_C=0.78]  That is all there is. That is it; that is the whole agenda. I do not think there has ever been a list of bills this thin. We know that there has been virtually no productivity from this government when it comes to legislation. We know in the last term that they passed hardly any bills, a record-low number of bills passed in the last year before the last election. We know that after that last year there was even less. 

Now we see - here we are  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=261.5_D=18.2_C=0.77] - this government is a year in and they are literally going to run out of bills this week. They are going to literally clear the entire blue. What happened? What is going on here? This is just so embarrassing for the government and this has been coming for a long time. It is not as if you cannot predict it [Bookmark: Phr12_O=281.5_D=9.2_C=0.73] , because a bill takes three days to mature. A bill had to be tabled Tuesday last week, the last sitting week, to be debated today.  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=291.4_D=13.4_C=0.79] They only tabled one bill today. Therefore, there will only be one bill to debate next sitting. What is going on with this government? It is an absolute disgrace. This whole strong plan is complete nonsense. The government is stumbling around in the dark and they cannot even come up with stuff to do in the parliament. It is obscene. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=13.0_D=21.7_C=0.61]  The next thing you know they will want to maybe skip a week of parliament because there is literally nothing to do. We want our question time. We want our private members' time. The government has no bills to debate. How embarrassing. This has to be a first.


Inside Pompeii: Origins of a European Way of Life - TMAG Exhibition

[4.56 p.m.]
Ms OGILVIE (Clark - Minister for the Arts and Heritage)  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=36.9_D=16.0_C=0.50] - Ciao amici, honourable Speaker, I rise this evening to highlight a remarkable exhibit that is currently on display [Bookmark: Phr4_O=53.4_D=29.8_C=0.78]  at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, our much-loved TMAG. It was with great excitement on Friday evening that I welcomed to Australia the photographic exhibition Inside Pompeii: Origins of a European Way of Life. This event also marked the fruition of an idea that began in my office in August of last year as I sat across from Gabriele Visentin, Ambassador to the European Union, and we began the journey to [Bookmark: Phr5_O=83.5_D=29.5_C=0.83]  work out how to showcase these compelling photographs in our great state of Tasmania. 

Tasmania is the first place in the country to host this visually stunning exhibition and collection. The exhibition is comprised of photographs of Pompeii, a World Heritage Site, taken by Italian photographer Luigi Spina during COVID-19 when the site was closed to tourists. These photos provide a rare opportunity to step inside the [Bookmark: Phr6_O=113.6_D=26.4_C=0.77]  homes of Pompeii and witness the city's timeless beauty. 

Pompeii stands as one of the most remarkable archaeological sites in the world. Once a thriving Roman city, it was literally frozen in time by the catastrophic eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 49AD. The layers of volcanic ash preserved an extraordinary glimpse into daily life nearly 2000 years ago [Bookmark: Phr7_O=140.8_D=3.4_C=0.67] , giving us a valuable insight into ancient art, architecture [Bookmark: Phr8_O=144.6_D=29.9_C=0.83]  and human resilience. 

This exhibition is more than just a showcase of breathtaking imagery. It is a powerful reminder of the importance of cultural heritage and preservation. Each photograph invites us to reflect on history, light and time, deepening our appreciation for the fragility and resilience of the past. Tasmania has long been a custodian of heritage, and just as the EU has invested in the conservation of Pompeii, we too [Bookmark: Phr9_O=174.7_D=29.7_C=0.83]  are committed to protecting and celebrating our cultural sites, ensuring future generations can learn from and connect with the past. 

Tasmania has five of Australia's World Heritage sites. Bringing Inside Pompeii to Tasmania is a testament to our international collaboration with the European Union and highlights the importance of collaboration. The Tasmanian government is proud to support world-class artistic and [Bookmark: Phr10_O=204.8_D=30.0_C=0.84]  cultural projects like this one. 

Arts and culture play a fundamental role in shaping our identity, fostering international connections and providing opportunities for Tasmanians to engage with global perspectives. Our investment in institutions like TMAG ensures that our community continues to experience world-class exhibitions that inspire, educate and spark important conversations. This exhibition is a perfect example of how art and history can transcend [Bookmark: Phr11_O=235.1_D=29.7_C=0.81]  time and borders to connect us all. 

Bringing Inside Pompeii: Origins of a European Way of Life to Tasmania reflects our commitment to world-class arts and culture and our international partnership with the European Union and I am delighted to see this project come to fruition. I am also delighted to report that the Italian contingent turned out in good force to see the exhibition on Friday evening and [Bookmark: Phr12_O=265.1_D=26.2_C=0.84]  there was such a warm and touching welcome both for the European Union delegates and the Italian community.

I encourage everybody to go and see the exhibition and take this remarkable journey through history and experience - the magic of Pompeii here in Australia, here in Tasmania. I will share a little anecdote that I gave on the evening when I was making my speech. I studied cultural heritage, archaeology and ancient civilisations, and the Jurassic period at Melbourne University back in the 1980s. I have always wanted to see Pompeii and to travel to see the frescoes and see that frozen-in-time place, and have never been able to do that. To have a part of Pompeii come to Tasmania is really touching and a really good thing to happen. I feel it very personally and I can only imagine how our wonderful Italian community feels for those who can see a little glimpse of Pompeii here for themselves - for their grandparents, for their children, that beautiful Italian community, to have something this spectacular, this remarkable come to our museum and art gallery is fantastic.

I will let the House know that the cultural diplomacy that we do is really important, particularly in the arts. I am reaching out to other countries and other places to do more of this. It has been well received, and I am looking forward to having a stream of interesting things come to Tasmania, and also to have us working with them in their place.

Matt Dingjan - Relay for Life

[5.02 p.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise this evening to celebrate an incredible individual. Every now and then in life you meet someone and they move you, they inspire you and they demonstrate what it means to get something done. A couple of weeks ago, Matt Dingjan from Launceston reached out and asked if I would assist in supporting and promoting a mission that he was on.

Matt was on a mission in honour of his late mum Deb to run for 24 hours for the Relay for Life with the mission of raising $100,000 for cancer research and cancer support. Over the last five months, Matt has been training for this mission. He has run something like 2500 kilometres over the last five months, which has taken him away from his family. However, his family has been behind him every step of the way because what he was seeking to do is build a community around him in order to support the great work of the Cancer Council in Tasmania by raising funds. Every now and then, someone says, 'I am going to aim for the stars and I am going to build a community of people around me and I am going to get it done.'

For an individual anywhere across the world, but especially for an individual in Launceston, to say, 'I am going to run for 24 hours and raise $100,000', is phenomenal. To actually achieve it and be able to put your body through that process with an incredibly warm and supportive group of people to get you through it is extraordinary. What we witnessed from Friday night at 9.00 p.m. in Launceston until 9.00 p.m. on Saturday evening was sheer determination. It was pure passion and love, it was community and it was mateship. It was extraordinary to see Matt himself at his most raw and often at a really low point, but be buoyed and bounce back with the support of his friends - friends who come from his family, from life, from sporting clubs, from all sorts of businesses around the local community who were there for him in that moment. 

There was not a time where Matt was on his own over the 24 hours. There was always someone with him, either running with him or cheering for him from the sides. At some point there were tens of people there running with him around the track, keeping him motivated and keeping him on task. At the end, when he actually brought it home at 9.00 p.m. on Saturday night, there were around 50 or 60 people there with him, willing him across those final moments. He ran over 160 kilometres over the period of the 24 hours.

To date he has raised nearly $68,000. Someone from the Cancer Council on the night explained to those people who were present what that actually meant in relation to providing individual hours of care, providing support and education for people in the community. There is no doubt that the work that Cancer Council Tasmania do is really important, and there are many people in our community who have been supported by them.

The organisers and the local committee for Relay for Life did an incredible job bringing that event back to St Leonards and having the community around the track there for that period of time. This year the Relay for Life was only 12 hours, but when Matt committed to it, it had been a 24-hour event, so he actually started 12 hours early, which is extraordinary. 

One of the things that I would like to do is shout out to Matt, his beautiful wife Cass, their kids, the family, the friends and everyone who backed him in. There were over 40 businesses that donated to and supported Matt in his quest to raise this money - lots of friends, lots of community organisations, lots of sporting organisations and people from this parliament as well. While we are in parliament, I want to shout out to the Transport department. I reached out to the Minister for Transport and someone from his office was right on task. We were able to get approvals fast-tracked for him to raise money on the side of the road on the northern outlet on one day in the lead-up to the event.

The purpose of rising tonight and making this contribution on Adjournment is to say: Matt, you are extraordinary. You have inspired our community. You have definitely done it for Deb. There is no doubt that Deb would be proud of you and that everyone is proud of you. I know that for all of the relayers who were at the Relay for Life on that night, donations can still come in and I would encourage anybody, whether it's $1, $10, or $100, whatever you are able to donate. If you are able to back someone who you know who was at the event, or Matt and his team, then that would be welcomed by all those families and individuals in Tasmania at the moment who are experiencing cancer. Congratulations, well done, thank you. You are incredible and the community is very grateful for what you did.


Children and Young People in Watchhouses

[5.07 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to speak about a matter of the utmost seriousness: the practice of sending children and young people to adult watch-houses. At the outset, I acknowledge your advice that members in this place have a responsibility to reflect on evidence given in the committee hearings in an appropriate way. I can assure you and those listening that everything I mention in my speech was put on the public record in an open session of the Joint Standing Committee examining the government's commission of inquiry response. There is no reference to any in camera evidence, any deliberative meetings, or any other matters before the committee.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, member. Next time just say, 'I will be abiding by the Standing Orders' and we will be fine.

Ms ROSOL - I was just being very clear.

The SPEAKER - Thank you so much for the attention to that. I appreciate it.

Ms ROSOL - Speaker, in evidence to a parliamentary inquiry on 28 March, a courageous corrections worker spoke out about the current practice of putting children and young people into adult watch-houses.

Before saying anything further, I would really encourage all members of this house to go back and watch this testimony. What we heard from this corrections worker was brave, compelling and heartbreaking evidence. He talked about how 400 children and young people every year are being placed in adult watch-houses. He described tiny facilities made of concrete with no windows. While children are not put in cells with adults, they are confined in very close quarters and exposed to up to 25 other detainees screaming, yelling, abusing, crying and coming off drugs - undoubtedly a distressing and traumatising environment.

We know the practice of keeping children in adult watch-houses has made national headlines when it has happened on the mainland, especially, in Queensland and the Northern Territory.

In giving his evidence, the corrections worker brought in a printed copy of a recent example of this media reporting, a nationally-reported ABC story published on the 25 March. This story reported on the case of a 15-year-old girl who was forced to spend three days in an adult watch-house after being caught shoplifting. The story includes the National Children's Commissioner describing the practice as a breach of human rights and explaining the damage caused to children who are put in watch-houses. It is a truly scandalous and shocking story, simply devastating. In referring to this case, what did the corrections worker tell the committee? This situation happens weekly in Tasmania. Weekly. Let that sink in for a moment.

Dr Woodruff - Shame.

Ms ROSOL - As if this situation is not appalling enough, workers have not had the training they need to assist and support these children. That is despite repeated requests from the United Workers Union. This is an entirely unacceptable situation.

The Greens are calling for the government to urgently cease the practice of holding children in adult police and corrections facilities. We understand this will not be a simple fix, but it must be done. As a society, we cannot stand by while hundreds of children each year are put in these traumatising facilities. This must be done with real urgency and with real actions taken immediately. We call on the Premier to make sure this happens.


Government's Legislative Agenda

[5.10 p.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I am really pleased to get the jump and speak tonight on the Adjournment - an Adjournment that we, of course, do not need to have this early. There are three hours of this day left for debate, for legislation to be brought on, and yet we have a government that pulls up stumps three hours early. It is clear this government is at the end of the road, but I would have thought it still has some legislation to bring to the parliament.

We said last week during the debate that there was not much business on the blue. What has happened to this government's agenda? They do not have a strong plan for 2030 and they do not have a strong plan for Thursday of this week. In fact, they have no plan whatsoever. They are in complete disarray.

Also, last week at the conclusion of the sitting week, we had disarray on that side when it did not appear that anybody knew what was happening or what time we were supposed to be adjourning, or who was meant to be speaking on what piece of legislation. Mr Ferguson jumped up and spoke on something, and I do not think anyone else knew he was going to do that. There is complete chaos. The Premier's own words have come back to haunt him. Again, that is about this coalition of chaos he has created since the last state election.

The Adjournment has traditionally been a time to debate whether it is fit for the House to adjourn at the end of the day, in my understanding. Of course, we use it as members to speak about important events in our community and to pay tribute to people we think are worthy of being on the parliamentary record in Tasmania. Ultimately, however, this forum in the parliament can be used to debate whether or not we should actually adjourn. 

The government has given no explanation about why it wants to adjourn so early today, why it does not have any business, why it is not moving to the next bill on the blue, which we are ready to debate on this side of the House. We did the preparation to do that this afternoon. However, the Leader of the House just stood up and adjourned the House without any explanation to the parliament about why he was doing that. In fact, he is not even here right now to hear this debate, which is disappointing. You would think he would be here. Perhaps the reason why things are not going so smoothly over that side is because he is not here listening to debate and communicating amongst his members, and perhaps does not have his finger on the pulse when it comes to the comings and goings of this House.

There are numerous pieces of legislation the government could bring on. We go back to 2019 and the review of the Local Government Act. There were changes mooted by this government years ago to improve local government legislation in this state and to improve local government. Since then, they have wasted $3 million on a reform process and we still do not have those legislative changes. We have had consultation about that over the last month or so, but that still has not been brought back to the parliament.

There is also an absurd notion of reviewing legislation and bringing it back to get rid of it, which the Premier spoke about in his state of the state speech earlier this year. We have not heard a lot about that since then. Maybe they are going to fill the agenda by just bringing back legislation they do not see merit in to debate in the House because they have no agenda for the future of Tasmania; no legislative agenda or work for this parliament to do. We have all come from our respective parts of the state to participate in the parliament for this week. We are here and ready to work on behalf of Tasmanians. I think Tasmanians would be disappointed to know that we are pulling up stumps three hours early on their time and money because this government has no agenda.

I urge my fellow parliamentarians to think very clearly about whether we should be adjourning tonight in the absence of any legislative agenda from the government. We have a responsibility to the Tasmanian people. We are not here to waste their time; we are here to work. The government should be here to work. Right now, we are not getting any agenda from the government. You only have to look at the faces on those opposite. I know you are at the end of the road, but that does not mean that you cannot bring forward legislation to this place on behalf of Tasmanians and do your job.


Government's Legislative Agenda

 [5.16 p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Honourable speaker, that was a very competitive jump. 

The SPEAKER - It was. I thought someone might do themselves and injury.

Mr O'BYRNE - I echo the sentiments of a number of the previous speakers on the issue of adjourning early. It is disappointing that the government's legislative agenda has meant that when we all debated the Standing Orders when this parliament was re-formed, Tuesday was the day for government business. We needed to extend the time to allow the work of the government to continue in order to ensure private members' day on the Wednesday could be conducted in an appropriate way and leave time for the Thursday.

It is an indictment on the government that we are here in early April of this parliamentary year on a Tuesday, which is the time for the government to not only outline its legislative agenda but debate and push bills through, and here we are slightly before 5 o'clock moving to the Adjournment debate.

I have been around long enough to know that, at times, when you expect bills to be dealt with by the other place and that does not occur or there are delays, you need to shuffle around and change your orders of the day. However, you can only do that when you have enough orders of the day, bills or matters to be debated.

It is disappointing and I think the government need to have a long hard look at themselves in terms of where we are today. As the previous member said, we are here to work. We also need to remind ourselves that the sum total of our work as parliamentarians is not just negotiating and dealing with bills of the House. We work on matters in a whole range of different forums. It is not the fact that we are stopping work. It is just that the work of the parliament today will finish early, as has been moved by the House.

I make the point that as a crossbencher who has provided confidence and supply to the government, I am disappointed that the legislative agenda has not been managed to the point where we are able to commit and follow through the hours that we all committed to as a parliament when we reformed after the last election. It is not a good look and there is no excuse for it. I am disappointed that we are here on the Adjournment at this early stage, regardless of whether we have a strong interest in any of the matters and bills that have been put before the place either today or in previous sitting weeks. Let the record show that I am really disappointed that we are adjourning our parliamentary day early on a day where it is the government business day. It is the day where we should be working through the important and substantial work of legislation. 

Having said that, I can read the play about what is going on here. I am not going to get engaged in any puerile votes and debates. We know where we are. The government has made its decision. Members have the opportunity on the adjournment to call them to account on that, on the public record, in Hansard, in the community, to say that we are disappointed. No doubt the media will report the fact that we have run out of legislation and work on a government business day. That is a very poor look. It is disappointing that we are in this situation, but I am not going to be engaging in any sort of games in votes on the floor of the House, so I will let the House continue. 


Government's Legislative Agenda
Forestry Tasmania - Autumn Burns

[5.20 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, the Greens have the same view as those expressed by Ms Dow and Dr Broad. It is illustrative of the interest the government has in matters other than making changes to legislation that Tasmania needs to update our huge legislative body of 650 acts. There is so much work that can be done to bring a better Tasmania for people today. Therefore, it speaks volumes about the focus of this government. They had a very long summer break. We have only been back for three weeks and there is absolutely nothing on the bill book. Instead, this government is consumed with flogging off our GBEs, and working full-time, as a government body and as ministers, looking at portfolios and responsibilities to sell off, GBEs to privatise, the sale of which was never discussed with Tasmanians at the last election. There is no mandate. 

They are also consumed with trying to push through a stadium and now, it seems, to push through a new process to fast-track the approval of the stadium, to override the planning process that is in train, to make sure Tasmanians do not get their fair say with the proposed hearings. 

The government is consumed by other matters.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=56.0_D=5.7_C=0.83] It is clear when they have nothing on the books for us. We should be at work. That is what we are here to do.  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=62.0_D=24.3_C=0.79] We had a very long break and it is time to knuckle down. The Greens support getting on with the business and putting a bit of fire under the government's feet and making sure they do the job they are here to do. 

I note that it is April, and the environment-trashing Forestry Tasmania (FT) is gearing up for its annual  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=87.0_D=6.0_C=0.74] cheap-and-nasty burns designed to clean up the remains of forest after they have clear-felled.  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=93.4_D=14.7_C=0.78] These are beautiful native forests that, until recently, were biodiverse wonderlands containing animals and birds, plant communities like we see nowhere else on earth.  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=108.7_D=29.1_C=0.77] These places, when they are clear-felled and burned by Forestry Tasmania, have what FT calls 'waste', which makes up to 50 per cent of the material destroyed in logging operations. We know that about 90 per cent of the myrtle and sassafras, the incredible Tasmanian native hardwoods removed from the coupes, is exported overseas as woodchips. It is a shame.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=138.0_D=25.4_C=0.82] Forestry Tasmania claims the burns are similar to the natural regeneration process that follows a bushfire. That is truly Trumpian in its deception of Tasmanians. They are nothing like that. Forestry Tasmania is planning approximately 140 massive burns. These will blanket Tasmania in health-damaging smoke pollution. Older people and those with respiratory illnesses  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=164.3_D=4.6_C=0.79] are most seriously affected, but everyone is exposed to the small particulate materials [Bookmark: Phr10_O=169.3_D=15.0_C=0.85] . The science shows that no one is immune from the detrimental effects from this smoke pollution. They are very hot burns. They convert the above-and-below-ground carbon remaining in the forest to CO2.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=184.4_D=30.0_C=0.84] That is the CO2 we are doing everything we can as a global community to make sure does not escape into the atmosphere and increase the heating of the planet, which is endangering us all. The estimated burns that Forestry Tasmania have - they estimated that there will be approximately 2 million tonnes annually, or 4 tonnes for every person in Tasmania, of carbon emissions, which is more than all of our vehicle fleet emissions.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=215.3_D=24.0_C=0.83] These fires can and have escaped from Forestry Tasmania's burns in the past. Most famously, they destroyed the biggest tree in Tasmania. They are not only shocking for the climate and for people's health, they also seriously compromise our clean green brand and have serious and negative effects on other industries like tourism, wine production and honey production. We have heard from these businesses and industries in the past about the damaging effects of the massive smoke hazes that blanket huge regions.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=239.7_D=7.3_C=0.83] The Greens will be standing with the wine growers and the beekeepers against these destructive fires. 

Time expired


Early Adjournment

[5.25 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=265.0_D=29.3_C=0.82] Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to speak on the Adjournment about packing up shop nearly three hours early today. In the election, the Premier famously said, 'Don't elect a coalition of chaos. It will crash jobs, it will crash the economy, it will crash the health system.' What he did not tell people was, 'Don't elect a coalition of catnappers.' Instead of the traffic lights in the ad, they just needed a stop sign because they are stopping the business of the House. This is a government that cannot get the fundamentals right. There is no predictability, there is no certainty and they are stuffing things up. They have stuffed the budget. 

The state's finances have never been worse under this government as they have been in recent times. They famously forgot to build berth 3. How do you spend a billion dollars on two new ships and not build the port? It has made Tasmania a laughing stock, not only across the nation but internationally. It has been an international embarrassment. No wonder the TCCI (Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry) said last year that it will be difficult to trust this government again.

They are just some recent examples. They famously said that they were going to reform local government and that anyone who was against them did not have the ticker for reform. What did the Premier do? He backflipped, because he did not have the ticker for reform. He talks a big game, this Premier, but he does not do anything.

This is a government that famously put a northern Tasmanian community through a lot of trauma and spent over $7 million to not build a northern prison. They have spent I do not know how long now - probably nearly close to a decade - speaking about Marinus. I do not know how many millions of dollars they have spent on Marinus to not build a thing. They do a lot of talking over there, but nothing happens.

Famously in Hobart, on the front page of the Mercury in the 2018 election campaign, they promised they were going to build an underground bus mall in Hobart. What happened? Nothing. The Premier, when he was the Infrastructure minister, said it was now at gradient. Nothing has even happened at gradient.

In my electorate further out in the northern suburbs, they were going to pull out all stops to have the northern suburbs rail service running within five years. What is happening at the moment? Tumbleweeds and rusted rail track. I ride along that rail track to parliament every morning on my bike and I can tell you, there is nothing happening there.

This is a government that cannot get the basics right. It has run out of the motivations, the people who got them into government - they have lost some of their best performers - and they have run out of ideas, and time and excuses are catching up with them.

What is the next disaster on the agenda? Privatisation, because they have stuffed the state's finances. The Premier walked in here this year with a thought bubble. There were no formed-up proposals; no detail to any of them. He walked in here and said he has a plan, that with his privatisation plan he is going to fix the state's finances that he has effectively bankrupted. Totally misguided. He knows that Tasmanians do not support privatisation because he did not take it to the election. He knows if he did, he would have actually been kicked out of office. That is how unpopular it is. 

He knows that there is no pathway through the parliament, so what is he doing right now? Inertia: using up government resources for a plan he cannot implement; a plan that he will backflip on eventually because it is all too hard and he does not have the ticker for it. 

We are here tonight ready to work and where are they? Who knows. They have the stop sign up. There is no business before the House. Who knows what is going to happen when we get back because they tabled one bill today. We might get through the rest of this week, but they have some serious problems with their agenda this year. They talk about a 2030 strong plan. There is no strong plan; there is no agenda from this government. They have run out of the ideas and the things that got them into government and it is all catching up with them now.


Tasmania Police Academy Graduates

[5.30 p.m.]
Mr ELLIS (Braddon - Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Management) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to congratulate the amazing Tasmanian men and women who graduated from our Police Academy on Friday. Tasmania Police are Australia's most trusted and over the course of this next week, we will welcome new constables into our ranks. They will be straight out onto the front line, serving in our busy 24/7 stations in Hobart, Launceston, Burnie and Devonport.

They have undertaken rigorous training of 28 weeks, which includes operational skills and academic work but also learning how to deal with some of Tasmania's most vulnerable people in some of their most difficult moments. Being a police officer requires the highest degree of integrity but also resilience, empathy and compassion. We look to them in some of our most difficult moments across the community. With our new recruits, I am sure that they will continue t [Bookmark: Phr2_O=28.3_D=8.2_C=0.66] he legacy and record of integrity that is so central to Tasmania Police's nation-leading reputation.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=37.0_D=29.6_C=0.79] We welcome all of our amazing graduates, but I would particularly like to highlight the winners of our awards who across their rigorous training have stepped up and gone above and beyond. The UTAS Emerging Leader Award went to Constable Charlie Strochnetter and Constable Blake Tanton. The UTAS Vulnerability Advocacy Award went to Constable Kate McMaster and Constable Callan Sexton. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=66.9_D=14.6_C=0.84]  The Rod Warrington APM Award for Operational Skills - and a big shout out to Rod, 45 years in Tasmania police and still going strong. What an icon and what a legend. His award went to Constable Nicholas Taylor.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=81.9_D=30.0_C=0.75] The Retired Police Association of Tasmania Communications Award went to Constable Eleanor Bonner. The Sean Pullen Memorial Award for Team Spirit - and every graduation we pay tribute to Sean Pullen and thank his family for their ongoing support - went to Constable Callan Sexton. The Commissioner Darren Hine Award for Outstanding Commitment to Physical Fitness, Health and Wellbeing went to Constable Olivia Perry and Constable Royce Reed. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=112.0_D=28.4_C=0.78]  The Police Association of Tasmania AR Henley Award for Personal Achievement went to Constable Charlie Strochnetter. The Commander's Award, incorporating the Order of the British Empire Tasmania Association Book Award, went to Constable Jacob Morris. At the very top of the list for academic achievement over the course of their studies: the runner-up dux of the course was Constable Kate McMaster. Congratulations [Bookmark: Phr8_O=142.3_D=29.4_C=0.85]  on an outstanding effort. Kate is a Victorian police officer who has come down here to beautiful Tasmania to keep our community safe. The dux of the course went to Constable Callan Sexton and we congratulate all of those award winners. 

More broadly, we congratulate every graduate from the Police Academy as part of this course. It was so exciting to see the two other courses that were there on the parade ground - around 70 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=172.2_D=26.1_C=0.81]  Tasmania Police coming through, a record number of police now in our state and a record pipeline of recruitment, which is so encouraging. I thank all of the family, friends and supporters who were there and who have supported our recruits over the course of their studies. It can be difficult supporting someone going through the academy. They may be living away from home. They may be living away from [Bookmark: Phr10_O=198.9_D=1.8_C=0.87]  partners, children, spouses [Bookmark: Phr11_O=201.1_D=29.9_C=0.85]  and the people who love them the most, so being able to support them on this incredible journey sets those police officers up for success as they go out across our beautiful communities.

To our community, if you see some of our new police graduates in your community, please stop and say 'G'day'. As I mentioned before, Tasmania's finest is Australia's most trusted, and the relationship that we have between our police officers [Bookmark: Phr12_O=231.1_D=15.8_C=0.90]  and the broader community is what makes it so special being a Tasmanian police officer. What is so rewarding about one of the most difficult jobs that there is that you can connect with beautiful people and beautiful communities across all walks of life and help to keep them safe.

The SPEAKER - There are nine minutes left. Early Adjournment has seemed to bring out the speakers in you all.


Early Adjournment

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=249.5_D=8.5_C=0.63] [5.35 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - [Bookmark: Phr14_O=258.5_D=11.6_C=0.77]  Honourable Speaker, I rise to speak about the early Adjournment. I had to go to a brief meeting, but has anybody from the government explained to the House why we are adjourning nearly three hours early? [Bookmark: Phr15_O=271.9_D=17.0_C=0.81]  No one - not the leader of government business, not the minister who just spoke, not anyone from the government can explain why instead of going through the blue today, we are here adjourning almost three hours early. The Land Use Planning and Approvals Amendment (Sensitive Disclosures) Bill is still on the blue and yet we are not going to it. Why not? [Bookmark: Phr16_O=290.0_D=15.0_C=0.73]  

The so-called strong plan is in tatters. The so-called strong plan has delivered 9000 full-time jobs that have been lost since this government went into minority for the first time. The so-called 'strong plan', such as it is, is not being delivered at all. This is a government that said there would be a tax on Airbnb properties, a short-stay levy. We have not seen anything from the government about it. In fact, they seem to have gone quiet. The Leader of the House said on election night that he thought it was the sort of policy that did the Liberals no good. Perhaps that is why Mr Abetz is pushing back against the government's so-called agenda.

I remember when they had a policy, a stability clause that they were going to bring to these places - a stability clause, where they were going to kick out members of parliament who switched sides. Where is the bill? We are ready to work. Where are they? Where is this government? They are walking out the door.

This reminds me of one of the most farcical days I have seen in this place, when the then leader of government business, Mr Ellis, stood up in this place after a day where the government could not get through a single skerrick of business, and simply adjourned the House. Then they brought us back. They petitioned the Governor to bring the parliament back for one day only, they presented no business for the House to do, and then simply adjourned before we even got to Question Time. That is where we are again today. The Premier said he was taking us back to an election because the House had become unworkable. He has made this House unworkable because he does not have any work to do.

We are ready to work. We are here. We are supposed to be here until 7.30 p.m., and yet we have a government that is literally escaping out the door. The Leader of the House, who is supposed to present us with an agenda and then deliver on it, is walking out the door.

Dr Woodruff - Shame.

Mr WINTER - We are ready to work. The government needs to bring an agenda to this place, and the approach that they have taken today and last week, and let us face it, they were only saved by the Greens moving a stunt motion last week from this happening last Thursday.

Tomorrow, we have private members' business. Today, they tabled one bill. Where are we going to get to on Thursday? Is this going to be a repeated pattern? Are they going to have to start cancelling sittings because they do not have an agenda?

This is the Liberal government, the minority Liberal government, led by a Premier who has no agenda, and who is letting every single Tasmanian down.


Early Adjournment

[5.39 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I will add my voice to the discussion about adjourning early. It simply is not good enough. We are paid to do our work in this place. We are all here. We have come from every corner of the state to do that work. It is just not good enough to be adjourning three hours short of the time that was set.

The business of the House is in shambles. Last night we were informed of the business and the list included the Electoral Amendment Bill which still has just two small changes that have come down from the Legislative Council. I know on our side of things we are certainly ready to go. It also had the Land Use Planning Bill in reserve. My understanding of the notion of 'in reserve' would be to debate in exactly this kind of situation. We have the time to debate the bill; if it is there sitting in reserve, we actually debate it. That is the stuff that we know is before us in the first place.

I want to mention some passion projects that this House should be doing and this government should be working on. I will mention again, I take every opportunity I can to do this, but things like the Aboriginal Heritage Act 1975. The Aboriginal Heritage Act has been under review for almost 20 years. The Aboriginal Heritage Act has been substantially under review by this government for probably five or six years. The former minister, Mr Jaensch, came into this House three and a half years ago and tabled a formal report about that review, that says, in essence, that the Aboriginal Heritage Act does not work. It does not protect Aboriginal heritage. It is woefully inadequate. It simply does not work.

It needs to include things like Aboriginal cultural landscapes. It needs to include things like spiritual values. It needs to empower Aboriginal people to actually make the decisions about their own heritage and yet what do we have? We still have a government that is allowing large, destructive developments to go forward and be assessed against that inadequate Aboriginal Heritage Act.

Here we are standing before the Aboriginal flag. Here we are acknowledging traditional owners every single day when we come into this place. This government cannot even do the work, cannot even pay the respect to actually bring in legislation that will properly consider their ancestral heritage and put it before us.

This is the kind of thing that we, the Tasmanians, expect this government to be getting on with. They want this government to be getting on with the things that matter, not pursuing agendas that, at the end of the day, they did not even take to the election.

That includes things like the fire sale of GBEs. We knew there was a conversation that needed to be had about GBEs. The Spirit saga showed up exactly how flawed the management is and how there absolutely needs to be an independent review of GBEs. Out of that there may well come some structural amendments and structural changes that need to be made to the GBE act and other acts to address these issues. Instead, they come into this House in the state of the state speech and slap on the table here an agenda to privatise our public assets - everything except the Hydro, we are told.

Indeed, it is not just GBEs and state-owned companies. As has been explained, inexplicably it is reaching into government departments and reaching in to pull out things like the Land Titles Office to try to earn a buck or two out of that as well. It is simply not good enough that we are here with nothing to do. It is very clear to us that the reason we are not debating the Land Use Planning and Approvals Amendment (Sensitive Disclosures) Bill today in reserve, as was listed on the blue and as was discussed with leaders of business and whips, is because they need to hold it over till Thursday so that they have something to put on the blue on Thursday.

It is simply not good enough. I will not speak any longer so that anyone else has an opportunity to talk to it, but we certainly believe the government should be sent a message that they need to do better, they need to do more work, they need to put us to work, and they need to get on with making the reforms that Tasmanians need and deserve.

The SPEAKER - Thank you. I will take the member for Clark, Ms Haddad. I will let the member for Clark resume his seat know that the Third Reading of the Electoral Amendment Bill has not taken place, so it is not here for us to debate.


Early Adjournment

[5.43 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I am told there is a minute left. How pathetic. How pathetic that here we are adjourning early. We have extended the sitting hours for Tuesdays and Wednesdays. We are actually meant to be here until 8.30 p.m. - a 7.30 p.m. Adjournment for an 8.30 p.m. finish.

I reckon those guys across there looked forward to people moving a no confidence motion or censure motion, because at least it takes up the time of the house. They look forward to us bringing on private members bills because at least they do not have to worry about what we are going to do at work that day. They have lost all of their performers - Hodgman gone, Gutwein gone, Courtney gone, Ferguson to the backbench - and they cannot cope. They cannot do the work of the House. It is pathetic, Speaker.
This might surprise you, but I am actually starting to miss Elise Archer. You know what - it does surprise the Speaker, I can see that - there were not many times when she and I agreed on policy in this place. There were probably more times than not that we did not agree, but at least she had an agenda.

Time expired. 

Ms Haddad - At least she brought bills to this place and did the work.

The SPEAKER (Ms O'Byrne) - The member will resume the seat. The question is -

That the House do now adjourn.

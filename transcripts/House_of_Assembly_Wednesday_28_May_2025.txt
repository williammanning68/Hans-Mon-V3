QUESTIONS

Spirit of Tasmania IV and V - Engine Issues

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.01 a.m.]
You have completely stuffed up the Spirits project. You have been caught out providing nearly $100 million of secret bailout payments to a Finnish shipbuilder. You forgot to build a berth for the new ships so they cannot be used for years. As a result, it is costing our economy $500 million every year. You have spent millions of dollars hiding the ships in Scotland, the cost of the berth has blown out from $90 million to $493 million, and you attempted to lease our ships out as a floating refugee camp before the minister Abetz was tricked by a shipbroker. Now, you tell us that the ships might not even work and there is a huge problem with the LNG engines. This is a fiasco of unbelievable proportions. What on earth is going on?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. This side of the House looks forward to the vessels arriving in Tasmanian shores.

Mr Winter -Bring them here, then. You are the one hiding them in Scotland.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Mr Abetz released a media statement a few moments ago, in full transparency and -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - updated the Tasmanian people with respect to a technical issue detected on board Spirit IV and Spirit V by Finnish-based shipbuilder Rauma Marine Constructions (RMC) in relation to its liquified natural gas (LNG) system. The issue was identified, as the minister said, with respect to sea trials on Spirit V and RMC has advised TT-Line that the issue needs further assessment and rectification. As a result, Spirit IV will not depart for Australia until the work is completed.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - It is actually not a conversation across the Chamber. The Premier is answering the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - In my view, the reason why you do sea trials is to rectify any mechanical or technical issues so that when you bring the ships to Tasmania, they are delivered safely for the vessels and, most importantly, for the crew.

An issue was detected on Spirit V. Then, you go to Spirit IV to ensure that the issue is rectified there in the interest of crew safety. I am not sure what the member is saying we should do, 'Don't worry about it, no trials. Bring it back to Tasmania.'

Mr Winter - It should have been here six - it should have been here years ago.

Mr ROCKLIFF - What this highlights is the Leader of the Opposition's irresponsibility -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left, this is a serious question.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - In his answer, the Premier talked about being excited about when the ship will arrive. Can he give us a date the ship will arrive?

The SPEAKER - It does arise from the answer the Premier gave.

Mr ROCKLIFF - As the minister has said, the government is awaiting further details in relation to a new expected departure date, but it is understood that this work will take some time. When we find the information, we will be able to inform the Tasmanian community. It is important that the matter identified in a trial - which is why you have trials - is addressed. 


Spirit of Tasmania - New Vessels Project Management

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.06 a.m.]
You cannot even tell Tasmanians when our ships we spent nearly $1 billion on will finally arrive in Tasmania. After everything that has happened, after all the cost blowouts, delays and debacles, how can this parliament have any confidence in you and your government now we have learnt that there is yet another serious problem with this project?

ANSWER

The reason you have trials is to rectify any issues that require attention in the interest of safety first and foremost, and to ensure when the vessels arrive, they are arriving on our shores in a safe manner. This is about supporting the crew safety.

Mr Winter - Did you know that the minister was putting that statement out this morning?
Mr ROCKLIFF - Yes, honestly. It is important that we released the information and it is there in an open and transparent way -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left, you have asked the question and you are getting an answer.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You constantly come in here and talk the project down, talk Tasmania down, make up stuff in your questions, which you have in your opening question today. I said we would fix the GBEs, sort the Spirits and back our tourism industry, and that is exactly what we have done.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - In the answer to the question, the Premier said that I was making stuff up in the questions. Could he outline to the House which part of my question was incorrect?

The SPEAKER - The Premier did make the statement. I will call you to address the question.

A member - There is a one-hour limit on Question Time.

A member - Only one minute.

The SPEAKER - I do not need help from members on my right.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Mr Winter, you have a lot of form in regard to coming in here with accusations, changing positions - 

Mr Winter - Which bit was wrong?

The SPEAKER - Members have opportunities to ask further questions.

Mr ROCKLIFF - making things up that impact on the economy, as an example. This is true to form for you -

Mr Winter - So, it was all true, was it not? 

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ROCKLIFF - True to form, talk Tasmania down, talk projects down. You have nothing whatsoever behind you in terms of policy. In fact, you now say policy on Monday night and refused to talk about it yesterday in parliament because we found you out.

Members interjecting.
The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We found you out because -

Ms DOW - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance.

The SPEAKER - I believe the Premier was addressing the answer, so he was being relevant at the time. Has the Premier concluded his answer?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Mm.


Takayna Four-Wheel Drive Tracks

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF 

[10.00 a.m.]
We welcome your government's announcement to establish and fund a Truth-Telling and Healing Commission and commissioners. However, we share the deep disappointment of many Tasmanian Aboriginal people that you appear to have abandoned your promise of a treaty.

On top of that devastating broken promise, last week - the week before Reconciliation Week - your government announced that it would spend $10 million to reopen the Takayna four-wheel drive tracks, against the advice of your statutory Aboriginal Heritage Council. We do not have to tell you, but in case you have forgotten, the Takayna coast is one of Lutruwita's most precious, ancient Aboriginal cultural landscapes. Your decision puts cultural heritage at risk and will drag the Aboriginal community through court challenges all over again. Will you abandon the reopening of these tracks and bring in an Aboriginal heritage bill? Can we expect that the Truth-Telling Commission will have more money allocated on it than the vandalism of the Takayna coast?

The SPEAKER - The member's time for asking the question has expired.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question; there are a lot of questions within the question. First, I am very pleased with our government's ongoing commitment to closing the gap and setting up the Truth-Telling and Healing Commission, if I can call it that, which has been welcomed by many Tasmanian Aboriginal people. As I have said many times in this place before, it is important that Tasmanian Aboriginal people, with their lived experience, tell their story and their truth, and that goes to healing.

Through that process, there is education for the broader Tasmanian community as well. It is so fundamentally important to get an understanding and appreciation of the hurt of our First Nations people in Tasmania and the Tasmanian Aboriginal people and the consequences that they suffered as a result of colonisation. Through that healing process we are able to move forward and address the issues that are so fundamentally important.

It does concern me, as I said a number of times throughout the referendum debate, that our incarceration rates for Tasmanian Aboriginal people are far too high. Life expectancy is a lot lower for Tasmanian Aboriginal people, educational attainment is a lot lower, as is health. That is why this process is very important - a Tasmanian Aboriginal-led journey towards truth-telling, towards healing and relationship building with Tasmanian Aboriginal people and the broader Tasmanian community, as I said. This is a first and historic step forward for Tasmania, a moment of deep significance for Tasmanian Aboriginal people and one that echoes our state's commitment to reconciliation.

The matters that you refer to about tracks and others have been through some deep discussion for a number of years. There has been investment in the areas that you speak of when it comes to those particular areas. The strategy does not plan or recommend any new off-road vehicle tracks. I want to make that very clear.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - I thank the Premier for his considered response. In relation to the question I asked about abandoning the four-wheel drive track, which is another form of colonisation and against the advice of your statutory Aboriginal Heritage Council, will you take their advice and abandon the four-wheel drive tracks that have been proposed?

Mr ROCKLIFF - As I was speaking of, the strategy does not plan or recommend any new off-road vehicle tracks.

Mr Bayley - It is still opposed by your two statutory advisory bodies.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, deputy. It is focused on developing sustainable management outcomes for the existing tracks and improved recreational experiences for users and visitors to the Arthur-Pieman Conservation Area and the broader west coast. Consultation with key stakeholders, including Tasmanian Aboriginal people, is ongoing and will continue as part of the implementation of the strategy. Parks and Wildlife Service work continues to be subject to robust planning process which includes Aboriginal heritage assessments.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Cost Breakdown

Ms JOHNSTON question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.14 a.m.]
Minister Abetz told parliament yesterday that the stadium was only 50 per cent designed. That is still a lot of unknowns. He also said the project's costs have blown out by whopping $170 million to $945 million after receiving a robust assessment from a quantity surveyor. You expect MPs to vote on the stadium in just a few weeks, but the enabling legislation report has nowhere near enough detail for anyone to make a sensible decision on such a huge investment for Tasmania.

Absent from the report is an updated, detailed breakdown of capital costs and updated operating costs - basic information Tasmanians need to know and expect MPs to know before we vote. Will you, as a matter of urgency, release by Friday the information you receive from a quantity surveyor as well as any other updated information on the capital costs and operating costs?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. We will provide as much information as possible for the Tasmanian people over the coming weeks. This is an open and transparent process. It has been a well-scrutinised project for the last three years. Whatever information is out there, whatever the process of ensuring you are obtaining that information, whatever scrutiny, whatever information - you are never going to support this project.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - That is a great shame, because my reading of your constituency is that it will benefit enormously from this development. Mr Willie nods his head in agreement for once about something that I have said, because Mr Willie at least understands his electorate, as does Mr Behrakis and Ms Ogilvie very clearly, and understands what this can do for young people. Ms Haddad, too, sorry.

The SPEAKER - Could you do all the members of Clark for equity, please? 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - We will draw the Premier back to the question that has been asked.

Mr ROCKLIFF - There was an enormous amount of information put out yesterday, Ms Johnston - information that took consideration of the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) panel's concerns and the concerns of the Tasmanian people who submitted their information and their thoughts by 8 May. I said that the legislation tabled yesterday by the minister takes into account people's responses to the Project of State Significance (POSS) process and submission process. It is very thorough in that. There will be a lot of scrutiny when the legislation comes through the parliaments, I do not doubt, from your good self, and there will be the answers provided by the minister and no doubt others during that time. 

I accept the fact that you will never support the project. It is disappointing for your electorate, but nonetheless, we are going to proceed with this project.

The enabling legislation, as I said yesterday, was not my preferred option. The Major Projects legislation was the preferred option. Parliament went into minority, and we went through the Project of State Significance process, and now we need to adhere to the timelines of the project.

Supplementary Question

Ms JOHNSTON - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will take the supplementary question from the member for Clark.
Ms JOHNSTON - It goes to the original question, whether the Premier would commit to, as a matter of urgency, releasing the quantity surveyor's report, as well as any other updated information and capital costs and operating costs. The cost has increased significantly over the last week or so. It is critically important that Tasmanians and members of parliament know exactly where you are spending their money. Will you release detailed costs of the capital costs and operating costs before we vote? 

The SPEAKER - The time for the supplementary question has expired. I was not sure I was going to rule that one in, but as the Premier is approaching the lectern, the Premier can answer that question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We want all the information out there. It has been so well scrutinised. We have had a Public Accounts Committee for the last - how many years? Two-and-a-half years, probably, to which treasurers and premiers and others have submitted information and been scrutinised about this. As information is available, of course we will ensure that the Tasmanian people and the parliament can digest that information and make informed decisions.


Bruny Island Ferry - Timetable and Community Needs

Mr O'BYRNE question to the MINISTER for TRANSPORT, Mr ABETZ

[10.20 a.m.]
The Bruny Island ferry operation has been buckling under the weight of increasing demand for years. This issue will only get worse. The proposed Bruny Island ferry winter timetable has resulted in a major community backlash. Reduced services impact residents' ability to get to work, education, sporting activities and essential services.

To your credit, you agreed to review the changes, and some amendments were made to the timetable. However, since then the situation has become worse, with residents experiencing extremely long waits for ferries and businesses suffering thousands of dollars in lost revenue. Residents are now routinely waiting two hours to get on a ferry due to the number of people waiting to get off the island. School trips have also been impacted. Residents and businesses have had enough.

Will you not only act to fix the timetable, but will you agree to a broader review and assessment of the needs of the Bruny Island community, the businesses on the island and the broader Tasmanian tourism industry?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. Both of us have the privilege of representing the people of Franklin, which includes the good burghers of Bruny Island, and the messages that the member just read out from Bruny islanders are not surprising to me, because they are exactly the same messages that I have received as well.

For those who do not know, it is the Transport Commissioner who does the contracting with SeaLink, and the commissioner and SeaLink came up with a winter timetable. When that was announced, the feedback from the community was strong. As a result of that, I made certain representations, and I am sure others did as well, and certain adjustments were made.
It appears that the morning section of the winter timetable is workable. It is quite apparent that the afternoon timetable is not workable. I took the view that we would see how the timetable would work from 5 May, if I recall correctly, when it started for a fortnight, and it would be fair to say it did not take a fortnight for the community feedback to come back, be it from Rob Pennicott, the school community or the medical community.

It was overwhelmingly strong. Sometimes it is difficult to unite an island community, but can I tell you, that did. As a result, I had a roundtable in my office first thing Monday morning with various representatives of Bruny Island, and as a result of that - and I am not in a position to say anything at this stage - certain representations have now been made to the Transport Commissioner and I am awaiting a decision in relation to that.

That is the current situation. In relation to a broader review, I think there needs to be, if I might say, speaking more as a member for Franklin rather than just Minister for Transport, a full review of all matters Bruny Island. For example, the burgeoning tourism industry is such that toilet and rubbish facilities are completely over-utilised, if I can use that term. They are insufficient. Some of the roads, et cetera - look, when I was a kid Bruny Island did not have chocolate or cheese or a winery or the raspberry farm, et cetera.

It is now a must-go place for tourism, and Rob Pennicott has really put it on the map. I think the total infrastructure issue for Bruny Island needs addressing, and that will be a whole-of-government issue in relation to transport, bearing mind that the current contract ends in 2028 and now might be the time for some planning for the future. 

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired.


Spirit of Tasmania IV and V - Engine Issues

Mr WINTER question to MINSTER for TRANSPORT, Mr ABETZ

[10.24 a.m.]
You have shared a statement this morning saying there had been a problem with Spirit V's LNG system. Can you outline for the House exactly what the problem is and how long it will take to rectify? Was there an emergency shutdown recently on either of the two new Spirits? How long will this mean Spirit IV will be stuck in Scotland as an international embarrassment?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. As indicated by the Premier, as is our wont, as a result of our commitment to transparency, a statement was issued this morning as a result of information received yesterday evening. 

To echo that which the Premier said, Spirit V has still not come into our possession. Sea trials are continuing. It is about 98.5 per cent complete. However, we do not take ownership until such time as the sea trials have been undertaken and everything is deemed to be in order. During that sea trial, it became apparent that there were problems with the LNG system. I am no mechanic, I am not able to give you which nut or bolt needs to be adjusted -

Members interjecting.
The SPEAKER - Members on my left, the minister is actually answering the question. 

Mr ABETZ - or whether a gasket needs to be replaced. We allow the mechanics and those in the know to deal with that. However, what became apparent was that if there was this fault on Spirit V, it was very likely that there was a similar fault on Spirit IV, which we have taken possession of -

Members interjecting.

Mr ABETZ - The good news is - and instead of talking it down all the time, Leader of the Opposition, why do you not say, 'Thank goodness she is under warranty and' -

Mr Winter - Oh, honestly.

Mr ABETZ - He says 'Oh'. What did you expect us to do? Take a defective ship and not use the warranty to fix it? Really? Is that your commercial knowledge, Leader of the Opposition?

Mr Winter - You think you should be congratulated for this?

Mr ABETZ - No sensible Tasmanian would think that that is a good idea -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order. Minister. The House will come to order. Interjections have historically happened because people are frustrated they are not getting answers. You are actually getting an answer. The minister is not being helped by people on his side either. This is an important issue for Tasmania. The minister will be heard in silence. 

Mr ABETZ - Thank you, Speaker. If one of us bought a new car and it was under warranty and it had a mechanical problem, would we not all say, 'Thank goodness for the warranty, take it back to the dealership and have it fixed'? Is that not just common sense? I would have thought that is a no-brainer, yet the Leader of the Opposition, who seeks to dance around everywhere as being in cahoots with business, shows his complete ignorance of the most basic of commercial deals - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ABETZ - which the vast majority of Tasmanians engage in in relation to motor vehicles. This is just a lot bigger. It is a ship, but the same principles apply. The Leader of the Opposition and, indeed, all Tasmanians, can be satisfied that the new management and board of TT-Line- 

Mr Winter - And the new minister, is that right?

Mr ABETZ - have this in hand and are ensuring that we get the best possible value for Tasmanians.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - I have a supplementary question, Speaker.

The SPEAKER - I will hear a supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - It is the rest of the question that he did not answer. Was there an emergency shutdown on either of the two new Spirits recently? How long will it take for Spirit IV to be stuck in Scotland as an international embarrassment?

The SPEAKER - I will draw the minister to the parts of the original question.

Mr ABETZ - Spirit IV was designed, or timetabled, I should say, to leave on 26 May, on Monday. Inclement weather did not allow that to occur. There appeared to be a window of opportunity about midday Wednesday, Scotland time, for the vessel to leave. In the meantime, we became aware of the problem with Spirit V. As a result, TT-Line is now considering the options and - 

Mr Winter - If it was not for the weather, it would be on its way?

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ABETZ - the best way of dealing with the issue. I say thank goodness for the weather, because she might have been well into the deep oceans and then suffer a mechanical issue, the full extent of which I am not appraised of.

Mr Winter - So you were saved by the weather?

Ms Finlay - How do warranties work on cars, minister? Do they cease at handover? What is your commercial knowledge of these issues?

Mr ABETZ - However, we want to make sure the ship is safe and, even more importantly -

Mr Winter - Was there an emergency shutdown?

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass and Leader of the Opposition. 

Mr ABETZ - the crew is safe. We will do whatever is necessary to ensure the protection of the crew - 

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired.

Members interjecting

The SPEAKER - I am going to have some silence so that we can hear the question from the Leader of the Greens. 
Algal Bloom - Bruny and Maria Islands

Dr WOODRUFF question to the MINISTER for the ENVIRONMENT, Ms OGILVIE

[10.29 a.m.]
Tasmania's marine ecosystem is in the midst of collapse. Recently, we have seen unprecedented blooms of jellyfish, salp and algae in south-east waters, a formerly exotic bacteria that killed millions of farmed salmon, dead sardines washed up in Sandy Bay, and the oyster industry wiped out at Pipe Clay Lagoon. 

Right now, a toxic algal bloom is poisoning shellfish from at least Maria Island to the west of Bruny Island. Commercial shellfishing has been closed down due to the serious health threat of paralytic shellfish poisoning. Recreational fishers should also be warned, but we found no warnings other than a Health department Facebook post two weeks ago; nothing from you as Minister for the Environment. 

In South Australia, a toxic algal bloom has wiped out millions of marine creatures. We have no idea if this algae is the same species, but whatever is happening in our waters is deadly. The community is desperate for the government to protect them. Will you recognise the gravity of this catastrophe and tell us what actions you will take to hold the crisis? 

The SPEAKER - The member's time for asking the question has expired. 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. That was a very, very long question which had many elements in it. I remind the member that it crosses a number of portfolios, so I will endeavour to give you the answers you have sought today, from my perspective in particular. 

You seem to want to conflate the salmon mortality issue with an algae bloom issue. They are actually two quite different elements -

Dr Woodruff - They actually are not. They are linked. That is the point.

Ms OGILVIE - They actually are. In this Chamber, we have been through quite a large event with salmon mortalities. I make a callout to everybody who works in the salmon industry to say well done on your management of that. It was a very difficult time. I know a lot of the workforce personally. They are great football players and I know them from down the Huon in my footy days. That management has been well constructed, well done, and well managed. It was obviously an area of great community concern. The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has managed this -

Dr WOODRUFF - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. We are talking about the marine collapse and whether the minister will recognise the gravity, and what action she will take. 

The SPEAKER - The member does not get to make an argument. The question was about the actions the minister would be taking and what advice you will provide. I draw the minister to the question. 
Ms OGILVIE - Absolutely. The EPA, which I have spoken about many times in this Chamber, has its independent organisational remit to manage these things. That is who we look to manage these things. 

I note the language you have used in relation to what you refer to as 'marine collapse'. I have not read that before. That seems to be something that you have just constructed, perhaps. 

Dr Woodruff - That is what is happening in South Australia, and we have this toxic algal bloom.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Ms OGILVIE - It is just seeking to inflate concern for political reasons in relation to what we do here and how we manage our environment. 

I also note that I believe this is only maybe the second question the Greens have asked me on the environment as Environment minister. I have been quite concerned about where you have been during all of these questions. I am quite concerned about that and -

Dr Woodruff - We have asked quite a lot of questions about the environment. It is kind of pointless asking you because you never answer them.

The SPEAKER - The Leader of the Greens will cease her interjections and the member will come to the question. 

Ms OGILVIE - caring and working for the environment, and doing things that really matter, particularly about climate change -

Dr Woodruff - Talking about football when we are talking about the marine collapse.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Ms OGILVIE - We have done a lot of work on that. What we are doing is engaging people in the industry and the different sectors in this dialogue we need to have as a state that cares deeply about our environment, and we take that role really seriously -

Dr Woodruff - Why have you not told recreational fishers about the risk to their health?

Ms OGILVIE - We take a prime voice at the Environment ministers' table and we are leading those conversations -

The SPEAKER - The Leader of the Greens will cease her interjections, and the minister's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - The minister talked about the EPA managing the situation. The EPA gave out a warning saying that the dead sardines were due to Pilchard orthomyxovirus (POMV). Then the Chief Veterinary Officer came out and said it was much more likely to be a toxic algal bloom. What is the problem with the EPA and why are they not being transparent with Tasmanians, providing all the information about what is going on in our marine environment?

The SPEAKER - I will draw the minister to the question about the EPA's engagement and role.
 
Ms OGILVIE - Fantastically displayed your lack of knowledge about who manages which part of the environmental issues. 

Dr Woodruff - Why are we getting different information from three different departments?

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Ms OGILVIE - Dead sardines in relation - it is very difficult if you ask a question and I am endeavouring to answer it. Perhaps you would like to listen. I thought you cared about the environment.

Dr Woodruff - Why do you not answer the question?

The SPEAKER - I am going to draw the minister the question and remind members to cease their interjections.

Ms OGILVIE - I am happy to have the dialogue.

The SPEAKER - I am not happy for a dialogue, I want the answer and then people to resume their seats.

Ms OGILVIE - The issue of the sardines actually sits with another minister. That is obviously something that you kind of managed to not notice during -

Dr Woodruff - You manage the EPA.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens, please.

Ms OGILVIE - No, I do not manage the EPA, the EPA is an independent organisation and as I have said before -

Dr Woodruff - Honourable Speaker, would you draw the minister to talk through you so that she does not incite interjections?

Ms OGILVIE - I would never seek to direct the EPA. They do their work, they do it independently, rigorously, and according to the science. In relation to the sardine incident, that sits with another minister -

Dr Woodruff - No it does not, it is Environment.
The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Ms OGILVIE - You have mentioned the Chief Veterinary officer. You do know that. You are aware of that because you said it in your question. You are trying to conflate these things. When we are talking about the environment and talking about our marine environment, it is very important -

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired. Before I give the call to anyone, I advise ministers that it is much easier if they direct their answers through the Chair so as to limit the level of responses that we are getting from members across the Chamber.

Macquarie Point Development - Housing Plan

Mr GARLAND question to MINISTER for SPORT and EVENTS, Mr DUIGAN, referred to MINISTER for HOUSING and PLANNING, Mr ELLIS

[10.36 p.m.]
A year ago you entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth Government where they agreed to contribute $240 million towards the cost of the Macquarie Point development. It was a condition of the agreement that your government deliver housing at Macquarie Point, including a portion set aside as affordable, essential worker or social housing. The agreement requires delivery of a finalised housing plan by 30 June 2025. What is the status of the housing plan? When will it be made public? Will you make that 30 June deadline and what will happen to that $240 million if you do not?

The SPEAKER - I am not quite sure which portfolio we are dealing with this under, but I will give the minister the call, and he can answer it as best he can or refer it to another appropriate minister if that is the case. 

Mr DUIGAN - Thank you, Speaker. I appreciate that direction. I think this is potentially one for my colleague, minister Ellis as the Minister for Housing and Planning, rather than under my remit of Sports and Events.

The SPEAKER - The minister has the capacity to refer the question to another minister. Minister, I think he has just reverted to you.

Mr Ellis - Do you want me to answer it now?

The SPEAKER - I think that would be appropriate; it is Question Time. A little bit of how-we-go with this: we ask questions; we try and get answers.

ANSWER

It is actually my first experience with a throw from the Floor, Speaker. I thank the member for his question. There are significant opportunities at that site. We are working through the planning legislation for the site as a whole and the arrangements with the federal government. 

We have made significant progress as far as securing key worker accommodation just next to the Macquarie Point site, with the purchase of the Fountainside Hotel, which has secured key worker accommodation, particularly for those people working in our health sector. That is a major investment and it is ensured that those workers no longer would be required to potentially take up other spots within the housing market. It is based right next to Macquarie Point. It is also based right next to the Royal Hobart Hospital.

Mr GARLAND - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. Please answer the question. What is the status of the housing plan? When will it be made public? Will you meet that 30 June deadline? What will happen -

The SPEAKER - The member does not get to re-ask the question, but I will draw the minister to the original question which was about the provision of housing and the contract arrangements.

Mr Garland - On Mac Point.

The SPEAKER - At Mac Point.

Mr ELLIS - As I mentioned, we made a range of significant investments just next door at the Fountainside Hotel, which has secured key worker accommodation. We will continue to work with the federal government as far as the opportunities that are available to us for housing at that site. There are a range of different opportunities. 

We have spoken about unlocking commercial value in the surrounding precinct. I suppose that is one of the important things to note for members when we are debating this important matter: would you rather build housing next to a wasteland, or would you rather build housing near somewhere that is extremely attractive.

Mr Bayley - Build it on the wasteland like you were going to. The previous plan was building housing on the wasteland.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader of the Greens.

Mr ELLIS - That is a vibrant cultural and sporting centre that people are flocking to, that will also unlock transport opportunities for those people in the local area. That is one of the things that I think we need to remember in this debate. This is an urban renewal opportunity. 

Mr Bayley - Where is the plan you signed up to? You have no plan, have you?

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader of the Greens.

Mr ELLIS - If we do not deliver this game-changing infrastructure for that site, we are essentially kissing other major opportunities goodbye.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the questions has expired. 


Spirit of Tasmania IV and V - Engine Issues

Mr WINTER question to MINISTER for TRANSPORT, Mr ABETZ

[10.40 a.m.]
You have called our new ships defective this morning. Are you saying that if not for the weather, you would have taken possession of the ship Spirit IV and commenced a journey to Tasmania with a defective ship? For the third time this morning, was there an emergency shutdown on either of our two new ships?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I do not know how often I have to repeat to the Leader of the Opposition that we have taken possession of Spirit IV.

Mr Winter - I am well aware of that.

Mr ABETZ - Not of Spirit V.

Mr Winter - We are all aware.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ABETZ - On Spirit V, a defect was found, and given the nature of that defect, the shipbuilder deemed it appropriate to have a look at Spirit IV to ascertain whether that defect, that problem, was also present on Spirit IV.

With any vehicle, if we reduce it to that which most of us can identify with -

Mr Winter - Any vehicle? It is a half-a-billion-dollar ship. It is not any vehicle.

Mr ABETZ - A vehicle purchase. If there is a slight difficulty with a carburettor, for example, you fix it. You do not then label the car as being completely defective.

Ms Finlay - Yes, even after it is in your own possession.

Mr Winter - You said it was defective.

The SPEAKER - The member for Bass will cease her interjections. Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ABETZ - What you say is, 'There was a defect', just as much as with a car with a problem with the carburettor - you fix it. It does not mean that the car is defective per se. What it means is that there was a defect that can be fixed, and the shipbuilders are confident that that can occur. As a result, that will occur.

Ms Finlay - What is the life of the warranty over the ships? How long is it in play?

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass.

Mr ABETZ - Why the Leader of the Opposition seeks to come in here as some marine engineering expert, I have no idea. I suspect he has as much knowledge in this area as I do and that is why I suspect that he should do what I am doing -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left will stop this now.

Mr ABETZ - That is listen to the engineers. Listen to the people who actually know what needs to be done, and then when the ships sail to Tasmania, and we hope that can be as soon as possible, it will be done safely for the crew and for the ship. That is why in these commercial negotiations one has a warranty period built in, because it is anticipated from real-life experience that when you build something new - we have it with houses as well, a warranty defect period, where a good house might have a problem with a doorframe, you fix it.

It does not mean that the whole house is defective and needs to be condemned. All it means is that there was a little defect that can be fixed, and it becomes fit for purpose. That is exactly what the management of the TT-Line are doing. I have every confidence that they will, in conjunction with the shipbuilder, ensure that when the Spirits arrive, they will have had appropriate sea trials, and they will be fit for purpose.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - For the fourth time this morning for the minister; was there an emergency shutdown on either of our two new Spirits?

The SPEAKER - It was the original question, minister. I will draw you to that.

Mr ABETZ - Speaker, as I understand it, no, there was no emergency shutdown. If that is not the case, I will come back to the parliament. TT-Line have advised that there has been no such emergency shutdown, and one wonders why that is being peddled in Question Time in parliament, and then he calls the ship 'defective' and so the list goes on. Why do you continually talk down this transformational infrastructure -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ABETZ - project which will be of great benefit to the producers and the tourism sector? These ships will have a capacity for 40 per cent growth -

Ms Finlay - If they ever arrive.

The SPEAKER - The member for Bass is warned.

Mr ABETZ - That means they are built for future growth. It does not mean that there will be an immediate 40 per cent uptake in the usage of the vessels. It means there is sufficient capacity for growth.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired.


'Adult Crime, Adult Time' Policies

Mr JENNER question to MINISTER for POLICE, FIRE and EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Mr ELLIS

[10.45 a.m.]
After being on a youth court for over 20 years I have put down every sort of punishment handed down to youth court system, from reparation orders to custody. In my experience, I have found the harsher penalties in most cases were not the answer. To your 'adult crime for adult time', my question is: in light of the commission of inquiry's findings calling for trauma-informed responses to vulnerable children, how can your government justify moving towards a harsher penalty for younger people when experts like Professor Robert White have warned that the approach risks setting up future adult prisoners, with which I concur? How, when these experts have warned that the harsher the penalties against these, particularly young people and children, the more likely those young people will go on to become career criminals?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. First, I pay tribute to our amazing frontline police officers who are out there protecting our communities each and every day. We have seen disturbing incidents occurring in some communities around our state, particularly violent crimes committed by quite young people. 

Indeed, we see in this state, broadly speaking, two categories of youth offenders. There are young people who find themselves on the wrong side of the law for the first or second time for relatively minor offences, and it is so important that we take action to help those young people get back on track. I would much rather a young person is in an apprenticeship than Ashley, and those are the kind of investments that we are making through skills, through jobs, through mental health and housing, and a whole range of other areas.

We are also looking very closely at future and increased diversionary options as well. However, there is a group of young people who are committing a very large percentage of youth crime in this state. Fifty-seven young people in the last calendar year committed 50 per cent of all youth crime in this state. There are 30 young people in that calendar year who are charged with more than 50 offences each, and some of them were arrested more than 20 times. Some of the charges that have been laid against young people are for very significant violent crimes. That includes murder.

We need to have a clear-eyed response to these matters. It is important that we work through this situation. We cannot let Tasmania wind up like other jurisdictions in this country, particularly Queensland and Victoria, that have seen a more than 100 per cent increase in youth crime. The Northern Territory has seen virtually a complete breakdown of law and order in some of their communities.

That is why the Premier has said that all options are on the table when it comes to addressing youth crime. It is important that we deliver on the Youth Crime Blueprint that really charts the path for a more therapeutic approach and will significantly help to get those young people who find themselves on the wrong side of the law early on in their journey to get back on the right path.

Incredible investments in people like JCP Youth are transforming the lives of young people who find themselves on the wrong track, but we need to be clear-eyed about the challenges ahead. That is why the Premier said everything is on the table. That includes, of course, adult crime, adult time, and things like bail and sentencing, other options too around diversion. We are working through those opportunities as a government and we appreciate the support from community members; we have seen an outpouring of support for us taking these strong actions because one of the worst things that you could do, Mr Jenner, for a young person, is to teach them that there are no consequences for their actions.

We will continue to work diligently around this approach so that we can keep the community safe and help young people.

Supplementary Question

Mr JENNER - I have a supplementary question, Speaker.

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question from the member of the JLN.

Mr JENNER - Yes, slightly condescending there, but I am quite aware of persistent young offenders, minister. Adult time for adult crime - part of the question comes from that. Where do you hope to incarcerate these young children? All our youth offender facilities are full. I hope you are not thinking of adult prisons.

The SPEAKER - It arises from the original answer given by the minister, so I will draw him to it.

Mr ELLIS - Obviously, we have seen some emerging results in Queensland in terms of adult crime, adult time. We have actually seen a 32 per cent reduction in some of those offences in Queensland. Because things have got so far out of hand, there is still much work to do in Queensland, but it has made a discernible difference in terms of protecting the community and keeping the community safe.

Our government's focused on significant investments so that we can build a new youth justice facility. This is so that we can help young people get back on track. There are a very small number -

Mr JENNER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. We are talking about now, not two years away.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left will stop being helpful. I will draw you to the original question.

Mr ELLIS - There are a very small number of young people who commit the category of offences that would fall into adult crime, adult time, particularly tranche 1 in Queensland, in Tasmania. We are talking a handful of young people, but we also do have a question about where we should put people who have been charged with murder.

The SPEAKER - The member's time for answering the question has expired. 


Macquarie Point Stadium - Enabling Legislation - Ministerial Powers

Mr BAYLEY question to MINISTER for BUSINESS, INDUSTRY and RESOURCES, Mr ABETZ

[10.51 a.m.]
The parliament was told that we would be getting a bill to approve a permit for a stadium. Instead, we have got a bill that approves a half-designed stadium. It grants you unchecked authority to personally amend any permit, and it gives you and your secretary the vast majority of enforcement responsibility. This is a bill to approve the notion of a stadium with power to you to fill in the blanks and to make the changes as you like. Why should MPs and MLCs rubberstamp you appointing yourself as proponent, planning authority and regulator?

ANSWER

Let us completely debunk the nonsense of the Deputy Leader of the Greens. Should I be clothed with any powers? They will not be powers I would be giving myself; they would be the powers bestowed upon me by this parliament. Let us get that absolutely clear.

Mr Bayley - In your own bill.

Dr Woodruff - In your government's bill.

The SPEAKER - Members of the Greens.

Mr ABETZ - This is just one of the many falsehoods peddled by the Greens in their manic opposition to this transformative multipurpose stadium that we want to see as the gateway to our capital city. The stadium will be important for cultural events, sporting events, international conferences; it is something that will be a great economic fillip to our economy, providing well-paid jobs and security for many of our fellow Tasmanians.
Can I debunk this nonsense that somehow, I appoint myself with authority? No, that is wrong. It will be the parliament that will determine what powers, if any, I am given. After that, the legislation requires me to consult in the event of seeking to issue a permit, and that consultation will take place.

The legislation also requires, if I recall correctly, that I need to act in good faith and ultimately, be answerable to this parliament, the Chamber of the people. That is how our democracy works, so do not try to say that somehow, I can magically clothe myself with an authority. That is simply not correct.

What I will be doing, if the parliament gives me certain powers, is seeking to exercise those powers to the very best of my ability, for the benefit of the people of Tasmania, so that they can have this transformative stadium which will be such an important economic fillip, and of course, enable us to have an AFL and an AFLW team in the big league. We can then genuinely be part of the AFL.

Can I say how delighted I was to learn that we now have 210,000 foundation members of our Tassie Devils team, which indicates that, despite all the negativity from the Greens, the membership is still growing. That is what I look forward to: having a stadium on the waterfront. The Deputy Leader of the Greens can continue with his negativity. 

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr BAYLEY - It is clear that the minister thinks that attack is the best form of defence. He acknowledged that the bill gives him some pretty remarkable powers and said that he needs to consult and act in good faith. In fact, I do not think the bill does say anywhere that you need to act in good faith, and the question was - as acknowledged upfront - why should MPs and MLCs rubberstamp you appointing yourself as proponent, planning authority and regulator?

The SPEAKER - The member's time for asking the supplementary has expired. I am not going to allow it. I believe it was answered in the opening statements by the minister.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Federal Government Support

Mrs PENTLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.56 a.m.]
The $240-million funding commitment from the federal government in April 2023 effectively fired the starter's gun on the stadium saga. Since then federal Labor has said very little about the stadium, leaving it to your government to sell the virtues of a deeply unpopular project. Why have you failed to work with the federal government to reduce the risk to Tasmanian taxpayers, and have you engaged with the newly re-elected government in the best interests of Tasmanians?
ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. It has very strong bipartisan support between the federal government and the state government. The Prime Minister sees a significant opportunity for the state of Tasmania and more broadly. That is why the commitment of $240 million was made to support the construction of the stadium and investment in the Macquarie Point precinct.

The Prime Minister also matched our commitment of $65 million for the upgrade of York Park, which we should never lose sight of - that $130 million. Subsequently, GST exemption was also provided for the $240 million, so I am very confident in the commitment made by the Prime Minister and the federal government when it comes to their investment in and their enthusiasm for a Tasmanian AFL and AFLW team.

Despite the Prime Minister's support for the Hawks, I am sure he would have a soft spot for the Tasmania Devils, as we all do. The government is investing in the great affection for Tasmania in many of the 210,000 new members from right across this country and indeed, further afield. I thank the federal government for their commitment and will continue to work closely with the federal government on a range of areas in the best interests of Tasmania.

Supplementary Question

Mrs PENTLAND - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mrs PENTLAND - Obviously the price tag has changed now and the landscape has changed in our economy. Have you engaged with the newly re-elected government in the best interests of Tasmania?

The SPEAKER - The original question talked about engagement with the newly re-elected government. I will draw the Premier to that part of the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We have engaged the new government on a number of matters. We spoke about some of those yesterday, in actual fact, such as the smelter industry across the country, and the situation with Liberty Bell Bay as well. These are very pressing matters. We will continue to engage when it comes to the Macquarie Point Urban Renewal Project and precinct, but there are many other matters on our agenda. We have a lot to work through when it comes to our engagement with the federal government. Notably, health funding and a health agreement that invests more into the Tasmanian health system is well and truly on the agenda, not just for me, but for every state premier irrespective of political colour. The NDIS needs working through as well -

Macquarie Point Stadium - Project Design and Cost

Ms BURNET question to MINISTER for BUSINESS, INDUSTRY and RESOURCES, Mr ABETZ

Yesterday, you admitted the stadium is still only 50 per cent designed. You still have so little idea about the roof, and you are planning to build a test rig at Mac Point to try to figure it out. This is so concerning. The cost of this project has already blown out by $230 million and there are still many unanswered questions and obvious problems.

Despite what you say, minister, rather than addressing these issues, your bill instead decides the best approach is for you to be personally responsible for the lot. It must make you giddy with all that power. You would be able to make whatever changes you want to the stadium and the permit and it would be down to you to make sure it comes in on budget. Do you not see how disrespectful it is to ask the parliament to approve a project that is quite literally half-baked? Given there is so much design work left, can you categorically rule out any further costs? 

The SPEAKER - The member's time for asking the question has expired.

ANSWER

Speaker, when you are manically opposed to something, you will find any reason to oppose whatever the proposition is. We know the Greens are opposed to the stadium, and I recall that the forum with the ABC - I rhetorically asked the audience whether -

Dr Woodruff - At least we know what our position is.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Mr ABETZ - if the roof height was 40 metres, would there be any opposition? 

Ms BURNET - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance.

The SPEAKER - The minister's been on his feet for less than 30 seconds before you took the point of order. The minister will come to the question.

Mr Bayley - Fair prediction.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader, thank you.

Mr ABETZ - When somebody is intractably opposed to something, they will find every possible reason to cast doubt on the proposition. We know that no matter what we do as a government, the Greens will be opposed to the stadium. I am sure if we could say we could do it free of charge, it would only be 5 metres high, they would still be opposed to it. We are having this hypothetical debate from the Greens as to 'What about? What about?'

One thing I will say to the Greens is that those sorts of questions, in fairness, do help us as a government to sharpen, to ensure that we get absolutely everything right in relation to the stadium. Might I say, we will not be fooled into thinking that they are genuine questions because they are not, because we know no matter what the answer the Greens will be opposed.

The SPEAKER - I will draw the minister to the question.

Mr ABETZ - I was asked about many things, including a potential test rig.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Stop. There was a large preamble to the question which covered the test rig. The actual question was whether or not the plan was disrespectful to parliament. Minister can address that. It was the actual question or he can choose to comment on the very long preamble. 

Mr ABETZ - That is what I am seeking to do, Speaker. The test rig is designed to ensure that we can make the stadium as compatible as possible with Cricket Australia. There is meaningful engagement with Cricket Australia as we speak. If you were genuinely interested in seeing cricket being played at the stadium, would you not be welcoming the test rig?

Members interjecting.

Mr ABETZ - Then there is this silly laughter -

Dr Woodruff - You have not designed it.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Mr ABETZ - As is always the case when you hit the bullseye with them, there is this affected laughter because they have no answer. The cost blowout that is referred to is not a cost blowout. 

Members interjecting

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question.

Ms BURNET - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Ms BURNET - The minister talked about wanting to get everything absolutely right. Would that not that be better left to experts to do that?

The SPEAKER - I will call the minister to the question, although I note that it is broad.

Mr ABETZ - Very broad, but guess what? For once, I have found some common ground with the Greens. Of course, it makes good sense to rely on experts and to be advised by them. That is why the test rig that you seem to laugh at is being suggested as a way forward. We have quantity surveys, architectural firms, engineers -

Dr Woodruff - Is this all going to happen before the vote?

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Mr ABETZ - Just last Saturday, a constituent reached out to me who has vast experience in developing turf for stadiums and has a great record at Gosford. We are getting information in from wherever we can, from experts wherever we can, to make sure that this - 

The SPEAKER - The minister will resume his seat. If people are not interested in the answer, I will call on the next question. 


TT-Line - Financial Position

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.05 a.m.]
You have completely broken Tasmania's budget and given up trying to fix it. One reason is your inability to manage major projects, most notably with the ferries fiasco. The level of debt TT-Line is taking on as result of this monumental stuff-up has led them to breach their loan conditions and triggered a prolonged review of their finances by the Tasmanian Public Finance Corporation (TASCORP).

The latest debacle we have uncovered, or heard about this morning, just makes things worse. Will there be a bailout for TT-Line in the upcoming budget? Will you commit to releasing the advice from TT-Line in relation to the defective new ships?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, member for Clark. The Premier is the only person who has been asked to answer the question. 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. First, honourable member, can I say to you: why do you continually come in here and nitpick and play politics and frankly, make things up?

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - Nitpick? TT-Line is borderline insolvent.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left, including the Deputy Leader.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The accusations that you made today - this statement on behalf of TT-Line with reference to recent questions posed to the Tasmanian parliament. TT-Line advised that there has been no emergency shutdown on either vessel. You come in here and you make things up. You cannot be trusted -

Mr Winter - I asked the question. Point of Order, Speaker, Standing Order 2. I never alleged that. I asked a straightforward question four times.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my right.

Mr WINTER - I am more than entitled to ask questions. The answer was no; I am perfectly happy with that.

The SPEAKER - Standing Order 2 does require that all contributions in this House be truthful to the best of everyone's knowledge. I will draw the Premier to the question that he has been asked, now. We have almost got through Question Time. Let us try and get there with everybody remaining in the room. The Premier will address the answer through the Chair.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You come in here, you have already posted on the 'Spirit of Tasmania Enthusiasts' Facebook page, nitpicking and talking the project and Tasmanians down. Perhaps you will post the fact that you got it wrong today in Question Time once again and be upfront and honest.

Mr Winter - Which bit?

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - A failure of leadership. It is abuse of parliament, frankly, honourable Speaker.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order. Member for Clark.

Mr ROCKLIFF - He has form, of course.

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance.

The SPEAKER - I will take relevance. The question was about the current advice and a bailout. I will draw the Premier to that question.

Mr WINTER - Do you need to hear the reason why?

The SPEAKER - No. You only have to tell me relevance. I do actually write down your questions. It is annoying to have to do that. It is annoying to have to write down the answers, but that is the way we are doing it now. The Premier has the call, and I will draw him to the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, Speaker. Mr Willie, of course, is missing his mate who has skipped this week's parliament. The budget week of parliament. Merrily, merrily down the stream.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Premier, as entertaining as it is, I will draw you to the question, please.

Mr ROCKLIFF - One wonders when it comes to the enthusiasm of the member of parliament - should we be calling him 'Shane Bored' when it comes to parliament, in actual fact, Leader?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Premier, I will draw you to the question. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - You are missing your mate. That is why you are doing all your point of orders.

The SPEAKER - Premier, I will draw you to the question. Otherwise, you are in defiance of a ruling of mine. Thank you.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you. The member comes in here, talks projects down, and makes things up.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr Winter - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - The question, again: will there be a bailout for TT-Line in the upcoming budget? Second, will you commit to releasing the advice from TT-Line in relation to the defective new ships?

Mr Abetz - Defective new ships?

The SPEAKER - I will draw the Premier to the original questions. The Premier can refer it to you if you would like, Minister for Transport, but he has not done that. The Premier has the call.

Mr Abetz - He is more than capable, Speaker.

The SPEAKER - I am sure he is heartened to hear that.

Ms Brown - I have not seen that.

Members interjecting.
The SPEAKER - The Premier has the call and the Member for Franklin will cease her interjections.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Our new Spirits will be a game changer for Tasmania, and that is exactly why we initiated this project.

I understand TASCORP will undertake a review of the forecasts and provide advice to the Treasurer as to whether TT-Line can undertake further borrowings in either an unsupported or supported manner. That is the answer to your question. Once TT-Line has the outcome of that review, TT-Line will determine whether it needs equity support from the Tasmanian government and if so, we will have those discussions with Treasury.

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The second part of this supplementary was -

The SPEAKER - I am sorry, the Premier has concluded his answer. I cannot make him do one once he has resumed his seat.


Metro Tasmania - Bus Driver Retention

Mrs BESWICK question to MINISTER for TRANSPORT, Mr ABETZ

[11.11 a.m.]
According to the Rail, Tram and Bus Union (RTBU), Metro's real problem is not recruitment, it is retention. Drivers are walking away claiming conditions are poor and support is lacking. At the same time, Metro is pushing flashy advertisements promising up to $94,000 in earnings and a $2000 sign-on bonus. The union says these figures are misleading and not what current drivers are taking home. Why are you spending money on deceptive advertising instead of supporting your existing workforce.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question and her interest in the bus drivers, in particular for Metro. As I have indicated to the Chamber previously, there is a 25,000-shortage of drivers around the country, and Tasmania is not immune from that shortage.

In recent times Metro, the RTBU and the workers have negotiated a new enterprise bargaining agreement and they have voted on that and accepted it. Part and parcel of that will see a wage increase for various classifications. For Metro to assert and argue in the advertisements that you can earn a particular sum of money, I think it is up to $94,000, is, when you take into account the various classifications - and the top classification, if I recall correctly, for bus drivers is a classification 6, and under the new EBA over a number of years you can achieve that as a potential. Just because you say 'up to' does not mean that everybody is going to earn that.

What I can say to you, and I do not mind saying this to you, is that the private bus sector is a bit concerned about the wage rates for Metro bus drivers, because they are saying they will find it hard to match. When we are talking about the rates for bus drivers, Metro is in front now with a new EBA, be that wrong, right, or indifferent, but that is the simple fact. As a result, I have confidence that what Metro is saying is correct in all the circumstances. Yes, you can get up to - with this new enterprise bargaining agreement, if you serve the appropriate period of time, have the experience, et cetera, you can get up to that. That of course includes, from time to time, as I understand, doing a bit of overtime. That is, in general terms, what Metro is advertising in seeking to get more drivers to overcome the driver shortage which we as a community are experiencing.

Ms Brown - Retention is the problem, because you treat them terribly.

Ms Burnet - What about retention?

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark. Member for Franklin.

Mr ABETZ - I would say to the member: thank you for your interest in Metro and Metro drivers, and the RTBU. The workers agree to the enterprise agreement. As I understand it, it has now been ratified by the Fair Work Commission. It is in place, and that is why Metro is now advertising the new conditions that are available for Metro drivers.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired.


TT-Line - Financial Position

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.14 a.m.]
Tasmania is on the cusp of a credit rating downgrade because you have racked up so much debt. It is almost unbelievable, but TT-Line's financial position is even worse than yours. At a hearing when minister Abetz announced that the cost for the new berth at Devonport had blown out from $90 million to $493 million, he called it a good news day for Tasmania. TT-Line's financial position is only sustainable until September. Will there be a bailout in tomorrow's budget and will the government try to frame that as a good news day for Tasmania?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. I refer to my previous answer. Tomorrow's budget, as you mentioned, is about building a better Tasmania now and into the future. In actual fact, it is a budget that delivers on what Tasmanians care about. We have already announced the priorities of this budget: continuing to grow the economy and delivering on those essential services. Some $14.5 billion is being invested into health over the next four years.

Mr WILLIE - Point of order, Speaker. My question is about the bailout for TT-Line. Their finances are only sustainable until September. It is a very serious question -

The SPEAKER - If the member is calling for relevance, he does not get to restate the question. The Premier went back to his previous answer that he gave on this issue, so I will draw him to that subject matter.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I refer to my previous answer given to the Leader of the Opposition, who has failed the leadership test once again today by coming in here and making things up. He was not asking questions. They were accusations, and he made things up, once again. You come in here, you go outside, and you do not speak the truth. That is a test of your leadership.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left. Premier, if you wish to make substantive allegations, you may do so by a substantive motion. I will draw you to the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - What I can say very clearly is that we will be investing $10 billion into education in the budget, and about $14.5 billion dollars into our health system at $10 million a day. We are making a $1.7 billion investment into police and community safety, and a half-a-billion-dollar investment into housing. These are the things that Tasmanians truly care about. How do we get into a position -

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The question is about TT-Line.

The SPEAKER - I will draw the Premier to the question. The Premier can always choose to resume his seat, having said that he is referring to another answer.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I reference the previous answer. The member expressed some interest in the budget, which will be delivered tomorrow. It will contrast Mr Winter's plan to cut services and increase taxes.

Members interjecting.

Mr Willie - You want to have record deficits still.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left, including Mr Willie, who I believe does want to be in the House today.

Mr ROCKLIFF - This budget will be about increasing services. Mr Winter has made it very clear -

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The question is specifically about TT-Line. It is a serious question.

The SPEAKER - The member does not get to restate the question. The member will remind herself that she is under a warning as well. I will draw the Premier to the question for the next 14 seconds.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I believe I have answered the question.


Budget Management - Debt Growth

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.18 a.m.]
You have completely given up trying to manage the budget responsibly. In your first budget in 2022, you said there would be an operating surplus this year of $32 million. The following year that was downgraded to a deficit of $148 million. The media update then showed a deterioration to a $291 million deficit. At the election, you said the deficit would be $545 million. Six months later, you revised that downwards further to a $793 million deficit, more than twice as bad as the deficits running in the pandemic. Five months after that, in February, you finally admitted the deficit had risen to $1.3 billion. Who knows what it will be by the end of the financial year. 

This has all happened when revenue has been revised up by $600 million. How could Tasmania possibly trust your budget forecast tomorrow when this is your record?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. When Tasmanians see new schools, upgraded hospitals, new hospitals, upgraded roads and new roads, they understand that this is a government in their corner and a government that is building a better Tasmania now and for the future -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - delivering real cost-of-living relief, record investment in frontline services, as I have said, and a sensible pathway to surplus.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Member for Lyons. Member for Clark.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Your plan is to cut services and tax Tasmanians - higher taxes for Tasmanians.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Member for Lyons. The Premier has the call.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The leader himself has said, 'I have no intention of leading a government that hamstrings our state's future because it will not take the tough choices required to live within our means.' You go to business forums and you talk tough about the -

The SPEAKER - Are you calling for a point of order or just standing?

Ms BUTLER - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. 

The SPEAKER - I will take the relevance and draw the Premier to the question, which was broadly how can we trust the budget on their record, and that gives some scope for the Premier's answer.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It sure does, honourable Speaker, because the member goes to business forums and talks tough about budgets, where his clear plan that he has outlined is a plan to cut services and increase taxes.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We could easily do as you did when you were last in government -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - in cutting services, cutting staff out of hospitals -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - If you do not want to hear the answer, I will sit the Premier down and we can end Question Time. The Premier has the call.

Mr ROCKLIFF - but we will not do it. We will have a sensible pathway to surplus. We will manage the economy -

Members interjecting.

Mr Willie - Mortgage the future.

The SPEAKER - The member for Clark is warned.

Mr ROCKLIFF - grow the economy to allow us to fund those essential services in health, education, and community and public safety. What you have to do, honourable member, is ensure that you front up for once in 11 years and deliver an alternative budget so we know which services you are going to cut.

Members interjecting.

Ms Finlay - The three worst financial outcomes in Tasmania's history were under your leadership.

The SPEAKER - Ms Finlay has a second warning.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You are running around saying you would deliver a surplus more quickly. How are you going to do that? Which services are you going to cut and how many taxes are you going to raise on Tasmanians? That is the question to you.

If you want to have any credibility as an alternative government, you have to front up and demonstrate your plan and your alternative budget. We will deliver a budget tomorrow that will be strong. It will deliver for Tasmanians. It will be building a better Tasmania. It will fund essential services, it will grow the economy, it will support Tasmanians with cost-of-living relief and it will have a sensible pathway to surplus.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. I remind ministers again that if they direct their answers through me, it is not as much fun - I get that - but it will actually make Question Time go a little better. I also remind them that they do not get to ask questions of the opposition unless they formally do so under the Standing Orders.

Time expired.


ANSWER TO QUESTION

Metro Tasmania - Bus Driver Retention

[11.23 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Minister for Business, Industry and Resources) - Honourable Speaker, I seek to clarify an answer for the member for Braddon, Mrs Beswick. I indicated that under the new enterprise agreement there were six levels. That was under the old enterprise agreement. There are now four levels in the new enterprise agreement, and you can achieve that after 36 months of service, regardless of performance. That is when the top rate kicks in.


CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Vape Sales in Tasmanian Pharmacies Figures - Clarification

Ms HADDAD - Honourable Speaker, on indulgence, I wanted to advise the House the constituent question I asked yesterday should have been directed to the Minister for Mental Health and Wellbeing. I incorrectly addressed it to the Minister for Health.

The SPEAKER - I do not think we really have a process for that, but I will take that on board for noting.


Kings Meadows Renal Unit - Redevelopment

Ms ROSOL question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

My constituent, Carolyn Gutteridge, has written to your office multiple times since August last year about the Kings Meadows Renal Unit redevelopment, most recently in a joint letter to you and minister Petrusma in May. While the minister has at least acknowledged her letters, your office has remained silent. Will you commit to meeting with Ms Gutteridge and explain why she has had no reply?

Ms Gutteridge is concerned that essential staff will be housed in a demountable in the emergency evacuation zone beside a dumpster bin reportedly used as a fire pit during the redevelopment process. Do you consider this a suitable environment for healthcare workers? The plans for the proposed site show that your government is proceeding with a redevelopment that will barely meet current renal bed demand. Ms Gutteridge wants to know why you are building a facility that will be outdated upon completion.


Royal Hobart Hospital - New Capital Works

Mr BEHRAKIS question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

I have been contacted by a constituent in Hobart who understands that additional beds were added to the Royal Hobart Hospital emergency department in 2023, but wants to know what other work is being done to rebuild the hospital. Noting your recent announcement regarding funding in the Budget for the stage 2 of the ED development, can you expand with more details on this and also any other capital works happening at the Royal Hobart Hospital? 


Tasmania Police - Overtime Cost of Different Roster Models

Ms BUTLER question to MINISTER for POLICE, FIRE and EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Mr ELLIS

A police officer constituent of mine would like to know the total overtime cost associated with continuation of duty under the Ottawa roster compared to the overtime required to sustain your government's six by six and four by four wellbeing trial rosters. Specifically, what is the difference in cost and how is this being factored into your government's decision-making on long-term roster implementation? 


St Helens District Hospital - Site Future

Mr JENNER question to MINISTER for HOUSING, PLANNING and CONSUMER AFFAIRS, Mr ELLIS

My constituent Darryl heard Homes Tasmania is planning to demolish the old St Helens District Hospital instead of developing it. This raises questions about why the funds are not being put towards affordable housing by selling it, rather than giving it away to Break O'Day Council. Can you please clarify if Darryl's information is accurate and advise exactly what is going to happen with the old St Helens District Hospital site?


Southern Lyons Urban Growth Infrastructure Investment

Mr SHELTON question to MINISTER for HOUSING, PLANNING and CONSUMER AFFAIRS, Mr ELLIS

When I visit the many councils within Lyons, a question that is always asked is about the expansion of urban growth boundaries. Southern Lyons has seen significant investment in transport and social infrastructure like the Bridgewater bridge, Tasman Highway, and Brighton and Sorell schools. Can the minister please outline how an expanded urban growth boundary in these areas will leverage these investments and support increased housing supply and affordability for the local communities?

The SPEAKER - I will ask members to at least make it sound as though an individual constituent raised a question.

Waste and Resource Recovery Board 2024 -High Priority Infrastructure Grants

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

A constituent of mine would like to know if the Premier can please provide a list of grants provided through the Waste and Resource Recovery Board's 2024 High Priority Infrastructure Grant program, including the amount provided to each recipient?

[11.30 a.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker. I am pleased to stand and speak on this as acting opposition leader of House business, or however you say it. Estimates is a really important parliamentary process. Quite often we do not get the opportunity in here, as we have witnessed this morning, to glean good answers from the government. Therefore, I want to put on the record our support for this process and the fact that we are very much looking forward to it.

I also want to put on the record our thanks to the government for negotiating on some increase to hours; in particular, the fact that you gave us nine additional hours of scrutiny, which is absolutely fantastic. However, what this tells me is that this government has given up, that they do not have much fight left in them if they will roll over and give you nine hours of extra scrutiny. It is fantastic, and we will take it - 
Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my right.

Ms DOW - and we will certainly make the most of it.

We will not be formally moving any amendments to this motion today. However, what I want to put on notice with the Leader of Government Business is that our Deputy Chairs will be speaking to the Chairs of each respective committee, talking about the sequencing of questions and the frequency of questions. We would like to see for some of the longer time slots an increase in the allocation of questions in each rotation to opposition members and other members of the committees. We think that will assist with flow and the continuation of debate and questioning across the table. 

Mr Abetz - But if we agree, you will say we have given up.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the House.

Ms DOW - The second point we will be raising through our Deputy Chair positions -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, members on my right.

Ms DOW - is that for those allocated Estimates hearings of 30 minutes, that there not be any questions from the government. Thirty minutes is a short time. Those portfolio areas are very important and we should be given the opportunity to ask a reasonable number of questions of the government in that committee setting. We do not want to see time wasted by Dorothy Dixers from the government.

[11.33 a.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my right, I do need to hear. 

Mr BAYLEY - I rise to make my contribution to this motion and support it. We thank all members for their contribution in negotiating it. I will not engage in the criticism of the government in terms of it rolling over and increasing the hours. We welcome the fact there are additional hours and we pushed very hard for those hours. Our criticisms would sit with the government for thinking it could get away with 61 hours in the first place, and the fact we had to push to get that additional time.

The government is obviously responsible for the sitting schedule and when the Budget is to be delivered, and scheduling Estimates in a public holiday period. It is not on us, therefore, to take a cut to the level of time available for scrutiny simply because of that public holiday. It is no excuse to reduce scrutiny.
We thank the government for at least matching the kind of time we had last year - it was really good. We acknowledge there are some 8.00 a.m. starts for some ministers and members who will be scrutinising. 

We also acknowledge the parliamentary staff who will be assisting in that process, and that this is an early commencement. However, that is the way it needs be. Scrutiny is important, so we needed to get that time in. We are happy where this landed. We are happy particularly with the extra time in terms of Business, Industry and Resources, and in terms of the Environment. We hope that we do not have to spend too much of our time interrogating government ministers and their agencies and officials on the stadium and we are looking to prosecute another avenue to have some of those conversations.

There is a lot to deal with in this time. The health crisis, obviously, so we have an extra hour when it comes to Health, and an extra hour with both the Premier and the Treasurer is really important. We do note that Dorothy Dixers are still in there. We are frustrated. We did try to get them out last year, but we have acknowledged that we did not have Labor's support in that at that time and we are not trying to amend it or negotiate it out in this context this time round, but it is disappointing; it is good we have got rid of Dorothy Dixers in Question Time in the House, but it would be good to abandon them in the Committee process as well.

With that, I say thank you again to everyone involved in negotiating this through. It is certainly a very important process. We are looking forward to the scrutiny week and I thank everyone for their involvement.

The SPEAKER - There being no further contributions, I will call the minister and just clarify for the students who have joined us again that we are both happy and unhappy with the motion.

[11.36 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, to sum up, I must say that on her first outing as manager of opposition business I was very disappointed to learn that Ms Dow thinks I am a bit of a soft touch and that we rolled over too easily. I will keep that in mind for next time, but we are in a situation where this parliament has to be collaborative and cooperative and work together, and I thank my staff, opposition staff, Greens staff and those who have collaborated to ensure that we have come for this landing, which, might I add, includes agreeing to change things for two particular ministers who had a ministerial council meeting to attend on the Friday.

That is the sort of collaboration and cooperation that makes the task of myself as leader of the government in this place so much easier. I thank everybody for their cooperation and the landing that we have come to, and I commend the motion to the House.

Motion agreed to.


MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Marine Environment

[11.37 a.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the House take note of the following matter: marine environment.

It is with deep concern that we are watching what appears to be a tipping to collapse in the marine environment, at least in South Australia, and very strong warning signals of something similar happening here in Tasmania. It is on the back, as of the current circumstances - a paralytic shellfish poisoning event that is now unfolding moving from Boomer Bay all the way down to, the latest information we have today, is the western side of Bruny Island, which means the D'Entrecasteaux Channel area and all the people who live in those areas.

It is on the back of jellyfish, salp and algal tides that we have seen in the south-east of Tasmania over the summer period, following millions of dead salmon that were killed by a bacteria that was formerly exotic to the area but is now endemic. It is an unprecedented mass salmon mortality event and the amount of antibiotics that have been put into the water along with the nutrients, the pollution from salmon farming has made a dramatic impact on the health of the southern Tasmanian waters.

We know that the warning was first made on 8 May of paralytic shellfish poisoning at Boomer Bay. There was only a Facebook post from the Department of Health with a link to their website to make such a serious announcement. They shut down the commercial shellfish industry in the area. The next instance that we heard about this potentially deadly health risk was from the Chief Veterinary Officer, Mr de Witte, when he was interviewed about pilchard deaths that also occurred in a very unusual and unprecedented fashion observed in Sandy Bay. The Environment Protection Authority (EPA) had said that they considered that these pilchard deaths were the result of Pilchard orthomyxovirus (POMV), a virus, but the Chief Veterinary Officer said that it was more likely in his opinion that they were the result of a toxic algal bloom.

We know that paralytic shellfish poisoning has now widened to the Mercury Passage from Boomer Bay to the east and the west sides of Bruny. What we have seen in South Australia is incredibly concerning in what it tells us could be happening or is on the verge of happening in Tasmania. More than 200 different species of marine life have been killed in South Australia since toxic algal bloom Karenia mikimotoi began in March. It has been described as a marine horror movie. The ongoing impacts to human health from the toxic algae there include flu-like symptoms, coughing and vision problems.

There has been a targeted response for community organisations, citizen scientists, Ausfish and First Nations groups to document the impacts of the toxin, including the extent, the number and the type of species that have been killed so far. South Australian Health has stepped in and provided advice and resources to GPs to help patients suffering from illnesses from the algal bloom. There has been state and national media attention in South Australia, community forums and events to educate the public on the algae and to help the community recover from this event. There is a lot more that needs to happen in South Australia, but this should be a warning to the South Australian government to direct funds into research and the on-ground efforts to research and restore South Australia's marine environment from this deadly disaster.

Contrast this to the response that we just heard this morning from the Minister for the Environment. We do not know if it is the same toxic algal bloom as is happening in South Australia, but the point is we do not know, because none of these questions are being asked. It is pretty clear from the minister's comments this morning that there is a reason why this minister does not get asked questions about the environment. Firstly, because she is barely capable of undertaking the minimum tasks that are required of her. Secondly, she always flicks the questions to other ministers saying, 'It is not my responsibility, it is the marine environment.' This minister is responsible for coordinating -

Ms OGILVIE - Point of order, Speaker.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Sorry, Leader of the Greens, there is a point of order.

Dr WOODRUFF - What is the point of order?

DEPUTY SPEAKER - We have not heard it yet.

Ms OGILVIE - That is completely untrue.

Dr WOODRUFF - That is not a point of order.

Ms Ogilvie - You do not ask me questions. I do not flick them, because you do not ask the questions. I have had two questions from you. Ridiculous.

Dr WOODRUFF - This minister is responsible for three government agencies and coordinating their response of health, environment and biosecurity. What she is doing is nothing. Rather than providing support for the community who are reeling from seeing their beaches covered with the remains of dead salmon and sardines, who have been looking out from their fishing boats into waters, we have nothing. This is a serious crisis, a serious risk to human health in the marine environment. It is like getting blood out of a stone from this minister about the salmon disaster.

Time expired.

Dr Woodruff - The community wants answers. They demand action.

[11.43 a.m.]
Ms OGILVIE (Clark - Minister for the Environment) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, in true Greens form, they cannot help but depart from the science immediately into personal invective, because that is all they have. It is just completely ridiculous.

Let us get some facts on the table. I rise to speak today on this motion before the House, which we will not be supporting because of the nonsense that is particularly in the back half of it, but I will refer to that as I go through.

Dr Woodruff - You will not support the marine environment? Interesting.
DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order, Dr Woodruff.

Ms OGILVIE - We are reaffirming our unwavering commitment to the protection, sustainability and management of our precious marine environment. Let me first acknowledge the environmental challenges marine ecosystems are facing. The events outlined in the motion are of great concern to all of us in the beautiful state of Tasmania, all of whom care about the environment. In saying this, we must base our positions on the science and on fact rather than emotional endeavours and attacks on individuals.

These are not isolated incidents. Rather, they are part of a broader pattern of environmental stress, driven in part by our complex global marine environment and conditions, with warming waters, which we know are affecting Tasmania more than the global average. We are subject to those global conditions. Let me be clear: we are not standing still. We are acting decisively and responsibly.

I will also remind the Chamber that now we are still, I think, on only two questions from the Greens on Environment in the time I have been -

Dr Woodruff - Yes, you have flicked all the other ones to other ministers to answer because you said you are so incapable of knowing what your business is. You cannot even do your job as the minister. Why would we ask you a question about the environment?

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff, order.

Ms OGILVIE - That is absolutely untrue to say that I have been referring questions, and Hansard will give us the answers on that. We have already strengthened the Environment Protection Authority (EPA). In December of 2021, the EPA was established as a standalone state authority under the State Service Management Act. It operates independently from government with a clear mandate to conduct environmental assessments and approvals without direction from any party, including without direction from me. I have said that many times in this Chamber.

Dr Woodruff - You are meant to be coordinating the environment, the health and biosecurity. You told us that in a briefing but you are not doing it.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order, Dr Woodruff.

Ms OGILVIE - The suggestion that the EPA is somehow beholden to government direction is simply false. It undermines the integrity of our public servants who are very important, highly trained scientists who you say you like and want to listen to the science, so let me help you with that. 

Dr Woodruff - I am listening to the Chief Veterinary Officer, and he is very concerned.

Ms OGILVIE - They are environmental experts who work tirelessly to protect our environment, our shared environment. I take this opportunity to thank those staff for their dedication, for their professionalism and for what they have been doing recently, in particular. Now, in 2024-25 -

Dr Woodruff - That is right, they do a great job - without any leadership from you.
DEPUTY SPEAKER - Sorry, minister, one second. Stop the clock for a moment. The House will come to order. The minister will be heard in silence. I am sure there are going to be other Greens speakers on this. The minister will be heard in silence and then you will be heard in silence. The House will come to order without interjections.

Ms OGILVIE - Thank you very much.

The 2024-25 Budget allocated $8.5 million to the EPA, which is an increase from previous years, to support expanding staffing and environmental assessment, science and technical areas. This investment ensures the EPA can meet the growing demand for rigorous environmental oversight, particularly as Tasmania continues to attract major renewable energy and infrastructure projects.

The EPA is also playing a critical role in regulating our marine environment. Following the recent salmon mortality event, the EPA has implemented strong environmental licence conditions under our marine fish farming standards. These include mandatory monthly reporting of fish mortalities, with all regions now reporting as of May.

In February alone, approximately 6,300 tonnes of mortalities were reported, but importantly, 100 per cent of this material was beneficially reused through composting, land spreading or other approved methods.

Dr Woodruff - What about all the stuff that washed up on beaches?

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff.

Ms OGILVIE - This is a testament to the effectiveness of our regulatory framework and the cooperation of industry and local councils, with people working together. 

We are also seeing a decline in mortality waste. In March, waste volumes dropped by 46 per cent compared to February and it was all beneficially reused. These are real, measurable outcomes that demonstrate the EPA's strong regulatory powers in action. We are not blind to the challenges; we know that a properly regulated agriculture sector is conducive to mitigating environmental risks. That is why we continue to refine standards, strengthen compliance and invest in science-based solutions.

Dr Woodruff - Are you concerned about the western side of Bruny having paralytic shellfish poisoning?

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff, order.

Ms OGILVIE - It is science and facts that we are dealing with, not just a consideration of some sort of gut feel or some other sort of concern or catastrophising that you tend to come up with. Let us not fall into the trap of politicising science. We do not want to undermine the very institutions that are doing the work we need them to do.

[11.48 a.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Ecological disaster, minister. That is what it has been called and what is happening in South Australia, because our oceans are dying. That is not some flippant, emotional response. That is what the science is telling us and they are the facts. Our oceans are warming because of human-induced climate change. That is a fact and that is from the science, and what are you doing as Environment minister to protect our marine environments or to even act on climate change? What we are seeing happening in South Australia is that our environment is sick and people are becoming sick as well. Humans are at risk when our environment is that sick.

I am not convinced from the minister's response in Question Time this morning. To stand here and say that she will not be accepting and noting the marine environment in this House - as Environment minister? That is fundamentally dismissing your job. How can you be taking this seriously? You are not, at all, and you have just demonstrated that completely.

Ecological disaster is what it has been called. The South Australian algal bloom, the deaths and destruction that followed - that is impacting human health. There were surfers and swimmers and people who visited that beach who became sick. The first impacts of that toxic bloom were evident back in March, and there are now thousands of square kilometres that are being impacted. That is also having flow-on effects to the tourism industry and the fishing industry, and that is similar to what we are going to see here, but we -

Ms Ogilvie - It is regulated.

Ms BADGER - You are not, what are you doing?

Members interjecting.

Ms BADGER - Algal blooms are not regulated, minister. We cannot control when an algal bloom happens. Are we also going to regulate to what degree our ocean is warming? This shows the absolute lack of knowledge and understanding and seriousness of this issue from this minister, and it is absolutely appalling. Our planet is dying, and the Environment minister says it is regulated. Absolutely appalling. Shame on you, minister. Absolutely shameful.

Ms Ogilvie - Triggered. Stop pointing your finger at me. Stop shouting.

Ms BADGER - In Tasmania, the toxic algal blooms are a result of the elevated nutrient levels in our waterways. What is being done to monitor all of those? What is this minister actually doing? The algal bloom - Dr Woodruff, member for Franklin, has touched on this. It was detected in Mercury Passage and Boomer Bay to begin with, Okehampton Bay, adjacent to a salmon farm in Mercury Passage. Is that a coincidence? What science has been done over here, minister? 

The paralytic shellfish toxin is from contamination of shellfish by the algal blooms. The poisoning that can come from that is incredibly serious. There is an incredibly serious human health risk associated with it. Some of the symptoms include numbness, tingling of the face as well as gastrointestinal issues. In serious cases this can lead to respiratory failure and death.

Facts, minister. This outbreak is shutting down local and recreational commercial shellfishing. Why are we not taking it seriously? It is impacting the environment, and it is impacting our economy and local jobs, yet we have heard crickets from the Minister for the Environment. What about from health? What about those impacts on Tasmanian people? We have seen what has happened in South Australia -

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order, Ms Badger will be heard in silence from both sides. That includes her own party, members of which can stop interjecting.

Ms BADGER - Thank you, Deputy Chair. It seems inappropriate to read out what the next line was - the silence from this government on this matter is deafening - because you are very loud on nonsense defence. People on the east coast, right across Lutruwita/Tasmania - our oceans are everything to Tasmanians.

There is some ludicrous statistic about the number of Tasmanians who have boats and shacks compared to any other state in Australia -

Ms Ogilvie - What is it? What is the number?

Ms BADGER - Are you now doubting, minister, that lots of Tasmanians think the ocean is important and that we have dinghies and shacks? 

Ms Ogilvie - No, I am asking if you know the number of people who own boats.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order.

Ms BADGER - Why do I not come back to you with it? I will come back to you with it when you come back to us with the science on this.

Ms Ogilvie - That would be great, thanks very much.

Dr Woodruff - You are such a shameful minister.

Ms Ogilvie - A personal attack again?

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order. The House will come to order.

Ms BADGER - The penguins in Bicheno - there was a mass exodus of that colony that coincided with a four-degree offshore warming. That happened in the middle of breeding season, so what are the impacts going to be moving forward? We wrote to the Minister for the Environment, who fobbed us off to the minister for biosecurity - part of your role, I think, Ms Howlett, but I am not sure. We talked about reconvening the Penguin Advisory Board and actually getting the science so that we can find out what the impact is going to be, because what if it happens again next year? What is the impact going to be long-term? This is the most appalling debate from the Minister for the Environment not taking this seriously.

Time expired.

[11.53.a.m]
Ms FINLAY (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, it is my pleasure this morning to elevate conversations in Tasmania about our marine environment. The topic for the matter of public importance this morning is our marine environment. What a wondrous thing it is to grow up on an island, off the bottom of an island, and be surrounded by oceans that are rich in some of the most diverse biological conditions anywhere else. It is a fantastic and a special thing to happen for those people who choose to live in Tasmania, but also for those people who choose to visit.

The marine environment in Tasmania is part of who we are, it is part of how we live, and it is part of how we support our livelihoods. For our children to grow up and to have the opportunity to camp along our coastlines, to enjoy learning to swim, to surf, to dive, and to go out and fish recreationally is a great thing that builds in the personality of someone who grows up in Tasmania. People in Tasmania, using the joy and the abundance of our marine environment, are unique in the world in the way that we approach things and do things because of the abundance in our oceans. We have incredible tourism opportunities generated in Tasmania because of what we can see and engage with and experience with our oceans.

Dr Woodruff - Not in a dead ocean, though.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff.

Ms FINLAY - The incredible Pennicott tours that have established themselves from various iconic points in Tasmania share with not only locals, but international and national visitors, the marine environment and the coastlines that are so unique in this place. To grow up and live here, and develop a family and support a livelihood in Tasmania, we need to be grateful for our oceans and for all of the wondrous things that they offer. 

I had the opportunity many years ago to see an underwater photography exhibition with some of the incredible wildlife and situations that we see all around our coastlines. There are some in this place who seek to focus on negativity -

Dr Woodruff - Are you concerned about what is happening, Ms Finlay?

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff.

Ms FINLAY - but there are many in this place who enjoy the positivity of the marine environment in Tasmania and none more so -

Dr Woodruff - Draw yourself to the environment.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff.

Ms FINLAY - than the people who choose to raise their families and live in our small regional and rural towns and our coastal towns, whether it be a generational fisher - a family who has fished for years in very unique situations where there is pressure on our wild fishing stocks. Tasmania is one of the few places around the world where you can have a local fisher go out and fish in our marine environment, catch a fish and have it be in the local fish shop that day for people in Tasmania to enjoy on their home dinner plates. What we see more and more is the negativity and the pressures around these opportunities, limiting Tasmanians with their unique Tasmanian lifestyle.

I have a family in my electorate of Bass where the father, the grandfather and the son are all fishing for local fish. Commentary that continues from negative elements of our community continues to put pressure on those fishers who are line fishing in Tasmania -

Dr Woodruff - The shellfish industry has been closed down. Are you concerned about that?

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens, order. The Leader of the Greens is warned.

Ms FINLAY - You travel to beautiful places like King Island, Flinders Island and across our northern coasts and there are other fishers in Tasmania being able to support their families off this lifestyle. There is no doubt that there are pressures in our marine environment, there are pressures on our wild stocks, and that is why farming fish is important for us to continue to provide great protein to our communities from Tasmania. It is something that we should be proud of. We need to take the pressure out of our wild fisheries and support those people that choose to live in our regional and rural communities, in our coastal communities, to ensure that there is low carbon protein available not only in Tasmania but across the country and across the world.

We in Tasmania should be proud of the incredible organisations and research institutes that continue to demonstrate what is possible and what is being done in Tasmania, led by Tasmanians. We have the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS), we have the local elements of the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC), we have our Sustainable Marine Research Collaboration Agreement (SMRCA) grants, we have the seafood industry in Tasmania. They are all looking out for the ocean environment and the marine environments in Tasmania.

There is no doubt that Tasmania is in a unique position. We have a wondrous, abundant and cared-for marine environment that always needs protection. One of the things that the Greens often raise concerns about putting pressure on the marine environment is climate change. The greatest solution to climate change is renewable energy, but get this: the Greens do not even support renewable energy, which would impact a lessening of climate change and support our marine environment.

Time expired.

Dr Woodruff - Not true. Garbage, talking rubbish. Misleading and false.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order.

[11.58 a.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, my background is a lived experience on the marine environment. Since I have been fishing, here are a few things depleted: bastard trumpeter, southern calamari, southern garfish, sand flathead, striped trumpeter, blue warrior, and jackass morwong. Fish down: crayfish, banded morwong, and abalone. What I have seen in that time, while all of this has been going on, is the loss of our kelp forest. We had the salps, then the bioluminescence, then the jellyfish, and now fish deaths. This is an environment that is showing all the symptoms of being sick. This is all happening where salmon farms are.

The other thing we have right through our marine environment now is an exotic disease that is now listed as endemic. It is everywhere where the salmon farms are.

Members interjecting.

Mr GARLAND - Will you let me finish?

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order. Members on my left. Mr Garland will be heard in silence.

Mr GARLAND - It is a disease that is right around the state. There are two diseases in Macquarie Harbour that are isolated to that area. At a time when there is no confidence in the management of this salmon industry, they are marching into the north-west, despite the surfing community, the fishing community, the environmentalists, and the whole north-west coast against them coming in. What do they do? Biggest mass mortality event, 'Let us just roll on up there into the next space.' This is absolutely disgraceful.

The opportunities from rebuilding our fish stocks, this is where we need to go. We have got fish down, fish down, fish down. We had a department, when I first started fishing, that occupied the whole second floor of the marine board building. Not long after, they were restricted to a little area down the bottom and I met with the director there and he was beside himself. He ended up resigning because they would not give him the resources, they would not give him the staff to manage our wild fisheries properly, and here we are.

Here we are saying, 'How great is salmon?' It is impacting our environment. To say we need fish and impacting our wild fisheries at the same time to reduce the effectiveness is absurd. The excess nutrients: what people do not realise - 

Ms Finlay interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Ms Finlay.

Mr GARLAND - we are an old continent, we are nutrient poor, you throw excess nutrients into an environment that is not used to having that sort of amount of nutrients, guess what happens? Salps, bioluminescence, jellyfish, fish deaths. There is no escaping that. You do not have to be a rocket scientist to understand that. 

There are 30,000-odd boat-users in this state. There are 100,000 recreational fishers. Our marine environment, our culture - what I have experienced in here is you talk about jobs and growth and economics, and the environment takes a back seat. Our culture is intrinsically entwined with the natural environment. When you attack that, you are attacking us. People do not understand. Talk to the Aboriginal community. They understand it. It is an attack on our culture.

The other thing: there is a big global push now on food security. The biggest thing, the biggest risk going forward is food security, and what are we doing?

Members interjecting.

Mr GARLAND - We are killing off the very thing - all our inshore areas of fish-propagation nursery areas are extremely important. You understand larvae movements and the threat to those larvae - just an oil slick will kill the larvae. That is it. It is a lottery whether that larvae survives from one year to the next without any incursion by us.

It is totally abhorrent what is happening in this state. What has to be acknowledged is how important that marine environment is to our culture, to us to feed. I will give an example: on the north-west coast, the calamari fishery has been shut for two months now. I know poor-income families who could walk across that highway, access that fish and give their families some good, clean protein. Now, because of everyone being allowed to come into it - and, I might add, we have been asking for 15 years to restrict that fishery. All we wanted was it to be restricted and what is the end result? They have taken a three-month fishery that was available to the whole community and turned it into a two-week fishery for the part-timers and rorters who have other jobs to come in and flog it to death for two weeks.

Guess what else has happened? Sydney fish market just acknowledged today - we build a market up there through the quality of our seafood, now we have a two-week fishery where everyone is freezing the product, they do not freeze it fast, you have to freeze it fast, and what is happening now? They cannot sell our calamari in the Sydney fish market after we spent 10 years getting that market, building it up, focusing on the quality because we had to, because we are only catching small amounts, and now we have lost that.

Please, I will beg you: reign this salmon industry in, get those pens out of the north-west, which is what is happening there. We should be doing science on the King George whiting, the kingfish, the snapper, the churner and everything else that is building up in that area, but what are we doing? We are putting a trial and effort to benefit three main corporations in the salmon industry, using $20 million of taxpayers' money to benefit out of it. We get no benefit.

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Ms Finlay. Order, order. Dr Woodruff, order.

Mr GARLAND - Absolutely abhorrent. If ever there was a time when the community is being left behind and the focus is on corporations and their best interests - us.

Ms HOWLETT (Lyons - Minister for Primary Industries and Water) - Deputy Speaker, a strong biosecurity framework is essential for the protection and growth of Tasmania's primary production industries and the community. As we know, aquatic pests and diseases have the potential to destroy marine and freshwater environments and to decimate recreational and commercial fisheries. Tasmania's strong biosecurity framework is designed to manage these risks and present significant economic and social benefits for Tasmania. This enables us to rapidly respond to the detection of endemic, introduced or new and emerging infectious diseases.

I want to draw your attention to the strong biosecurity measures in place for the salmon industry. Salmonid aquaculture has become Tasmania's largest primary industry in the 30 years since its introduction to our state. The industry also supports an extensive range of external businesses and jobs as well as their families. This includes feed businesses, pen and net manufacturing, vessel manufacture, processing, transport and logistics operations as well as food and beverage providers.

As Tasmania's largest seafood sector, salmon aquaculture farming has dedicated policy and planning framework within tailored biosecurity systems which recognises the introduction of or emergence of new infectious diseases in Tasmanian waterways. Yes, industry recognises that biosecurity is a critical business and proactively managing the risk is vital to its future growth and sustainability.

Measures in place include the Salmonid Industry Biosecurity Program and Tasmanian Salmonid Health Surveillance Program. The Salmonid Industry Biosecurity Program is part of Tasmania's new aquaculture standard and has a long history of development with input from the industry. In 2014, a voluntary biosecurity program for the industry was introduced by the Salmonid Growers Association, now Salmon Tasmania.

The introduction of the Biosecurity Act 2019 provided framework legislation with a range of mechanisms designed to support better biosecurity outcomes for industry, community and government. The act created the opportunity to further strengthen the voluntary salmon industry program with strong underpinning government regulation.

The program improves the overall biosecurity of all salmonid production in Tasmania by preventing, eliminating or minimising the risk posed by infectious disease and aquatic pests. The program sets standards designed to reduce biosecurity risk between growing regions, year classes, operations and individual farms. The overall application of the standards contained in the program also provide for improved fish health and welfare outcomes.

I want to talk about the Tasmanian Salmonid Health Surveillance Program, which is an aquatic animal health service that monitors fish health and detects new and emerging diseases. We should be very proud of the work occurring at the Centre for Aquatic Animal Health and Vaccine Prospects which is operated as a program. The centre is a diagnostic and disease research facility and plays a really key role in promoting aquatic animal health and managing animal risk. The centre led the development of the vaccine to improve fish health and enable industry growth.

Biosecurity Tasmania also undertakes surveillance and regulatory activities, risk analysis and planning, provision of support to operators and awareness, communication and engagement programs. Biosecurity Tasmania, in accordance with the Biosecurity Act and Aquaculture Branch, works closely with Biosecurity Tasmania to provide support and advice in identifying managing biosecurity risks.

We know aquatic pests and diseases have the potential to destroy marine and freshwater environments and to decimate recreational and commercial fisheries. I want to reiterate the biosecurity measures that the Tasmanian government has in place to manage these risks. Our biosecurity framework provides significant economic and social benefits for Tasmania, allowing us to rapidly respond to the detection of endemic, introduced or new and emerging infectious diseases.

Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, what an enlightening debate this has been. It has been very disappointing to hear the government's response on this and to hear their dismissive arguments towards us. The Greens have raised a very critically important issue this morning, the marine environment, and that has been battered away and there have been ad hominem arguments where we have been attacked, rather than a mature discussion of what is actually a critical situation for us in Tasmania, and we also know that marine environments are under threat globally.

We have heard a number of people this morning outline how important our marine environment is to us culturally in Tasmania. I wanted to mention some of the cultural events, one particular cultural event happening in Bass soon that is reliant on a healthy marine environment. That is the Bridport Scallop Fiesta, an economically important event and a culturally important event in our state, and just one example of the benefits that a healthy marine environment brings for us. We know that we are not looking at a healthy marine environment at the moment.

Earlier this year, I met with a 94-year-old fisher from Beauty Point and he outlined for me the changes that he has witnessed in his fishing experiences in the Tamar and along the north coast of Tasmania. He described multiple species of fish that are no longer able to be catched. He also described species of fish coming down into this environment that have never been here before but because of the warming waters are now here.

We know that our kelp forests on the east coast of Tasmania are disappearing due to climate change. We know that there are invasive species moving into our waters. We have seen the signs of marine health decline for many, many years. What we have now is an alarm bell ringing. We have been able to ignore it and look away and just keep doing well because we are all enjoying things and enjoying the fish from the ocean, but now we are looking at an absolute crisis.

All the things that we have talked about this morning we are seeing here with the toxic algal bloom that is happening at the moment - this has not happened out of nowhere. This has been developing for some time and the government have been asleep at the wheel. They have allowed this to happen and they have not taken action to protect our waterways. What we are looking at is a crisis.

Despite that, they are wanting to ignore this. They are putting out quiet little warnings, but not taking the action that is needed, not giving this the urgency and the attention that it requires. This is not good enough on the part of the government. We rely on our oceans. We rely on them for health. The health of our whole Earth relies on healthy oceans and we are just dismissing that and flicking it away as if it does not matter. It has to improve.

Time expired.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - The question is that the matter of public importance be noted. Those of that opinion say 'aye', to the contrary 'no'.

Ms Ogilvie - No.

Matter noted.
Dr Woodruff - No?

Ms Ogilvie - We can note it.

Dr Woodruff - That is what normally happens. I have never heard a minister actually vote against noting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order, Dr Woodruff.

Dr Woodruff - I just want to note that as being extraordinary.

Ms Ogilvie - You are extraordinary.

Ms Rosol - She is, I agree.

Mr Bayley - She is indeed.

MOTION

Macquarie Point Stadium - Impacts

[12.13 p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I indicate a vote will be required. I move -

That the House -

Notes that after decades of fighting for an AFL team, Tasmania was finally granted the 19th licence to join the AFL. 

(2)	Acknowledges that the Tasmanian Devils are already generating a significant increase in sporting participation among young people, specifically: -

a 40 per cent increase in the number of children registered for Auskick across the state since the launch of the Tasmanian Football Club in March 2024; and 

(b)	overwhelming growth in Reclink's AFL programs in Tasmanian schools. 

(3)	Further notes that participation in community sport has a positive impact on health, wellbeing and social cohesion. 

(4)	Acknowledges that Tasmania's AFL license is dependent on a multipurpose stadium being built at Macquarie Point, as this venue will underpin the financial viability of the team through game day revenue. 

(5)	Further notes: -

that the proposed Macquarie Point stadium will include a 1500-seat function centre; 

that Business Events Tasmania estimates this venue will enable Tasmania to bid for an additional 110 business events creating $332 million in economic opportunity; and 

that the Tourism Industry Council Tasmania and the Tasmanian Hospitality Association predict the stadium will prompt a second 'Mona effect' in terms of transformational economic impact. 

(6)	Further acknowledges: -

that any major project which presents immense opportunities also presents challenges; and 

that without the multipurpose stadium, Tasmania will lose not only our AFL team, but also the massive economic opportunities across business events, sport and the arts for decades to come. 

This is the first time that I have brought a motion relating to the stadium to this place. I do it at this particular time because of the debate that is occurring in the community and the decision that parliamentarians will be making in the coming weeks based on the proposal for legislation to enable this project to go ahead.

It is crucially important that people acknowledge the underpinning arguments, the facts and the reasons why our parliament is coming to this juncture. That is why this motion is crucially important: to send a message to the community people of the view of the parliament about why we are seeking to have an exemption from planning laws to the point of the enabling legislation.

I have a unique perspective on this, because in 2012 or 2013 I was involved in two very important pieces of work as an economic development minister and an infrastructure minister in government. First of all, I was part of a Cabinet that renegotiated the Hawthorn deal back into Launceston. The Hawthorn Football Club plays a very important role - not so much in football, although there is a benefit - in terms of events in the northern capital, in Launceston. They have done fantastic work there. We were involved in the renegotiation and locking Hawthorn into Launceston for a three- or four-year deal.

I was also tasked by the premier of the day to negotiate with the North Melbourne Football Club and the AFL for extra AFL content in Tasmania, in Hobart and in Bellerive. It became very clear during that negotiation that the AFL was very keen in resolving an issue they had in Melbourne in terms of some of the stadium deals, particularly what North Melbourne had at what is now known as Marvel Stadium. It was made very clear to me at that stage by senior AFL officials that there was zero consideration of Tasmania getting an AFL licence. This was purely a game deal. This was purely about getting games for North Melbourne out of Melbourne and into Hobart. North Melbourne has been a good contributor to the southern economy in terms of their events down here, although even in Melbourne they struggle to attract the crowds that a Tasmanian team would drag, and clearly what the Hawthorn Football Club does in Launceston.

At the same time, I was the minister who negotiated the $50 million with the then federal infrastructure minister, Mr Albanese, to redevelop the railyard site. The context was this: we had a Sullivans Cove precinct plan with Infrastructure Australia in excess of $100 million, because that was the cut-off to seek investment through Infrastructure Australia to re-energise and re-invigorate Sullivans Cove. At that stage we were not able - we were not successful in seeking the full money, in achieving the full money for that investment. However, I was able to have a conversation with the then minister, now Prime Minister Albanese, around $50 million to redevelop Macquarie Point.

At that time, when we succeeded in getting that money for the remediation and the preparation for development of that area, there were a lot of ideas about what we could do there. One of the ideas was for a stadium. The argument being used against our current proposal is, 'Well this is ridiculous, this is just build it and they will come.' Back then, that probably was the proposal. The AFL made it very clear we were not going to get a licence, we were not going to get a team. To build a stadium on spec at the time without a commitment from the AFL would have been irresponsible.

Moving on from government, and the following government, there were a lot of ideas and a lot of suggestions around the Macquarie Point development. Everyone refers to the MONA vision for that site. People still say, 'Well, the current proposal is extinguishing the MONA proposal.' The full MONA proposal would have meant we would have to close the Hobart port because we would have to demolish the working aspects of the port because there was a pier. The MONA proposal in its full sense would have been completely unworkable. A modified MONA was proposed, but that relied on billions of dollars of state and federal money creating the institutions down there which would never be funded, could never be funded.

As we went forward, and when I was re-elected to this place in 2018, the previous premier, Peter Gutwein, who was at that stage planning minister and treasurer, brought in legislation for a mixed-use development. A mixed-use development that could have been put anywhere in the country and that would have become, like Docklands, not the football oval, but the commercial area around that area, which could have been built anywhere and actually did not make the best use of that piece of land. 

When the proposal for the stadium was put forward, it was not on spec, 'build it and they will come'. It came with two things. It came with the delivery of an AFL club for Tasmania, the 19th licence, which was something that we have been campaigning for and desperate for for 30 years. The reason why we were not able to achieve the licence: one, for many years, the AFL were too busy building television revenue out of the eastern states. They were not interested in delivering for a foundation state like Tasmania that has delivered some of the finest AFL talent who have produced some of the finest moments that the game has ever seen. It has taken us so long to get to this point.

Let us not forget the taskforce, the work they did in producing a business case and a presentation of an opportunity for the AFL, which did not detract from their organisation but actually added to their organisation. Within that taskforce was the concept of a new facility, and it was not just an idea; it underpinned the business case for the team. You look at match day revenue, you look at the clubs that raise revenue out of their match day events, they are the ones who absolutely, in a competition like the AFL, are successful because they generate the revenue to make their club successful.

It was not on a whim. It is not an idea that was thought up in Docklands at AFL House. It was a concept that had to be put forward by the Tasmanian community to underpin the financial viability of a club. No one wants an AFL team that has its cap out every year asking for money just to survive. We do not want to just survive; we want to be successful. The other opportunity, obviously, is the concept for conferences and events and I have spoken in this House a number of times about the importance of our convention sector and I will talk about that in a moment.

Both of these things came together, which produced the concept of a stadium and a facility, and people are so unaware of the economic activity that occurs in these kinds of facilities. I have been fortunate enough to visit the Adelaide Oval recently and had an extensive tour and a discussion with the organisation that runs that. The kind of revenue generated for that facility outside of sport is phenomenal and that is something we should look at. It is not just about a team and a convention centre and a stadium in terms of its own purpose, but the concept of sport, in terms of giving young people hope and people a future; it is not just about state pride, the JackJumpers have demonstrated that, but the concept of sport and a team.

We say in Tasmania a lot, 'You cannot be what you cannot see.' It really is about showing people 'This is your pathway.' It is no surprise that there is a range of youth activity around the Hawthorn games in Launceston because they can see the players. You maximise that by having a Tasmanian map on a jumper and something of your own to hold onto. Most of us have our VFL/AFL teams. We have them because we do not have a team of our own and imagine - I am going through an existential crisis, I admit - with Collingwood and Devils - well, I tell you, I am a Tasmanian first. Let us have a look: with the establishment of the club, there has been a 40 per cent increase in the number of children registered for Auskick across the state. That number in Hobart is close to 80 per cent in the southern part of the state, and so it is crucially important that we understand why this has happened. It is about inspiration, it is about hope, it is about a pathway, and that kind of activity.

People know that I am president of the Southern Football League. In terms of that role, what it does, it gives me an insight. AFL football for many years and the game Australian Rules has been struggling; competition from other sports, competition for careers and the change in society, it has been under pressure. We needed a light on the hill, to use a Labor phrase, a light on the hill and that is a football club and that is a team and a pathway for young people.

What has been really interesting has been talking to Reclink, which is an organisation that provides sport and recreation activities for communities facing disadvantage. They do amazing work. These are working-class kids who cannot afford the registrations, cannot afford boots, cannot afford to get access to this opportunity. Off the back of the AFL team they have seen a massive increase in their programs. An additional close to 200 young Tasmanians are getting active.
In the youth football leagues, they have had an increase in team registrations, with Sorell and Kingston joining the inner-city competition and Glenora in the Southern Midlands. As you head to the Highlands, being connected to the district league, there has been a massive uplift in working-class kids. I have seen it. When I played, coming through juniors, I saw coaches, I saw managers, parents reaching out and picking up kids who could not get to sport to make sure they got to sport.

Sometimes the coach is the only positive role model in their life. That kind of story, that kind of reaching out that a young kid - just because of their situation they should not miss out on the opportunity of playing organised sport, building relationships, having positive role models in their life, getting fit, getting access, understanding the concept of team and that we are all in this together - that is a community value. Sport does that.

The inspiration that we have already seen: they have not even run onto the ground yet and the massive uplift has been phenomenal. Early on, there was a lot of criticism of the AFL football, 'It is just men in suits down from Victoria'. Yes, the AFL do wander around in suits like politicians. We wander around in suits. Not all of us, Mr Garland, but most of us do.

However, I will tell you what football is. It is when a family moves to Huonville, and they know no one. They are there, they have got a job down in a regional part of Tasmania, or Smithton or wherever, and their children or they join the local football club or local sporting club. Guess what? They have automatically got a family; they are automatically connected. What it is, it is the mum and dad that register their children in Auskick, and they follow their career through the juniors and through the seniors.

When children move on or they retire from their football, the parents and the grandparents are still there on the gate taking the tickets; they are selling margin tickets to raise money for the club; they are selling savs and beers, and they are part of a community. Sporting clubs - particularly our regional sporting clubs in an AFL state, AFL is a league, an Australian rules state - means something to people. It is connection. It is where people get their first job, sometimes, they get a contact for their first job. I know that is how it worked for me, and my experience is echoed and mirrored by thousands of families across Tasmania.

We know having the inspiration of a football club will be enough to get people up and about, but we have also got to acknowledge - and what people are missing out and saying the AFL are the evil empire and for many years they were, because they did not care about Tasmania. They just wanted to harvest our best youth.

What they are doing now, and when I was standing at North Hobart watching Gillon McLachlan, who I have not been a huge fan of, but I will give him credit for this, he said, 'Tasmania has the 19th licence.' I was fortunate to be there looking around and seeing some of the hard units of Tassie football, not very emotional people, had tears streaming down their faces. What it meant to them.

Look at the investment as well. People are forgetting that the AFL want us to be successful. They have made it very clear. They have committed $360 million over the next decade to build the game and what does that mean? That means grassroots development, it means infrastructure, it means facilities for clubs around the state, umpiring investment, leadership and club support. It is an investment in the game. Not just a football - people, communities across our state.
It is not just the elite game. When you look at the stadium as the underpinning for the revenue - and the club have been very clear about the difference between games where you have a poor facility that does not generate the revenue. It completely undermines their business model and their business case, and the AFL have made it clear that if you do not have a solid business case, regardless of the merits of the history, you cannot be a part of the league. They have already have clubs that are struggling financially, and I do not want to be associated with a team and a club and a league that does not enable us to be successful. That is crucially important for us.

Then, as I have said in previous contributions on the stadium, look at the broader economic impact. In a number of venues, the maximum conference size with seating for food and beverages is about 650 people. They top out at that, at two venues in Tasmania individually. You can get to higher if you use a venue like Princes Wharf, for example, but you have to bump in all your gear, so it is so much more expensive. I think that people need to understand that the 1500 seat capacity will fundamentally change things, and the industry have been very clear that this is hundreds of millions of dollars of economic activity that we are missing out on that the stadium will bring to Tasmania.

It is not just the construction phase that will create a lot of jobs, but also hundreds of jobs will be made and sustained by the operations day to day. Adelaide Oval is operating not just on sporting days; it is virtually six-and-a-half days a week with events and conferences. We are missing out on that. We need to get access to that because it is crucially important.

They have talked about the MONA effect. I was the economic development minister and the minister at the time when MONA opened, and we were having discussions at that time with a whole range of hotel chains. They were saying, 'Geez, not sure about MONA. We will have a look at it; we will see what happens.' As soon as MONA opened, as soon as people saw the visitation, how many high-rise hotels have been built in the Hobart CBD?

It triggered a decades-long construction boom in Hobart. This will do the same. People need to understand the sporting tourism market is massive across the country and across the world, and having it at a location such as Macquarie Point means it will become an iconic visitation point for people coming to Tasmania. People say it is in the wrong place, but there is no other place for it. Have a look at Hobart - we are in between a mountain and a river. It needs to be flat. It needs to be within walking distance of hotels, coffees, restaurants and all the things conference organisers need to make a conference happen. It needs to be there. There is no other place.

I am not saying it is easy. I am not saying the site is perfect. It is not. It is complicated. There is a lot of work to be done. We have a lot of hurdles, but just because things are hard or just because there is a potential problem, that does not mean we walk away. We cannot walk away. We have to make it happen. This is our job, to deliver these things and not just put their hands up and say it is all a bit too hard. We believe in it. You have to make it work. There are engineering challenges and there are traffic management issues - these are manageable.

It is very clear through my contacts in the AFL that there is a lot of goodwill for Tasmania. There is a lot of goodwill for the Tasmania Devils, but there are a whole lot of clubs who look at that $360 million and go, 'Geez, that is money out of our pie and it is going to you.' They see that up for grabs, because the president of most of the clubs - even though there is a lot of goodwill - is there for their clubs. They are not there for Tasmania; they are not a charity. They are there for their clubs. They want to fight for their clubs. There are a couple of clubs, as people would know, who are in a bit of strife and they need to rebuild their list. We are looking at draft concessions as we speak, so they are not happy about that. We cannot give them an excuse to walk away. 

In 2023, there was a debate about the stadium and these matters in this place. I shared a letter that was sent to me from a constituent, and it was a pretty powerful letter. I am still in contact with that person and their family. I believe it is appropriate that we remind ourselves that it is not just our attitudes and views, but those of the people who this impacts the most. That is the people of Tasmania. I want to read this into Hansard:

David,

I write from my personal address as this is indeed a personal note from my family and I. As a kid growing up in Risdon Vale in the late 1970s and 1980s and early 1990s, I learned some of life's greatest lessons, something I cherish and never shirk at recognizing, but back then, despite our Risdon Vale bravado, we had an unmistakable lowering of our eyes, a feeling of slight embarrassment, never truly deserving of things.

There were always those above us, and even as a Tasmanian, our big brother on the mainland always had nicer things and would belittle us. We seemed as Tasmanians to accept it, divide ourselves and always want others to lead and hand us our lot. I, like the most of the youth then, wanted to leave, and we did.

I returned and you soon find out that we have so much to be grateful for in living here, and that I wanted to contribute more.

The other day, though, I had to apologise to my children, something I'll be asking others to do personally should this rare opportunity that would be so socially and economically positive for us, not proceed. I apologised because I thought we had changed. I thought we'd grown to look up, be aspirational, take control and look to contribute in our own Tasmanian-branded way. That brand that is not just for the rarefied air but for something that brings all of us along.

Then pathetic self-interest and opportunism came in and we again folded ourselves backward. I needed to say sorry that we'd failed to change from the way things were back then. The mistruths, divisive, simplistic arguments against the stadium will need to have those held to account unless a way to bring this positive opportunity to fruition happens.

They will be held to account when they stand in front of no stadium, no AFL team, no visitor pipeline, ending seasonality, no social unity or health and recreation participation outcomes, and as we know, nothing still at Macquarie Point.
Those same people they pretend to represent will wonder: I thought if we supported no stadium that all the crises would go away.

We know that unity brings wonderful outcomes on many levels. Perhaps together we can tackle these crises, start truly reforming health, education and housing, build wealth and opportunity to bring us all along, work together on fixing structurally these key items. I know you and I know you support this. Thanks for doing so.

Please do all you can so our kids don't have to bow their heads and leave but they can look up and move forward confidently.

Thank you.

I am sorry; I did not expect to get so emotional. That is a contribution from a working-class family from Risdon Vale. I stand for them.

[12.38 p.m.]
Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I thank the member for his outstanding, heartfelt contribution. For me that contribution is so very powerful, and the very reason why for the last three years we have kept a foot in the door through all the criticism, all the obstacles, all the challenges, all the changes to the parliamentary make-up and the planning processes. It has been important to chock that door with one's foot, which is getting pretty sore, I have to say, because there are people who are desperate to close that door and slam it shut, and have that opportunity gone forever.

The member who just resumed his seat, with his own lived experience, is fighting for people in disadvantage in his communities and elsewhere. That says it all for why we stand here today. Ultimately the ninth point of this motion is that, without the multipurpose stadium, Tasmania will lose not only our AFL team but also the massive economic opportunities across business, events, sport and the arts for decades to come.

That is a lost opportunity. More than that is the lost opportunity to change a person's life trajectory, from one that is a pathway of disadvantage to one that can provide the opportunity not just to play for their team, whether that be AFL or AFLW, but to be part of something truly special - a whole new industry and a whole new economy, if you like, built around such a significant investment.

For many, we are at the crossroads. For decades we have been fighting for this team. I pay tribute to all the people that have fought for their own AFL team, whether they have been in community clubs, footy clubs, ministers, members of parliament, or premiers. Every person has made a contribution to the point that we have got to today, including the member who just resumed his seat, Mr O'Byrne, member for Franklin, minister in a government that got the $50 million with the current Prime Minister and then infrastructure minister, Prime Minister Albanese. This is why the PM welcomed the opportunity to make a contribution, so that Tasmania could realise that dream.

I cannot claim any football prowess like the member possibly could, by any stretch of the imagination. I did not have a true appreciation of the value of local footy clubs either, until I became involved with one in my local community. I am blessed with my local community. There would not be too many communities around this state that would have so much sporting participation and so many not-for-profit sporting groups than the local Latrobe community of which I am enormously proud. They have had a century, if you like, of building the community capacity and the skill to support not-for-profit sporting organisations.

There are other communities around Tasmania that do not have those opportunities; all that sporting infrastructure and the people with the life skills to support community activity like my community of which I am truly thankful. However, I see that changing with opportunity and investment in this area, investment from government and investment from the AFL and AFL Tasmania, which I will come to in just a moment.

When I became involved with Latrobe Football Club, I got an appreciation for the community around the club, the volunteers; the old diehards that raise dollars every single weekend to support their local football club; the goodwill amongst the club; the camaraderie, young men at that time training three days a week; footy game on Saturday; supporting each other in between; the committee and the elders of the club wrapping their arms around young men who were doing it tough, relationship breakdown, things are not going right wherever they might be at work or whatever else. That community and that wraparound support is so important. You see that in spades when it comes to local sporting clubs, but of course in football as well.

On reflection, I probably brought my committee at the time, and indeed the AGM, on a few occasions, to tears when I used to quote a parliamentary inquiry done by the Victorian Parliament in around 2004. I was president between 2006 and 2009. We won a premiership in 2010, but anyway. That is an insightful document, thick with information about the value of local football clubs to communities and local economies, and it is worth a read. It takes some time, but I used to quote from it to demonstrate that this club is more than just putting people on a footy field; it is a reflection of the community and that wraparound support a football club provides to people involved: people being volunteers at the canteen, raising money, the raffle tickets, the support of each other, the camaraderie, the pride in the community. It is so important, and it has an enormous social and economic value. This motion is beautifully articulated in terms of the opportunity before us.

I have one other anecdote about the Latrobe Football Club. One of my proudest moments as president of a club was bestowing life membership on a chap who had worked for the club in a volunteer capacity for decades and, for some reason, was never recognised. His name was Malcolm. It brought me to tears as I read the contribution he had made, and I can see him realising it was about him and his contribution, and his recognition. He was a chap as described before by the member. I could not have been prouder at that moment when I could see tears welling up in his eyes and those of the people around him who knew he was going to get life membership bestowed on him. It means so much to people.

We want that for all our clubs and the opportunity for Tasmanians, for the young kids right now who, through no fault of their own, are born into circumstances we would never be able to appreciate. I am so lucky I have been loved all my life and been comfortable all my life. I do not pretend to come to this place with any rough pathway to this place, as others have. What I fight for in this is knowing that people's lives will change as a result of this, whether that be playing on the footy field, getting the life skills and the passion and enthusiasm to be a committee member of the local club, or whatever it might be; sports management, being a physiotherapist. All these opportunities are before us as a result of our AFL team.

We have fought for decades. Everyone tried really hard but the AFL said no, closed the door - slammed it, actually, and was bloody rude doing it, and insulted Tasmania and Tasmanians in the process, which makes me angry. We should have been given our team all those decades ago. Now, we have that opportunity. The opportunity comes with some skin in the game, and that is our own investment per year, our investment in a high-performance centre and our investment in stadia infrastructure. Without that skin in the game, the door would be slammed shut again. That is what we have to realise when it comes to the decisions we make on the legislation that will be before the parliament. We have that opportunity and we cannot lose the opportunity for all the reasons that have been articulated in this motion and Mr O'Byrne's contribution.

An open letter today by AFL Tasmania highlights the real investment and impact: the $360 million committed, the $126 million dedicated to grassroots development - this is AFL investment, which we will also be saying no to if we say no to this legislation - and talent pathways up until the first decade of Tasmania's life in the AFL competition. The letter says:

This is a true game changer for footy in our island. Since the announcement in 2023, this investment has begun flowing directly with immediate results for local clubs, programs and communities. 

There is a lot of information in that open letter. This is an opportunity we cannot afford to lose.

[12.50 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I rise to make a contribution on behalf of the Labor Party. Thank you to the Independent member for Franklin for bringing this forward for us today. This has been a journey for a lot of parliamentarians, including the Labor Party. All of us have come to this with a different set of views. We have seen this issue envelop the entire Tasmanian political landscape over the last three years now and here we are, potentially nearing the end of what has been a long-running saga.

The question I have asked myself is: what happens if a stadium does not get built in this state right now, two years after a major national announcement where you had the Premier of Tasmania standing next to the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia at North Hobart Oval, announcing that we would build a stadium, get a team and be granted an AFL licence? Think about the national business community seeing that, seeing a commitment from Tasmania that we would build a stadium and get a team, and what would happen to Tasmania if that business community and its investment across the country looked at Tasmania and saw us not being able to deliver that. I believe it would be one of the biggest pieces of economic vandalism Tasmania could ever impose on itself if we demonstrated to the rest of the country that we were not capable of doing this.

It is going to take a lot of work from a political point of view, but also from a delivery point of view, to get this project delivered so that we can get the team and, let us face it, that is what so many Tasmanians are passionate about.

This has come from an announcement a bit out of the blue from the former premier, Peter Gutwein, three years ago. Am I right? Three years ago?

Mr Rockliff - March 2022.
Mr WINTER - There you go, March 2022. Out of the blue, it moved from the departure of that premier to the support for the project from the current premier, the support from the prime minister of Australia for the Macquarie Point precinct and, therefore, the stadium, the announcement from the AFL, and the critical appointments of the board. One of the great appointments Tasmania has ever made is the appointment of Brendon Gale, and also Kathryn McCann, perhaps less well known, but just as powerful a force and doing a fantastic job, who has been so engaging with us. I believe members right across the Chamber, even those who do not necessarily support the project, have had the opportunity to hear directly from the club about the reasons why the project is so important. 

All parliamentarians have a role to be honest and what I know, at least - I will not speak for others, but what I know from speaking to Brendon Gale and Kathryn McCann is that the team needs a stadium to be successful. I am in no doubt, and I am not in a position to argue with Brendon Gale about what makes a successful AFL team. I do not think anyone here is. He tells us that for the team to be successful, for it to represent Tasmania properly, it needs a stadium. That is undeniable and unmistakable. Therefore, parliamentarians are left with a choice. We are left with a choice: whether to support an AFL team or not. You cannot have it both ways. Tasmania Labor supports getting an AFL team, we support building a stadium so that we can actually achieve that, so we can actually get that.

That was a big choice for us, for myself and my team, a little bit over a year ago, when we decided to back building a stadium in Hobart. That decision was met with a mixed reaction, let us face it, but in leadership you have got to make decisions. You cannot sit on the fence as we learnt at the last state election. You have to take positions, and a position we took.

I have been lucky to have some successful moments in my political career, but I have to say the moment that will stick with me is the day that we changed that. I went to pick my son up from footy training that night and I walked down into the twin ovals, the bottom twin oval, and the dads and the mums and the kids saw me and they were ecstatic. They were so excited. None of them had ever said anything to me except one boy - he told me at the last state election, 'Dad is not going to vote for you because you are not backing the stadium'. The parents and the supporters of the Tigers that night told me that it was important for them that we supported building the stadium, because it was important to them that we got a team.

The idea of not delivering on this project is really one for those young people, not just at that club, but clubs all over Tasmania. If we do not deliver this stadium, if we do lose the team, who is going to go and tell all those kids doing Auskick underage football all over the state, 'That team we promised you, that team that you have been told about, is all going to disappear'? Who is going to do that? I would not want it to be me.

Tasmanian Labor has a job to do, though. We support building a stadium, we support getting a team, but I do not want this to be another berth 3 at Devonport. Even worse, I do not want it to be another underground bus mall that never happens at all.

I am concerned by the statements by Cricket Australia, for example. This cannot just be a stadium for football, it has to be a stadium - I want to be able to go see both the Tasmania Devils and the Hobart Hurricanes play at this stadium. It is really important that we get that right. I am looking forward to asking questions and delving into these issues so that we can make sure we have a stadium that is multipurpose. If the stadium is multipurpose, it has to at least have cricket in it. We cannot afford to have two stadiums in Hobart, one with only cricket played and one with football played. We have to have the Hurricanes, we have to have Australian cricket content at that ground and it is important we get that right. I am not an engineer but it does not appear as though these issues are insurmountable and I certainly hope that they can be resolved as part of this process.

I am also concerned about the budget and making sure that this project is affordable. It is an infrastructure project after all, and it should be seen in the same light of other infrastructure projects. On last year's budget, there was an almost $5 billion infrastructure pipeline over the next four years, or over the four years from that point. It should be seen in that context. It is a large project, but it is in the context of a $5 billion program - it is a $900 million, nearly $1 billion project in the context of a $5 billion infrastructure program. That is how it should be seen.

These issues will need to be resolved. We are looking forward to continuing to do the work around the legislation itself. I suspect we will have amendments that we want to make to it. I think people would expect us to. There may be amendments that we support, that the government support, but it is really important that we get a stadium built for Tasmania. We want to make sure that this project can be successful, that it is delivered on time and on budget. We are committed to making sure that Tasmania gets the AFL team that it has been wanting for decades.

[12.58 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I rise to give my contribution on this motion and add the Greens' perspective. Unsurprisingly to many of you, notwithstanding many of the points in here which we do not contend with, we will not support the motion.

I first acknowledge the passionate and emotional contributions just made by two members, and I think almost the Leader of the Opposition in terms of his contribution in relation to his footy team. I also want to say at the outset that not getting a Macquarie Point Stadium is not going to cancel local footy at Latrobe. The Premier's experience that he has passionately articulated here happened in the absence of a stadium and the absence of a team. No one here is talking about cancelling local footy. Let us be clear about what we are actually talking about.

In terms of Mr O'Byrne's contribution, I acknowledge the passion of his constituent, but I could point to a dozen almost daily -

Sitting suspended from 1.00 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.


MOTION

Macquarie Point Stadium - Impacts

Continued from above.

[2.30 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, when I was on my feet earlier, talking to this motion, I acknowledged the emotion in the presentations from both the Premier and the member for Franklin who has brought on this motion. However, I said that the benefits the Premier witnessed in the Latrobe Football Club are not going to be taken away if there is not a stadium. There will still be a Latrobe Football Club.

I also make the point that footy is not the only sport that wraps its arms around people, helps people out and gives them a sense of community and purpose. Community sport facilities in Tasmania are woefully underfunded and neglected. We have communities across the state calling out for new facilities, be it in soccer, the new multipurpose facility in my electorate, in New Town Bay, facilitating netball and other ball sports, the Glenorchy pool, basketball in Launceston or the Northern Tasmania Sports Facility Plan. Footy is not the only sport that can give people inspiration and a sense of community. While I appreciate the emotion, I believe it is slightly misguided. 

I appreciate the letter Mr O'Byrne read into Hansard and I do not seek to take away from that constituent's passion and sense of purpose. However, I was making the point before I sat down that there are people writing to us all the time about their challenges, about the fact that they are in incredibly difficult situations and struggling to find housing and support. We are having jobs cut in the family and domestic violence unit, for example. I had a constituent in Ulverstone who was 15 months pregnant and living in her car with her cat. We received a letter back to say that Homes Tasmania acknowledged - 

Mr Shelton - Fifteen weeks, not 15 months pregnant.

Mr BAYLEY - Fifteen weeks pregnant, I apologise. Homes Tasmania wrote back to us, acknowledging that situation is completely untenable, but she has been on the waitlist since 2021. That is completely wrong. When the government says it can walk and chew gum at the same time, I honestly wish it could. However, it is clear it cannot. We have a huge apparatus of government pointed at this Macquarie Point stadium, pointed at this single facility. Meanwhile, other critically important facilities and needs of Tasmanians go begging. It is completely unacceptable. We heard horrible situations in the ramping inquiry where people saw three sunrises literally from the ramp in an ambulance. It is clear that spending $1 billion on a stadium at Macquarie Point is not the priority Tasmanians want or deserve.

The Premier confirms a new stadium will not be part of Tassie's AFL bid. That is the deceit upon which this stadium is built and it goes all the way back to August 2022 in a story that is still on the AFL's website. It is said, and I heard it said in the debate, that there are lots of challenges and that they are manageable. I contend that it is clear they are not manageable, and that is exactly why the Premier pulled this stadium out of the Project of State Significance (POSS) process. 

He not only pulled it out of the POSS process, but fabricated and orchestrated an argument to do it, tearing down the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) at the same time. While the Premier comes in here and points at us for maligning public servants, which we did not do, it is you, Premier, who is on record tearing down the commitment and independence of the Tasmanian Planning Commission, even saying of the TPC publicly:

My view is that they went in with a predetermined view. From my point of view, it was not objective.

That is an atrocious thing to say about the independent planning commission, the panel stood up by virtue of the Premier's own motion in this place, all because it is clear that if the POSS process was to continue, it would not get a positive recommendation. 

I believe the Premier has made a judgment call here that the politics is easier to manage by getting the Labor Party on side, writing a blank cheque, bypassing the planning process, putting up this legislation, which is an absolute travesty, and avoiding a negative recommendation from the Tasmanian Planning Commission. Why else would you go to such lengths to tear down the planning commission, to orchestrate an argument against the planning commission and bypass the POSS process? Minister Abetz aided and abetted this with his allegations of apprehended bias and backing the cooked-up legal representation.

This was countered by the head of the State Service in a letter to the planning commission just recently, when the planning commission said that no matter what happens with this legislation, if this legislation to approve this stadium goes down, the POSS process continues because it is a legislative process. Despite the minister saying that the Tasmanian Planning Commission has an apprehended bias, despite the Premier telling a national newspaper he believed they have a preconceived view, the head of the State Service says:

Thank you again for the professionalism, expertise and substantial work of the commission on this important project.

It is clear that the case was cooked up.

A big chunk of this motion is anchored by the assertion that for the club to be financially viable, for it to succeed, for it to get the game-day revenue it needs, it needs a Macquarie Point Stadium. However, the Devils' own submission to the Tasmanian Planning Commission's report said:

Financial modelling for the football club assumes that while net stadium revenue from the first year of operation of Macquarie Point Stadium will be less than the AFL club average, a sustainable business model can still be established to support competitive football programs.

However, by way of illustration and comparison, were the Macquarie Point Stadium not an option and, instead, the Tasmanian Football Club was required to play at the existing stadium at Ninja Stadium, Bellerive, the club would be approximately $5.4-$5.9 million worse off per year.

We are having this whole argument about a Macquarie Point Stadium, creating this immense risk to the team itself because of the complexities and toxic nature of the site, which has not been remediated to suit a stadium like this, the fact that it will compromise our heritage values, all for $5.4-$5.9 million a year.

The Greens believe the Tasmanian Football Club can and will be successful no matter what. It is clear that Tasmanians have got behind it. It is clear the benefits are starting to flow without a stadium.

We are opposed to the legislation. It is a corruption and perversion of process to be doing this kind of parliamentary approval. We are not going to support the legislation when it comes before us. Regarding this motion, despite accepting some bits in it, we do not support it. 

[2.39 p.m.]
Ms OGILVIE (Clark - Minister for Innovation, Science, and the Digital Economy) - Honourable Speaker, it was great to hear the history wrap-up. Thank you, everybody, particularly those we have all been on the journey with. We have had a lot of men speaking today, so I think it is time for a woman's voice to be heard in this dialogue. As the previous president - 

The SPEAKER -Mrs Pentland is also keen to speak.

Ms OGILVIE - I will make it fast. Great, good, come up with me. As past president of the Southern Football League (SFP), I wanted to add a bit of dialogue about what this will mean for women's sports and our women players.

Back in the day prior to the current President's time, we got together as three regions, came together under the TFC banner, and we worked with the AFL to align all of the clubs with the strategy. We got a committee going that then became the taskforce that we took to Peter Gutwein. We did this because women wanted to play football. Women wanted to play football and they were not able to because in the main there were not enough ovals for them to practise on. There were also no women's facilities because the game is so old that many of the facilities were just built for men. We undertook an audit of facilities and that became a program of upgrade that we have rolled out. I am very pleased to be in the government that did that.

We will have the first AFLW team in the nation coming out of Tasmania. This is a very, very big thing. I concur with all of the other comments that have been made, but the business case requires a stadium.

[2.41 p.m.]
Mrs PENTLAND (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to briefly speak on the Independent member for Franklin's motion. He has been a passionate supporter of this project and arguably its most effective salesperson. Our best on ground to you when it comes to selling the stadium, David O'Byrne.

We have had some robust discussions over whether our state can afford this stadium as it is currently stands and whether the state has been treated fairly by the AFL. I think it is fair to say that we have agreed to disagree. I remain highly sceptical that the stadium in its current form is in the best interest of Tasmania. Most of this motion I agree with wholeheartedly. Sport can have an incredible positive effect on communities. The Devils are already inspiring young Tasmanians years before they have even run out into the ground. I reject the idea that you can only support the Devils if you are willing to pledge your allegiance to an unbuilt stadium with a price tag that goes up every other week.

The final point on this motion says that without the multipurpose stadium we will lose our AFL team and the economic opportunities that come with it. I have said all along that a new stadium should have been something that we work towards, not something imposed on Tasmania. I agree that the team success relies on world-class infrastructure, but I am not prepared to stand here today and pledge my undying support to the Macquarie Point plan, nor the government's legislation. On that basis I cannot support what is otherwise a very good motion.

[2.42 p.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, Football - I have never backed down to bullies in my life. We are being bullied by the AFL. We need to stand up to them. We deserve our side. I have only a few seconds here, so I will leave it at that.

A member - Well said, Mr Garland.

The SPEAKER - I have another 40 seconds to go. Does anyone else want to jump?

Mr O'Byrne - If that is okay?

The SPEAKER - If you are very fast.

A member - Bring it home.

[2.42 p.m.]
Ms O'BYRNE - In the 27, 26, 25 seconds I have left, I want to thank people for their contribution on this. This will be the defining issue of this parliament, in my view. Regardless of what happens with the legislation, this will be a debate that will be looked at for many years to come. We have a unique opportunity. I ask people in the House: think for the future. Vote for the stadium.

The SPEAKER (Ms O'Byrne) - With that, the question is -

That the motion be agreed to.

MESSAGE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL

Attendance of Legislative Council Ministers for Budget Proceedings

The SPEAKER - I am in receipt of a message from the Legislative Council, which is odd because they appear to have all gone on an excursion. I shall ask the Clerk of the House to read:

The Legislative Council desires to inform the House of Assembly that it agrees to the request of the Assembly in its message dated 28 May 2025 and has given leave for the honourable member for Windermere, Minister for Energy and Renewables, Minister for Parks and Minister for Sports and Events; the honourable member for Rosevears, Minister for Education, Minister for Disability Services and Minister for Women and the Prevention of Domestic Violence; and the honourable member for Prosser, the Minister for Infrastructure and Minister for Local Government, to appear before and give evidence to the relevant Estimates Committee of the House of Assembly in relation to the budget Estimates and related documents. 

CM Farrell, 
President, 
Legislative Council, 
28 May 2025. 


MOTION

Macquarie Point Stadium - Scrutiny Committee

[2.50 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, I can inform you that we will be requiring a vote today. I move -

That the House -

Calls on the Premier to, before Parliament adjourns on Thursday 5 June 2025, move a motion to establish a Scrutiny Committee for two days of the week of 16 June, to scrutinise the proposed Macquarie Point stadium bill, including an allocation of time, developed in consultation with Members of the House, to scrutinise: -

the Environment Protection Authority; 

TasWater; 

the Tasmanian Heritage Council; 

the Aboriginal Heritage Council; 

Stadiums Tasmania; 

Macquarie Point Development Corporation; 

the Department of State Growth; 

the Department of Premier and Cabinet; 

the Department of Police, Fire and Emergency Management; and 

the Hobart City Council.

I think it is pretty obvious to say at the outset that this stadium approval process has been dominating the conversations in parliament and the community over the last couple of months in particular, but the conversation of whether or not we build a new stadium has been in the public domain as a hot topic for a couple of years now, and at least over the last year.

I want to say at the outset that I recognise that obviously not all members in the Chamber have the same position on this bill. Clearly, that is not what I am debating or proposing that we debate here today. I am attempting, in speaking to this bill, and in the bill that we have brought forward, to clearly separate members' positions on the bill from the process of gathering information. This process is so that we can be fully informed and understand the issues, and properly represent the people who have voted for us when we come to the process of debating the bill in this House, which we all understand will be in a couple of weeks' time.

As it stands, the government has brought forward a process to approve the stadium that does not involve the standard planning scheme process that governs every other development in Tasmania. Right now, the Tasmanian Planning Commission is still continuing with the work that they were ordered to do by this parliament to assess the stadium proposal and to move through the POSS process to a recommendation that they will deliver to us, the parliament.

In that process, regulators and agencies responsible for providing conditions to a planning permit have provided their views to the Tasmanian Planning Commission in a series of submission processes in October last year and also again recently. Through those processes, issues have been raised by regulators on the public record about the proposed stadium development, and that is a process that is still continuing. 

The next step for the planning commission is to undertake public hearings and, in that process, to scrutinise members of public who have made submissions to the POSS and to speak with regulators who have raised a number of issues and concerns that they believe would need to be considered if development was to go ahead. Public hearings are part of that process. It is the opportunity for the public to understand the views of the regulators and to have the widest amount of information possible. That is part of the reason we have bought this motion to parliament today.
The process that the government has now taken, by putting out a draft special piece of legislation to bring a stadium bill to this place for approval, has been a very rushed one. With minister Abetz's comments and those of the head of Macquarie Point Development Corporation, they have admitted over the last couple of days that the stadium itself is only 50 per cent designed at this point, more or less. It is incredibly important for us, as members of parliament, to understand as best we can the full view of regulators and agencies about the permit conditions that have been circulated by the government for the draft bill they have circulated. 

At the moment, it is our view that the government is doing everything they can to make sure the project and its permit conditions, and every other matter to do with the stadium, does not get the proper level of scrutiny. It is obviously the process of taking it through parliament like this, when the stadium is not properly designed; it is not finished being designed. While there are so many questions, it is very difficult for us to have proper public understanding of what is being proposed or would go ahead, and for us as members of parliament to understand that.

They are working against the clock at the moment to make sure there is an opportunity for having true openness, transparency and information for us. The purpose of this is to have a committee where we would be able to understand from the regulators the issues and the information that they have provided to government and exactly what, if anything, is different in the permit conditions of the bill that we have.

We have to step up and look back and remind ourselves that this is the largest ever development proposal in Tasmania's history. It is the most expensive development proposal in Tasmania's history. It has a huge amount of community division. A large part of that is around the cost, but not only. There is significant concern about the impact on the site that has been chosen, the gateway to Hobart, such an important place with all the impacts that would flow for the Cenotaph which is such an important place of remembrance for people who have given their lives for us all; for the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra (TSO); for our heritage values which are the basis of our tourism; for the environmental contamination which we know is deep on the site; for Aboriginal heritage; for transport access; and for the views of the city. It is an enormous process.

In preparing the bill, what the government has done, whilst this separate process in parallel is being undertaken by the planning commission and will continue, the government has required agencies and regulators to write permit conditions as though, we were informed in a briefing, for a development that would go ahead. That was their direction: 'The development will go ahead; you need to write us a set of conditions so that we can build this stadium.' There are a number of permit conditions that appear before us in the bill, but not very many, and we do not actually have any idea whether the permit conditions that appear in the bill are what the regulators prepared for the government staff, and we do not know what the regulators think about the permit conditions that are in the bill.

In a proper planning process, the permit conditions would be mandatory and there would be no possibility of them being overridden without standard, formal planning processes. However, in this stadium bill, the proposal is that the minister can alter any conditions himself after parliament has voted on the bill. It is also clear in the bill and the enabling legislation report that the government has removed this project from what would normally be the standard oversight mechanism, the Parliamentary Works Committee.
In other words, other large projects that are ongoing, things to do with planning components, infrastructure, the operational matters of the big road projects, the bridges, all manner of other large infrastructure developments appear before the Public Works Committee and can be scrutinised at any point along the way of the process of those infrastructure developments being built. This will not occur under the government stadium legislation. There will be no possibility for scrutiny like that by members of parliament at any other point.

We are very concerned that what we will be coming to is a permit and a set of conditions prepared by the government with information from regulators and agency and we do not have access to the original information. When we received a briefing about this a couple of weeks ago from the from the deputy secretary of the Department of Premier and Cabinet (DPAC). We asked whether we could have access to the original reports that were to be provided to the government from each of those regulators.

We asked whether we could have access to the Environment Protection Authority's advice, the Heritage Council's advice, the Aboriginal Heritage Council's advice, Hobart City Council's views, TasWater, and we did not get a clear answer on that. However, it is pretty clear, from what we have got here before us, is that we certainly do not have anything like the original reports and advice from each of those agencies and regulators that were provided to the government. Why that matters is because we do not know what has been left out and we do not know whether the permit conditions that were constructed in the stadium bill in fact in any way match the normal requirements a regulator would have for a development to be built in the place that the Macquarie Point Stadium is proposed to be built.

What we have in the stadium bill are general conditions and there are specific conditions. There are 35 general conditions in four different areas. I am just noting, if you wanted to build a garden shed in your backyard and you submitted an application to the council, I reckon chances are pretty high you would have more than 35 conditions that you would have to adhere to. Honestly, the Land Use Planning and Approvals Act is pretty heavy when it comes to regulations.

I think it is worth reminding ourselves how scant the information is that we have before us. Let alone the fact, and this is a matter for the bill itself, that the minister will be able to make any changes he sees fit to any of the conditions, if it were to be passed by parliament, any changes can be made after the fact. We need to know, as legislators, what the implications are of the permit conditions that we have here and have specific conditions for each agency.

The EPA, on most infrastructure works of significance, prepares reports for a planning authority that start in the 50-pages length. They would usually - for something as complex as the environmental contamination that we are looking at on that site, the serious issues that were raised by the EPA, including the risk of asphyxiation of people in the underground car parks in the first floor; the leaching of serious and harmful environmental contaminants in flood in storm water into the Derwent polluting the Derwent; the logistics of how that dirt could be safely removed so as not to affect the health of workers, so as not to provide environmental contamination beyond the site and where it would go; the truck movements to get the soil out safely through Hobart and to a site to dump it - that is massive. Normally, in the normal course of work, you would expect hundreds of pages of conditions to be supplied to a planning authority to govern that sort of work.

In the permit conditions we have in the proposed bill by the government, there are four pages for the EPA. I do not know if the EPA thinks that is enough, maybe they do, but how would we know? How would we know if we cannot sit there and ask them the questions? Can you explain to us whether you think the conditions that have been prepared are reasonable? Do they match what you put in your submission? What has been left out? What would be the consequences of not having a permit condition for something that you have put into your submission that has not ended up in this bill? What will that mean? What are the risks of not having the full scope of the permit conditions that the EPA or another regulator might have recommended? We need to know that information. We have to ask those questions on behalf of Tasmanians, everybody.

Regardless of whether people want to see a stadium built or not, the majority of Tasmania for sure would want to know that the government was managing serious environmental contamination properly. They would want to have confidence in that. They would want to have confidence that the centre of Hobart was not going be a traffic snarl during and surrounding events. They would want to know that there are not going be additional harms done to the Domain and Cenotaph sites in addition to that which is already going to be caused if a stadium were to be built.

These are reasonable questions. We will not have an opportunity to ask them at any other point. We will not have all these regulators before us in the estimates committee process. We will not have TasWater there. We will not have Hobart City Council there. We also will not have those regulators in a space where they can answer questions and help us understand what their intention was in what they submitted to the government in a way that is not mediated by a minister.

It is so important, because the government has done a lot of this stuff behind closed doors. As we were informed in the briefing that we got, there were to be at that point two one-day workshops of government staff sitting there designing these permit conditions. They, the government staff, not the regulators - I would be interested to hear from minister Abetz whether that is true or not. Were the EPA, Hobart City Council and TasWater staff sitting there when the permit conditions for this bill were being written? That would be useful to know.

Regardless, we have a right to know and understand for ourselves the issues to do with pedestrian safety, heritage impacts, toxic waste disposal, the flooding, and the evacuation risks. We have a right to know whether the conditions have properly been prepared by the government or not.

Minister Abetz made a good point in a question this morning. He said, 'I am not a mechanic. I do not understand what the right thing to do is when it comes to the Spirits.' Well, we are not planners. We are people with brains, and we are people with a responsibility, but we are not planners. The government is taking this outside of the very process that they ordered, the POSS process. They are subjecting parliament to an unprecedented situation in Tasmanian history, a process which is by any measure extreme - we would call it corrupted. It throws out good planning processes.

It is also bizarre that at the same time there is another planning process happening in parallel with the Project of State Significance. They are planning to commence public hearings and they are going on at the same time. Who knows when we will get to hear the information from the EPA, TasWater, and the Hobart City Council that may well come to light in a process from the planning commission organised process.

What we know is that when we sit in this Chamber - in a process that the government has rushed forward so that we do not get to have that public information and we do not get to have the regulators really give vent their views - we will not have had a chance to ask them those questions and understand their views unless we have a mechanism to bring them before us in parliament.

Regardless of what you think about whether or not we should build the most complex, most expensive, biggest infrastructure project in Tasmanian history, I really hope that members will support us returning to parliament for our proposal, which is two days in the week after Estimates, before the Estimates reply week when the government is planning on debating the legislation - we understand latest information might have changed - so that we can call these agencies before us and have an opportunity to ask them the questions. Obviously, we are not scrutinising them, we are just seeking information. Obviously they have provided information to the government and we want to know what that is. We want to understand the changes, if any, in the permit conditions attached to the bill. That is the most important thing.

It is incredibly critical that Tasmanians have all the information about this large development that has not even stopped at a billion dollars. If it is only 50 per cent designed, who knows, that might only be 50 per cent of the price. I would not be surprised at this point if it might end up being $2 billion.

We have been called 'kooky' before, but we have been right every time.

Mr Abetz - You are not wrong there.

Dr WOODRUFF - We have been right every time, right from the beginning. 

The SPEAKER - Thank you, members, that will do.

Mr Ellis - How is the Eden Project going?

The SPEAKER - The Leader of the Greens has the call.

Dr WOODRUFF - I want to thank the other parties. We have had a chance to speak to not every Independent, but most of the Independents. We have spoken to both the other parties. We really hope that members will support this opportunity for us to have our best opportunity to debate this critical bill. I know that the information - it sends an important signal to Tasmania that there is nothing to hide. Those agencies should have the information that they provided be made public and we should have an opportunity to do a match between what is in the draft permit conditions, and seriously consider whether we are concerned with things that were not translated and whether it is a problem or not.

I strongly hope that other members will support this. It is not a lot of time - two days. Not every member would need to be there. We have not prescribed the days and we have not prescribed the way it would run, but we would expect, as I said in the motion, that it would be in an Estimates style running, so it is available for people from the public to listen, and it would be in some process of sworn testimony so that people would appear before members in a matter to be determined by the Chamber, some schedule of regulators and agencies so that we could have the conversation in more detail that we will not have time to have during the debate of the proposed stadium bill. I really hope that members can support this because it is fantastic transparency. It sends a good signal to people in Tasmania that we are all taking this matter seriously.

[3.14 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Minister for Business, Industry and Resources) - Thank you, Speaker. The simple fact is that no matter what conditions were to be applied, the Greens would be opposed to the stadium. That is a fact. The Greens do not dispute it. If it did not cost us any money, if it was only one metre high off the ground, no matter what the conditions, the Greens would still stand in opposition. That is why this motion is such a ruse. It is confected because no matter what information would be provided to them, they would still stand in opposition to the stadium.

If there were a genuine interest by the Greens in their request for information, you might be half-tempted to support their motion and their request. However, the simple fact is we all know what their position is. Indeed, as I understand it, albeit before my time, when the stadium was put to the process of the Project of State Significance, the Greens opposed it.

Why did the Greens oppose it? It was because at that time it was the only pathway for the project to proceed. Today, the Greens perceive the POSS project is the only pathway to stop the project. All of a sudden, they have had this conversion on the road to Damascus from being opposite the Project of State Significance to all of a sudden supporting the process.

Why on earth have they changed their minds? It is because they see there is the possibility of delaying the project to such an extent that it cannot come to fruition. I say to the Leader of the Greens: I now have in front of me the draft project permit, which was made available for public consultation yesterday, 42 pages of it. The Leader of the Greens with her affected chuckle, she really has mastered it, but it does not convince anybody because what it does is it hides the ignorance and the duplicity of the Greens.

In this document reference is made to other documents, which I suspect would be about two reams worth of conditions and matters pertaining to the stadium, but about 1000 pages still is not enough for the Greens.

Mr Bayley - Did not answer the questions of the planning commission.

Mr ABETZ - Today in Question Time - I was reminded just then by the Deputy Leader's interjection - when I said in an answer to the honourable member that there would be, if I were to be clothed with certain authority by the parliament, a requirement that I consult and act in good faith; the assertion was made public, Question Time, et cetera, that that was not the case. What that tells me is that the Deputy Leader of the Greens in his manic opposition to this has not even bothered to read the bill. Try clause 34 subsection 1: the words 'good faith' appear. Why do you deliberately seek to mislead the public on every occasion in relation to this? We set these things out clearly for the benefit of the public. We have had this bill out now for exposure and for comment, and it is clear the Deputy Leader of the Greens could not even get past clause 34 of the bill. That is the extent of his research in relation to this matter.

Let us be very clear as well, when the Leader of the Greens tells me that you need about 35 conditions for a garden shed, what that confirms to me is, minister for planning, Mr Ellis, we need to change things because it is getting ridiculous that you need 35 different conditions for a garden shed. I think we can all be agreed that might just be a little too much. However, this schedule with the draft project permit, it is extensive, it is thorough. If you bother to read the legislation, and I would encourage the Greens to do so because it is quite apparent they have not, any power that is exercised will need to be exercised in consultation with the relevant authority or agency that would be applicable to the particular permit. That should be something that I would have thought the Greens would appreciate, but as is their wont, the Greens in recent times, they are prone to this misleading, disingenuous sort of fits of hyperbole - everything is going to be corrupt; it is the end of democracy as we know it; it is an existential threat; and so the list goes on. After a while, the public, and quite rightly so, are starting to say they have cried wolf a few times too often and as a result it is starting to wear just a fraction thin.

Their support of the POSS process and other parliamentary requirements - can I remind them that those requirements were set out by this parliament? It is within the jurisdiction of this parliament to determine that those processes can be dealt with by way of amending legislation or superseding legislation. That which the parliament has passed in the past does not mean it somehow becomes holy writ. How do I know that it is not holy writ? It is because the Greens were opposed to the POSS process at the beginning, so it was of no consequence to them. They were against the process, undoubtedly because it was fatally flawed. It would be an existential threat to our democratic system and then insert all the sorts of hyperbole you want, which is the wont of the Tasmanian Greens. However, now all of a sudden the POSS process is just so fantastic and it has to be adopted.

This parliament, as the representative of the people of Tasmania, has the right to make the determination that it believes there is a better pathway forward for this project. Let us be very clear here: there has been no bullying in relation to the AFL. A favourite term - I saw a full-page advertisement in the newspaper asserting bullying by the AFL.

This stadium in the Hobart CBD with a roof was something that organically grew out of the Tasmanian taskforce way back in 2019. It was the Tasmanian suggestion, but now, because it was the Tasmanian suggestion, that is a bit inconvenient. What do we do? We just try to change the dial and assert that this is AFL bullying. No, that was the taskforce led by Mr Godfrey, if I recall correctly, who at the time recommended that there be a roofed stadium in the Hobart CBD.

That has been part and parcel of the discussion. It is not as though this has been rushed. This was a discussion held six years ago, well before I entered this place, and it has grown organically. It has grown in a way that today now boasts 210,000 foundation members for the Tassie Devils Football Club. Sure, not all of them are in Tasmania but a vast bulk, I would suggest, are Tasmanians and expatriate Tasmanians who share the aspiration of the Tasmanian government and I trust the Tasmanian parliament to ensure that we get this stadium built, and the quicker the better.

The Department of Premier and Cabinet has been engaging with the relevant authorities to develop the appropriate permits and conditions for the development of the stadium. However, this has to be doubted by the Greens. They have consulted with relevant authorities to draft the legislation, draft the permits and, what is more, because we are a transparent government, we have put this out for public consultation for three weeks. People can read every single word. Some have not even got to clause 34 yet in the bill, but I encourage them to take the next three weeks to at least get up to clause 34 so they do not continue to misrepresent the bill to the Tasmanian public. I am sure that other members of the public with a genuine and real interest in this matter will ensure that any suggestion they might have can come forward to government. 

We will listen. We will consider. Indeed, the draft project permit that I have in my hand incorporates a lot of the matters from the so-called independent assessment review from the Tasmanian Planning Commission. We have informed ourselves. On 8 May public submissions to the Tasmanian Planning Commission stopped. They were all made public. They have all been analysed by the government, and a lot of the matters considered and mentioned there have been incorporated.

What I would invite people to do is, rather than make assertions that are factually incorrect, please read the documentation, inform yourself of it and what it means, not what you want to spin it to mean so you can defeat the project and spoil the dreams and aspirations of many young Tasmanians who see the stadium as a sporting facility.

I, for one, see it as a lot more than that. It is a multipurpose stadium, one which, for example, will be able to attract interstate and international conferences of over 1500 people. What a great boost for our hotel industry, taxi industry, Uber drivers and all the tourist facilities and shops around the Salamanca area. They will undoubtedly be spending the dollars and yen and whatever other currency they might have, which will stimulate the Tasmanian economy. 

Then I hear from the Leader of the Greens that this is going to be a $1 billion stadium. Let us just park that for a moment. The idea is that, somehow, the Tasmanian people will be footing a $1 billion cost for this stadium.

Dr Woodruff - That is right.

Mr ABETZ - Thankfully, that will be on the Hansard, because we all know $240 million of that is going to come from the federal Labor government.

Dr Woodruff - No, it is not. Do not perpetuate a lie.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Mr ABETZ - A full one quarter of it is going to come from the federal Labor government. That is simply ignored. Then the $15 million from the AFL - simply ignored. The extra $360 million, which will help stimulate football all around Tasmania over the next decade - simply ignored. If this stadium does not go ahead, we forgo the high-performance centre down my way of Kingston for about $110 million; we forgo the $375 million from the AFL; we forgo the $240 million from federal Labor and, somehow, this is a good idea.

Some of us have an aspiration. Some of us have a vision. Some of us have a hope that Tasmania can get an iconic gateway to its capital city - something that will be aesthetically pleasing and culturally important, and be an economic driver that will provide jobs and sustainable, well-paying jobs, well into the future for at least a generation, and I would suspect for two generations, for about 40 to 50 years.
Let us be very clear: when the Greens and others seek to peddle this notion that you can have a team - and remember those stickers? 'Yes Team, No Stadium' - all of a sudden they realise to play footy you might need a stadium.

Mr Bayley - We have two.

Mr ABETZ - All of a sudden they deleted the 'No Stadium' to read 'No New Stadium' because they realised how idiotic that campaign had been for the last 12 months or so that they had been running it, and the community response to it. They had to adjust.

The simple fact is that Brendon Gale and those who are in the know in relation to what football needs indicate to us that we actually need a new stadium. What is there at the moment is not good enough and cannot be retrofitted. For those of us who have an aspiration not only for an upgraded York Park or an upgraded Bellerive, or now Ninja Stadium, we also want to see a convention centre as well that can hold a good 1500 people and all the facilities around it.

This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that we have been considering for 12 or more years since the member for Franklin was able to get $50 million from the now Prime Minister to help develop and consider the stadium and its future. We have had proposal after proposal that has fallen flat. This is one that has gained wings. It is flying high. It is flying well. With the support of this House and the other House and the overwhelming majority of Tasmanians who will support it when they see how beneficial it is, I look forward to seeing that stadium in operation.

We as a government will be opposing this motion. We know that it is not about transparency. It is not about allowing consideration, because no matter what, the Greens will be opposed. That is something that needs to be understood. Anything that might delay this process is what the Greens will jump on, hoping that the delay will cause the defeat of this proposal.

We are not going to play their game. We can see through it. The transparency of what the Greens are doing is, I think, obvious to the vast majority in this House. I would encourage all colleagues to vote against the proposal. I will cut my comments here to enable others to speak.

[3.32 p.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Thank you, honourable Speaker. I rise to speak on this motion No. 136. I will start by saying that the Greens have made it very clear that they will do everything in their power to stop the stadium. That is what they are telling their supporters. That is what they are telling voters - that they will do anything that they possibly can to stop the stadium, and so everything that they do has to be viewed through that lens.

What they are doing here is trying to set up a pre-legislation committee, which happens in unicameral parliaments a lot. That is what you are trying to do. But effectively, it will be a star chamber for the Greens to prosecute their agenda to stop the stadium.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Interjections will cease, thank you.

Mr WILLIE - The fact is that we are a bicameral parliament with plenty of checks and balances. We have a House of review next door that specifically looks through legislation clause by clause. They often stop debates; they have briefings. We have that protection. You are trying to set up something that often happens in unicameral parliaments where there is no House of review. This government is now in minority, so this House has an opportunity to operate in a similar matter in the debate. We can adjourn a debate if we want to, if we are unhappy with the answers that are coming from the government. We can order the government to produce documents; they are in minority. We can amend the bill. There will be plenty of opportunities to scrutinise this legislation and maybe behave a little bit different from the way this House has in the past.

The Labor Party starts from a principle that we will support the stadium through the parliament. Do we want to improve it? Of course we want to improve it. We want to make sure it is the best it possibly can be, and that is exactly what the Premier and this government should be doing too.

My criticisms of this whole process are on the public record. I have been very critical of the Premier and senior members on that side. There was no Treasury advice that informed the decision. The Premier made a captain's call and signed the agreement without showing it to the Cabinet. One of the biggest deals the state has ever signed; failure of collective governance on that side. Senior ministers on that side, particularly ones concerned about finances, should have asked to see it. Did they see it before it was signed? No, they did not.

There has been failure after failure on that side, including three planning processes. Major Projects was the first process. People watching Tasmania at the moment - 

Dr Woodruff - Why would you not want to unpack all that?

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens.

Mr WILLIE - You watch some of the football shows and the commentary around Tasmania at the moment. It is embarrassing. They are seeing this government flailing around trying to establish different processes, they are seeing the debate in Tasmania and they are thinking -

Mr Bayley - So, we manage our governance based on The Footy Show?

Dr Woodruff - So concerned about the Spirits, and you are not interested in the stadium.

The SPEAKER - Interjections will cease. 

Mr WILLIE - 'We have given them a football team - can they not just get it done? We want to have them in the national competition.'

Mr Shelton - We are not the ones who changed our minds. 

Mr WILLIE - Hang on - 

The SPEAKER - Interjections will also cease from you.
Mr WILLIE - If you want to interject like that, I will give you a bit of a history lesson because the Premier stood in this place in 2022 and said the stadium was not part of the bid, stood in this place, knowing full well it was, because they had signed up to 11 workstreams with the AFL, including a stadium, so do not lecture me about changing positions.

Dr Woodruff - What about Labor? You were 'No stadium' then.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens, you are already warned. You get your second warning now. This has to stop. 

Mr WILLIE - It has been very amusing watching the Leader of the House lecture the Greens about the POSS process. It is true; they did vote against the POSS process. Now they think it is the best thing ever. However, you also established the POSS process because you fell into minority with John Tucker and Lara Alexander defecting from the government. I remember sitting in briefings at that time and the government was talking about the POSS process being the best thing since sliced bread. It was going solve all these problems: 'It is a very rigorous process - economic, social, environmental - weighs up all of these things and we will get a good decision.' They told us at the time that it was much better than Major Projects. However, in recent times, the government has come into this place to character-assassinate people and start trying to destroy the POSS process it established itself. It is farcical. 

That was the second planning process they went through. Now they are trying to move this through the parliament with enabling legislation. It has happened in the past. The parliament building that the Greens' office is in came about through enabling legislation. There is a precedent. Other states are moving stadium legislation for the Olympics through a similar process.

The timelines in the agreement are what they are. We had an election. The stadium has to come out of the ground this parliamentary term or there will be no teams. You are doing everything you can to make sure there are no teams, which would be a crying shame for this state. There would be investors on the mainland looking at Tasmania. They will see a state that makes commitments but cannot keep them. They will see a state government flailing around like it is, that cannot deliver predictability, certainty and deliver on the things it commits to. It will be devastating for our economy. 

It is not perfect, and I am the first one to admit that. It is not going to be easy. I am the first one to admit that. In the short to medium term, this is going to be very challenging, particularly for the government of the day having to build this thing and finance it. It is going to be a challenge. However, I believe, in 30 years when we look back and we have these AFL teams, it will be the right decision. Yes, it is going to be challenging for some members in this place to work through this process, but the Greens are coming from a position where they want to do everything they can to stop this. 

If you want to have good oversight, perhaps entertain a referral to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). That is something I would consider. The Public Accounts Committee is a respected committee of this parliament that has a track record of looking into financial matters and getting to the bottom of things. It is a respected committee of the parliament that has a proven track record of looking into controversial matters that the parliament is having difficulties with, delving deeply into it, getting answers and making good recommendations to government. Perhaps the PAC could have a role here if it is approved by the parliament. That is something I am happy to entertain. However, I am not happy to entertain a Greens kangaroo court purely designed to try to stop the stadium. That is what they are trying to do here, and we will have none of it because the Labor Party has been on a journey. I have been honest about that, too. We support the stadium because of the timelines in the agreement. It is the only way we are going to get the teams. 

This government has done a terrible job in selling the business case for the teams. If more Tasmanians understood that, I believe there would be more support for this project. I often talk that through with people in the street and they say, 'I did not understand that.' The government has done a terrible job of talking about the financials and making the team financial. There needs to be $18 million a year generated through stadium revenues, corporate partnerships and memberships. If we do not have a stadium facility that can deliver that, we do not have a financial team and we do not have success. The team will fall over. 

This government has not explained that very well to the Tasmanian people. If they had done that better, I believe there would be more people in support of it. People like Brendon Gale are not wrong. They have successful histories in the AFL running clubs and know what it takes to run a successful football club. Brendon Gale understands the business case. He understands what the team needs for success and longevity. This government has done a terrible job selling that.

We will not support this motion. There are plenty of mechanisms within the parliament for scrutiny, which I have explained. This is nothing more than the Greens trying to use forums of parliament to do everything they can to stop the stadium. We will not have it. We support the jobs, we want to see the teams, it is going to be difficult, but we just need to get on with it now.

[3.41 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to add my voice to the motion put forward by the Greens today and indicate at the outset that I will support it. 

I will start my contribution in the way the minister for All Things Stadium often starts his contributions with the words 'The simple fact is that no matter how reasonable the scrutiny might be, this government and this opposition will oppose it'. That is the simple fact we have before us today. It has played out in quite a lot of detail here this afternoon in the debate of this motion. 

This scrutiny committee makes sense. It is a basic principle that when matters come before this House, we have an obligation, on behalf of Tasmanians, as custodians of the money they entrust us with and the rule of law they entrust us with, to scrutinise matters that come before us. We do that in a number of ways, but when it comes to a project of this magnitude, we should be looking to add additional scrutiny because it will have an impact, whether you are for or against it, whether you believe it is a great thing or a bad thing, for generations to come, and it deserves scrutiny.

The scrutiny committee is an opportunity to put on the parliamentary record the answers to key questions about this enormous project. Those questions may or may not change the members of parliament's vote on the matter. It does not really matter if it does not change the Greens vote or my vote; it may change another member's vote. 

The most important thing, though, is that the answer to any questions we get the opportunity to ask in scrutiny are on the public record. We can then use that information after the fact to hold this government and future governments to account. We do this all the time. In fact, we are going to do it in a couple of weeks on the budget. Often the scrutiny in budget Estimates does not change the outcome of the vote on the floor the following week. It rarely does. However, it is an important opportunity to engage in scrutiny because the answers we elicit through the budget Estimates process is a mechanism we can use later to hold the government to account, to hold a minister to account, for example: 'Minister, you said it would be X amount of dollars, and now it is Y amount of dollars.' It is an important avenue to get information on the public record, to ensure the government is clear about its intentions, its promises, its commitments to the community and to hold them to account. 

It is completely unreasonable for the Labor Party, as an opposition party, to suggest that this scrutiny is not needed. It is a new position from them. What I am hearing from them today is that their new position on the stadium, and they have had multiple positions on the stadium, is 'Yes Stadium, No Scrutiny'.

I thought beforehand we were at the position of 'Yes Stadium, Yes Scrutiny', but it appears today that they have changed yet again.

This is an opportunity to show the community and their constituents that they were at least asked questions, to at least ask tough questions of the government. We have a project before us which is only 50 per cent designed, which has already had significant cost blowouts. This morning, the Premier refused to say that he would release detailed capital costs and operating costs for the public or for the parliament to scrutinise before he expects us to vote on this.

At lunchtime in the adjournment when I was at the front talking to members of the public about the situation that we do not know what the final design is - it is only 50 per cent done; that we do not know what the final costs are; we cannot possibly know what the final costs are; it is only 50 per cent designed - they were gobsmacked.

They said to me, 'If I were to apply for a planning permit for my house, how would I do that if I only have 50 per cent of the design? Do I go to accountants and say, 'Look, I have a concept for a house on this particular block of land? I am not sure whether it will be two storeys, maybe a unit or a townhouse or maybe some other kind of structure but I have a concept for a house. Trust me. Put some planning permits around that and conditions. We will sort the detail out later on.' That is not how things work. If I went to the bank and said, 'I have a concept for a house. I think it is going to cost about this amount of money. I do not have a detailed plan or a design; I do not have builders' quotes, things like that, but trust me, this is how much money I need,' the bank is going tell me to turn around and walk back out the door. However, this government wants us to approve it all and this opposition does not even want to question them about that.

There is an opportunity for scrutiny here, additional scrutiny to do your job, and you are not going to support it. It is gobsmacking.

Mr Bayley - You do not have to turn up. Send one of your other members, and do not even come. Do not deny us.
Ms JOHNSTON - Exactly. The arrogance of this opposition to suggest that the others in this place do not want to ask questions or deny the opportunity for others to ask questions, and the crossbench is quite diverse. There are more on the crossbench than there are in the opposition here.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Interjections will cease. The member will be heard in silence.

Ms JOHNSTON - There are more on the crossbench than there are on the opposition benches, but the opposition is going to vote with the government to deny proper scrutiny.

That is an appalling state of affairs. That is not democracy. There is no harm in asking questions. Indeed, I would suggest with this opportunity there is going to be plenty of fuel for you in the weeks and months and years ahead to hold this government to account, to show them up for what they really are.

That is what Tasmanians expect, but you are going to let this opportunity slide. I am totally gobsmacked. It is not the right thing to do.

I ask that the opposition reconsiders its position on this because it has a responsibility and if it is not going to scrutinise, it is not in opposition. It is an opposition missing in action. That is what the community is constantly telling me. That is reflected in the EMRS poll we have seen recently.

Clearly, Tasmanians are looking for someone other than the major parties to do the heavy lifting when it comes to democracy and to holding governments to account.

It is really disappointing. I thought this was a very reasonable motion by the Greens to give an opportunity for parliamentary process to be enhanced but, clearly, the opposition and the government are on a unity ticket when it comes to scrutiny, and that is no scrutiny.

[3.48 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Thank you, honourable Speaker. I also rise to speak on this notice of motion from Dr Woodruff in relation to scrutiny and how important it is for us to do our role in this House effectively. To be effective, we need as much information before us, but when we have this bill for the Macquarie Point Stadium, or the consultation draft, that is currently out, we can see how vast that amount of information is.

When the Macquarie Point Development Corporation put in their submission to the Project of State Significance process back in September of last year, we knew that there was a vast amount of information before us. There were 56 appendices in that first submission in September 2024. Then, in January 2025, there was more information provided when asked because it had not covered everything that the TPC required. There were 27 more in January, nine more in February, and then four more submissions in March.

That is a significant amount of information alone to distil, a lot of technical detail. One of my favourite appendices was the appendix on transport. I think it was appendix N, which was looking at the transport links and supporting infrastructure to the Macquarie Point stadium. That in itself is an interesting conundrum for the government because a lot of that enabling infrastructure is not a part of this application.

We have a very strange, half-done, backyard-shed development. A mega project such as this is something that should be done very well. It needs to blend with and respect the heritage. It needs to be part of the urban form in the area. It needs to have the transport and emergency response for the thousands of people who would use the facility for any event. All of those things need to be considered very carefully.

This is, as has been said, the largest type of project that this state has ever seen. When I was at council - I had spent many years as a councillor - and having the requisite information before me to make a decision, whether it was a planning decision, when acting as a planning authority, whether it was a decision on the community development committee; all of those things were much better informed when I had all of the information before me.

The information that I got - it was important that other people received as well. We know full well that the Legislative Council - and I am quite envious of the situation that they have - are provided information before they consider a bill. They sit down together and they are briefed. I think they have even had briefings this morning on forthcoming bills.

We have had 12 months in this place, for those of us who are new, having been elected in March last year. When we are considering a bill, such as the bill that was considered yesterday, there is a chance where you go into Committee, those people who are in the Chamber can go into committee, and they can ask questions relating to clauses or they can ask questions during the second reading speech by the minister. However, you do not always get a direct answer in relation to what you might ask. When we are considering something as massive as this kind of project, we all need the same information. Whether we are for or against, we need to be properly informed. This is what this notice of motion from Dr Woodruff sets forth.

It is not a big ask. It is only two days of sitting down and considering this very thoroughly with the relevant authorities and relevant parties, such as the City of Hobart, to have information available.

I attended a briefing that the City of Hobart planners and urban designers provided for us. The CEO and senior planners were at that briefing. I think Mr Bayley, Mr Garland and Ms Johnston might have attended, and unfortunately that is only a few of us who heard the relevant information.

If we have that set forth on two days of scrutiny committee, then it is much more effective, because we are all getting the same information. I cannot impress upon this House enough the importance of getting relevant information.

It would be really good to hear from the planner who is setting the planning conditions and to hear how they have reached that decision. If anybody wants to amend this motion and put that as part of who we scrutinise, that would also be a really useful part of getting all the information before us.

When councils have that chance to have a look at things before they make decisions, they have workshops. They sit down and consider things in workshops.

Mr Behrakis - Then the Greens vote against it anyway.

Ms BURNET - Sorry?

The SPEAKER - Thank you, we will have no interjections.

Ms BURNET - Those things are really important. I want to add a few things in response to a couple of things that the minister has said. He referred to clause 34 and I might add, minister, I have not read all the information that was dropped on us yesterday. I am so glad that there are three weeks for people to get their heads around that. I look forward to sitting down over the weekend, hopefully in the right environment in a warm room with the doors locked, and reading the information that we have before us, but clause 34 - this is about the good faith matter, or the minister acting in good faith.

Clause 34, from my understanding, does not have anything to do with the minister acting in good faith. It limits all rights of appeal for any act done in good faith. We can see here that there is no compulsion for the minister to act in good faith, no need at all.

The minister also said, 'The quicker the better' to get this stadium built. It is not about being quick about getting something built. I think this government does not know how to do good planning. Good planning takes time. You do not get rushed by any third party. You do not have to dance to the tune of an organisation that is telling you what to do. In fact, if you were going to do that, you would really go about renegotiating any deal rather than saying, 'Oh, I cannot do anything. Everything rides on the deal that we have already.' I do not buy that. I cannot consider that that is an acceptable way of walking away and never ever touching the arrangement that we have before us.

I might add that Mr Willie said that we could not renegotiate the deal with the AFL. It would be so good if we had the opposition functioning as an opposition and saying, 'Actually, you really have to try to renegotiate that deal.'

We have the crossbench doing the work that Labor should be doing.

	Mr Willie - How is the renegotiating going?
	
	Mr Bayley - Why would they negotiate with you rolling over the way you do?

The SPEAKER - Mr Willie will cease interjections. Thank you, Mr Willie, and the Deputy Leader of the Greens.

Ms BURNET - Those points are so important to make in relation to how important it is to look at things really thoughtfully, to consider things with a great deal of information, the right information, the right people to speak about any concerns. It is about the concerns that this House has.

I do not like the way that the government is introducing draconian changes to planning and how planning is done in this state. It is reprehensible and it is really something again that I wish the opposition would wake up and question. We are not seeing that at all. We are just letting good acts be turned into acts that have no legitimacy. It is appalling. It is very concerning. I have had a lot of conversations with architects, planners, urban designers and people in local government who are incredibly concerned about how this parliament is putting the wrecking ball to planning and not considering how strategic planning is done. It is too important, and yet we do not seem to care.

We have a responsibility in this place to consider how we can continue doing our work and what we deliver for our community, the environment and for social outcomes. I feel that we are missing the point if we do not think about what we have before us. The scrutiny committee will help us with this.

If you think about the $945 million that the state will put in - probably more than that, but this is what we are considering - that would equate to about $1600 per Tasmanian. Why would we allow that to happen when we consider that against any other stadium build in Australia? How is it that we would be saddled or saddling Tasmanians with so much debt for a stadium that would have very few football matches? As much as it was a very emotive debate this morning from Mr O'Byrne's motion, and it was important to hear those emotions and how important a team is, it should not come at any cost. We need to be here to scrutinise and do our best. We need all of the information in a very digestible way. We need to question those experts who can help us with delivering anything, no matter what it is, to the best of our ability and the best legislation that we can provide as well.

[4.03 p.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - I was not going to speak this afternoon, but I feel compelled to do so after the contributions of some of the members on this other side. When they are winning, it is collaborative government and it is everybody working together. It is a great thing. When they are not, they are whingeing, and that is what we get time and time again.

We are the opposition. You are not the opposition. 

Dr Woodruff - You have only got one job, which is to scrutinise the government.

The SPEAKER - Interjections will cease, thank you.

Ms DOW - I will tell you one thing. Ms Johnston is not an Independent. Ms Johnston is a quasi-Green. The majority of the time she votes with the Greens in this House. You have seen that again today.

Mr Bayley - Does that make you quasi-Liberal?

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader of the Greens.

Ms DOW - We will make determinations on our side of the House in our party room about the way which we vote on issues that come to this House. The Liberals will do the same. You can do that, Ms Johnston, with the Greens in your party room, and you have done that today.

Mr Willie has put very eloquently our decision around this notice of motion today to the House, and I commend him on that. I thought it was an excellent contribution.

The problem that Ms Johnston has in this place is that she is actually propping up the government. She has a supply and confidence agreement with the government. She struck a deal with them in return for an extra car park position.

Members interjecting.

Ms Johnston - How many confidence motions have you voted for? How many have I voted for?

The SPEAKER - If members are personally offended, there are Standing Orders they can use. Otherwise, the member will be heard in silence.

Ms DOW - In propping up the government, in effect she is propping up the stadium project. You do not hear her talk about that very much in this place.

Mr Bayley - She is voting against it.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader of the Greens, that will do. You are warned.

Ms DOW - As I said, we are quite within our rights - that is the process of democracy, to determine in your party room how you vote on a particular notice of motion. We have done that today. We do not need to be directed by the Greens about how we scrutinise legislation that comes to this place or any type of project or policy taken by this government that comes before the Tasmanian people or before the Tasmanian parliament. We make those decisions; we will not be guided by the Greens.

We will be scrutinising this project, and we have said that at length in this place and in the public arena. We remain committed to that, and that will not change. There are other mechanisms for scrutiny to be applied. It was not the Greens that came in here from day one of this new parliament and scrutinised this government over the Spirits fiasco. If we had not done that, I doubt that the Tasmanians would ever have been given the truth about that project. That project continues to be an absolute debacle and has cost Tasmanians in excess of millions of dollars. Quite frankly, it is a disgrace.

Do not criticise us for the way we scrutinise legislation, policy or the actions of this government. We take great pride in the way that we scrutinise this government, and we will continue to do that. We will not be lectured to by you.

[4.06 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF - I will provide some advice to Ms Dow - 

Ms Dow - We do not need it.

Dr WOODRUFF - A teaspoon of concrete -

The SPEAKER - Is this your motion?

Dr WOODRUFF - Yes.

The SPEAKER - Then you cannot - sorry, then you would be closing the debate.
Dr WOODRUFF - I am closing?

The SPEAKER - You cannot close when there are other people on their feet. I am sorry, I mistook the fact that it was your motion. I will give the call to Mr Garland. Had you been the only one jumping, it would have been appropriate. My apologies.

Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, Labor claim they are wanting to scrutinise the stadium project and ask the hard questions. They have tried to walk both sides of the street - and how is that going for you? According to the recent EMRS poll, despite the Liberal Party descending to depths of unpopularity they have not seen since 2009, your vote sits at 31 per cent. The voters are not flowing your way.

The public sees through your position. Until you show some leadership, you are doomed to opposition. The Greens motion has called for witnesses to appear to answer questions to explain specific planning conditions - questions that cover complex matters that are not dealt with in detail in the materials that have been provided so far. This is what responsible government should do: ask questions. The bigger the development, the more questions we should be asking, especially with this government's track record.

This is exactly what Labor said - that they wanted to scrutinise the project. This motion allows them to do it. Labor have now abandoned that position; they have given up on scrutiny. The opposition in this parliament are the crossbench - the Greens and the Independents. It is no coincidence that voters fleeing the Liberal Party are coming to the Independents and not Labor. It is because, as Ms Johnston said, we are the real opposition in this parliament.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr GARLAND - You can laugh. Mr Willie says he would be more open to a referral to the PAC. What difference does it make if it is the PAC or a House committee? I want to read the final paragraph of yesterday's PAC media advisory on the Inquiry into Tasmanian Government's Process into the Proposed Hobart Arts, Entertainment and Sports Precinct - a committee which Mr Willie sits on.

The Committee reaffirms Tasmania's commitment to establish an AFL team but stresses that public trust and long-term viability depend on transparent governance, realistic costing and accountable delivery. If constructed, the Macquarie Point Stadium project is a high-stakes, high-cost commitment that requires full transparency by government, including all costs and benefits, and it must be managed accordingly.

This is exactly what this motion will achieve - some transparency which leads to greater public trust. The only reason Labor votes against this motion is because it has been moved by the Greens. I say to Labor: grow up and do your job properly.

[4.09 p.m.]
Mr BEHRAKIS (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, this project would potentially have to be one of the most scrutinised projects in Tasmania's history, definitely in recent years. On scrutiny, additional scrutiny is useful if it helps inform decision-making. That requires people and participants going into it to be willing to do something in good faith, not with the intention of setting up a star chamber.

We heard from my fellow member for Clark, Mr Willie, who rightfully said the members promoting this and supporting this motion stand outside this place, talk about how they will do anything they possibly can to stop this stadium from being built, and they come into this place and they use words like 'This is reasonable scrutiny,' and 'It is harmless, it is just reasonable scrutiny.' However, that does require people to be embarking on this in good faith, which just simply is not what we are hearing from those who are moving this motion.

Let us be honest: if this project is not approved, it means no AFL team. It means no high-performance centre. It means no investment by the AFL into grassroots community football, investment totalling some $360 million last I checked. That means no investment by the AFL into community football, no boys and girls wearing our team colours, cheering for our team, singing our team songs. That means decades of hard work, determination, perseverance for Tasmanians to have their own team gone. I will note and acknowledge the emotional contribution by the member for Franklin, Mr O'Byrne, earlier today because it also means that those dreams and aspirations that he spoke of are shot.

Now, the stadium is what will set up our team for future success.

Ms Brown - Teams.

Mr BEHRAKIS -Teams. I will take that point, yes. Tasmanians deserve teams that are successful, that are sustainable and that is exactly what the stadium will contribute, because rather than it being something that we have been bent over a barrel for, it is actually a prerequisite to ensure that those teams are financially sustainable, and that they can continue to fund those very expensive costs of running an AFL team.

We hear the sanctimonious view in this Chamber who are clearly against this stadium, regardless of anything that might happen, actively campaigning against Tasmania's moment to take our stage in the national competition. What they are arguing for is to ensure that everything up until today has been no more than a wasted effort, destroying the dreams of Tasmanians, young and old, who have held dear hope that they can get this done. It is as simple as that.

This multipurpose stadium at Macquarie Point will be a transformational project that will create economic opportunities for Tasmanians in every corner of the state. Happily, we have bipartisan support. State Labor support it, federal Labor support it. Unsurprisingly, the Greens oppose it. Now, let us not pretend for a minute that their concerns that they raise in this place are in any way in good faith. Let us not pretend for a second that there are anything more than red herrings. Let us not pretend for a second that, if the stadium cost zero dollars, as has been said, or was no more than five metres tall, it would not have any impact on their opposition, because the only consistency that we hear from the Greens when it comes to anything to do with planning is their opposition, regardless of all their what-about-isms, regardless of anything else. They come in this place, they talk about how we should all listen to the experts, but I have seen and we did hear just a minute ago from Ms Burnet, fellow member for Clark and former fellow councillor -

Ms Burnet - Here we go. Have we not run this before, Alderman Behrakis?

Ms Rosol - No new ideas. Stuck on the same record.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, member for Clark. Ms Rosol, I can tell it is you even though you have a mask on.

Mr BEHRAKIS - who regularly railed and election-preached about how we should listen to the planning officers when those planning officers say something convenient for her. However, when planning officers make a case that something should be built, well suddenly the Greens know better. It is something we have seen time and time again.

We saw it when we heard the Greens talk about the height of the project, but at the same time they are perfectly happy with 50-metre bubbles. This government is 100 per cent committed to delivering this amazing transformational project at Macquarie Point. Yes, there are some legitimate concerns that have been raised and those are being worked through as per what has been released this week. 

The Greens' anti-everything voices: they do not want solutions. They do not want solutions to these concerns because they are not raising them in good faith. They just want more reasons to reject the project. That is the one thing that they are consistent with. I will take the opportunity, because I am not sure how much time I have left -

The SPEAKER - Six minutes left, but I do know there are other members who wish to speak.

Mr BEHRAKIS - Okay, well in that case, I will cut my contribution short. I was asked to correct the record for something minister Abetz had said. The draft permit does not have about a thousand pages of additional information as the minister said, it is actually 2531 pages. This is something that is a comprehensive document. It has had a comprehensive amount of work that has addressed those concerns. 

Now is the time for this place to be realistic about what the facts are, and the reality is if we continue to entertain these ideas of star chambers, and opportunities to frustrate a process that Tasmanians have been waiting decades for, then the outcome would be no team, none of that investment from the AFL, and a complete missed opportunity for Tasmanians.

[4.15 p.m.] 
Mrs BESWICK (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I welcome the chance to speak on this motion, which caused the further scrutiny of this stadium project. I know it does sound a little sanctimonious, but I think that it is a very important thing for us to be doing. I remain highly sceptical about the stadium proposal as it stands and whether Tasmania can afford the additional debt it will add to the state government. Throughout this whole saga I have tried to be as constructive as possible and I would like to say, Mr Behrakis, that I am not standing here and being obstructionist.

I believe this motion falls into the constructive basket. It is not unreasonable to subject a project of this magnitude to some additional scrutiny. The government's decision to dump the Project of State Significance process attracts broad criticism and creates fear that it would avoid the scrutiny that the planning commission was providing. I believe this motion can help offset those fears and send a message to the public that the parliament is determined to do its job. I put it to the government that its project that is set to cost more than $1 billion, that around 60 per cent of Tasmanians do not support, deserves an unusually large amount of scrutiny. 

It concerns me that the government seems to find the intense scrutiny of this pet project annoying or inconvenient. It deserves to attract every magnifying glass in the state. Even if you are a passionate supporter of this project, do you not want it to be as good as possible? That only happens if every single element of this project is examined and all potential challenges are addressed. 

This feels like it could be a very useful exercise at this stage of the process. Many of the members here have pointed out that the upstairs uses a similar process when they go through the bills, but it is important that we are informed and we on the crossbench particularly take a little bit more informing. We do not have big teams so that someone can go out and do one thing; we have to do it for everything. It is a simple measure; I do not think it is a huge measure. It is quite reasonable what Dr Woodruff has requested here and I am definitely in agreement with it.

[4.17 p.m.]
Mr JENNER (Lyons) - Honourable speaker, I do not envy you your job. 

The SPEAKER - Sometimes I quite enjoy it, Mr Jenner. 

Mr JENNER - The way we have acted today as politicians bickering at each other is exactly what the public hate.

I have read the draft enabling legislation, minister Abetz, and I do have slight concerns and I would love to be able to speak at length at some sort of scrutiny panel. It does reduce local council powers. It removes historic protections that have been in place under the 1884 act, it bypasses local council control over boundaries, it removes political oversight completely, gets rid of both accountability and transparency, and takes the project out of any Public Accounts Committee hands.

That is the reason I would like the extra scrutiny. Whether I am for it or against the stadium, I do not think any amount of scrutiny on a project this large should be bypassed. I know we have had lots of scrutiny, and I appreciate that, but there is no reason we cannot have a little bit more. Perhaps if we had more scrutiny on the TT-Line we might not be in the place we are now.

[4.19 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, it is deeply disappointing for Tasmanians that Labor has abandoned its role and responsibility as the opposition to scrutinise the government. It is the core job of an opposition, but Labor calls it whingeing and time-wasting to want to have this scrutiny of our regulators, who have made it so clear in their submission. The issues they have raised are enormous. They have submitted pages of reports, and it is clearly not in evidence in what the government has provided. We need to understand the real risks and costs of this stadium before we go into a debate. I do not know why Mr Willie thinks this is grandstanding. We believe it is asking the questions Tasmanians demand. It is a shocking abrogation of the Labor Party's duty. Shame on them.

Time expired.

CHARTER OF BUDGET RESPONSIBILITYAMENDMENT BILL 2025 (No. 23)

Second Reading

Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the bill be now read a second time.

This is a timely debate. The Budget will be delivered tomorrow. It is a big day for the Tasmanian parliament and Tasmanian people. There will be members of this House who will have plenty to say about the budget and the trajectory of the budget, myself included. I am giving members an opportunity today to require the government to get Treasury to produce more analysis of the Budget. I have a position that Treasury should be doing more of this work in terms of the budget analysis, but also economic analysis for the Tasmanian economy to contribute to economic discourse.

I have also given members another opportunity after the budget session to consider some fiscal discipline measures. We have a government that is racking up the biggest deficits in the state's history. We have record debt. That will be another debate for members to consider.

There are a number of opportunities before this House, including this one that I am providing. We know there is support within this House for a parliamentary budget office. We do not have that yet. A parliamentary budget office is an independent financial office that can help members of parliament with budget analysis. We do not have that yet, but we can demand that this government and Treasury start doing a bit more of this budget analysis and economic analysis more regularly.

There is a history here when it comes to the Fiscal Sustainability Report, for newer members. In 2016, the first report was delivered. My understanding is that Treasury, at that time, took around nine months to deliver that report. They had to develop models for long-term projections. That report was called in by the Public Accounts Committee in around 2018-19, I believe, some questions were asked and Treasury realised that they needed to revise the report. An additional report was done and produced in 2019, and the Treasury had changed the models.

Following that, we had a subsequent report by legislation in 2021. Currently under the legislation, these reports are only produced once every five years. What this amendment seeks to do is to make sure that every parliamentary term, every government, is able to be scrutinised around one of these reports. This amendment bill also seeks to bring this report forward, to line it up with the constitutional parliamentary term and to allow the parliament to have further scrutiny of the budget trajectory by the end of the year. 

There is a little bit of background for members who are newer to this place. I had a look at the Treasury website and there was quite a helpful Q&A document there. I might read sections of it because it will be helpful for members to understand what the report is about. I will provide some commentary along the way. 

What is the report about?

The report provides a long-term perspective on the state's fiscal outlook beyond the reporting of the Budget and forward Estimates - using a 15-year projection period. 

The report examines long-term fiscal sustainability under a number of different scenarios.

Consistent with the requirements of the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act 2007, the Report has regard to current Government policies and anticipated demographic changes and provides early notice of potential long-term fiscal pressures for the State to inform future fiscal management. 

…

The report uses a number of measures to assess fiscal sustainability.

The measures are consistent with those presented in the Treasurer's Annual Financial Report, the State Budget and the previous 2019 Fiscal Sustainability Report.

This is concerning the 2021 report, obviously:

The fiscal measures are:

Net Operating Balance;

Fiscal Balance; and 

Net Debt.

The last report stated that:

Fiscal sustainability is the ability of a government to sustain its current spending, tax and other policies through a changing economic environment without threatening government solvency or defaulting on its liabilities or failing to meet committed expenditures. 

The reasons the 15-year projection is chosen is:

there is some level of knowledge of events that are likely to occur over the next 15 years but reduced certainty beyond that timeframe;
projections over a longer-term would likely follow the same trends established for the 15-year projection and not add further value in relation to assessing fiscal sustainability;
it is consistent with the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development's guidance on long-term reporting, where long-term is considered to be between 10 and 40 years … 

The report adopts four scenarios. The scenarios have been used in each of the reports so far, and they are chosen to present a range of alternative potential outcomes. Two of the scenarios are intended to show how adverse outcomes, in relation to expenditure or revenue, may impact on the state's future financial position. Each projection scenario is described briefly below.

You have the historical trends scenario. This scenario uses historical data to project expenditure and revenue, including known significant future changes, to develop projections that may arise in the future without policy intervention. 

There is a forward Estimates scenario. This scenario develops projections based on revenue and expenditure patterns over the 2020-2021 Budget and forward Estimates period. This scenario shows the impact of the state government's policy and fiscal intent as expressed in the 2020-2021 Budget. This is for the last report. 

If these arrangements were maintained over the projection period, then there is a high expenditure scenario. 

… most expenditure and revenue categories are projected based on their historical trends -

but some expenditure items have been projected at higher levels, including health, education and capital expenditure. This scenario shows the potential impacts on the state's finances of ongoing expenditure growth in the absence of policy responses to contain this additional growth or raised revenue. Arguably, we are on that high expenditure scenario at the moment under this government's trajectory.

Low revenue - under this scenario, most revenue categories are projected based on their historical trends, but some revenue items have been predicted at lower levels, including GST receipts, Australian government payments, and conveyance duty.

In the last report, the results showed predicted fiscal outcomes that are manageable in the short to medium term and the size of the corrective action required to maintain fiscal sustainability increases over the projection period.

The projections were developed using standard budgeting practices and were based on data that is consistent with that presented in the Treasurer's annual financial reports. Input data was adjusted for known or expected changes in revenue, expenditure and major capital projects to determine results for fiscal measures for each year of the 15-year period. All projections assume that there is no corrective policy action by the government. The scenarios presented in the report are projected based on different assumptions. They are not forecasts in that they are not attempting to predict what will happen in the future. No scenario is considered more or less likely.

Under the provisions of the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act 2007, the next report will be published on 30 June 2026, so next year. I will perhaps wait for the government to make their contribution, but I know that one of the arguments they will make is that if a report is produced this year, it will not include the actuals from the Treasurer's Annual Financial Reports (TAFR). As the act is currently drafted, it does not include the latest actuals from the TAFR on 30 June 2026 either. We can have that debate when the government raises it.

There are challenges that Tasmania is facing, that is well known, as presented in the last report. It has been some time since 2021 when we had that report. Things that were raised in that report included a reliance on Australian government funding - for 63.3 per cent of the budget back in 2021 the revenue source was from the federal government. It is now 65 per cent. That indicates there are fiscal pressures that are outside of our control. I have said in the House before that when 65 per cent of your revenue comes from the federal government, you need to be really disciplined in managing the budget. There are not a lot of levers you can pull to get yourself out of the mess that we are currently in. We need to grow our own-source revenue through growing the economy so that we are more in control like other states.

Greater demand and higher costs for providing services is an issue in Tasmania that we all know about, particularly around rising health costs. Expenditure on health services is growing at a rate that outpaces revenue growth, posing a significant challenge to fiscal sustainability. In the last report they outlined the projection - it was an actual - which started at 26.4 per cent. As a total share of the budget, it went to 32.3 per cent. Under a historical trend scenario in the last report, it said that it was projected to grow to 40.6 per cent of the overall share of the budget at the end of the projection. In a high expenditure scenario, it was 41.8 per cent.

We have demographic pressures too, which was outlined in the report. We have an ageing population, which puts extra demand on our health service, as well as things like expenses, growth and technology, expectations of the population in terms of the healthcare they are delivered. These are all putting pressures on the budget. However, our ageing population is increasing demand for services not only in health but the aged care sectors. We have population growth in immigration, migration levels, which generally reflect the economic cycles of the state. If you look at the latest population data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, we have had nine consecutive quarters of negative interstate migration. This means there are more people moving to the mainland than people moving here from the mainland, and that is a concern. It should be a concern for all of us.

Tasmania has some economic vulnerabilities. That is highlighted in the last report, too. Factors such as lower disposable incomes, higher unemployment rates and greater reliance and welfare benefits exacerbate the state's fiscal pressures.

The last report, given the time it was delivered, highlighted the impact of COVID-19. It said in that report that while the pandemic has had short-term effects, it has not fundamentally altered the long-term fiscal outlook. This government likes to talk about COVID a lot in terms of the trajectory of the budget, but we know it was not just the COVID measures that have turned the budget into the worst shape it has ever been in. There was a clear statement in the last report that spending for COVID-19 was not impacting the long-term fiscal outlook.

There was some outline in the last report implementing measures to control and optimise government spending, particular high-growth areas like health. There was strategic planning, developing long-term plans that address demographic challenges and economic challenges. It also talked about public engagement, involving the community in discussions about fiscal priorities and trade-offs. In that regard, Tasmanians are certainly waking up to the state of our finances.

Over the past 12 months or two years, many Tasmanians are starting to understand the shape of the budget. That has been helped with economic analysis. People like when it gets talked about a lot in this Chamber - Saul Eslake doing that review into the state's finances. Obviously, a lot of people took notice of that.

This is a pretty simple amendment. It will provide the parliament with some further work from Treasury, and some budget analysis by the end of the year. It will hold every government accountable on a four-year cycle, just like they should be. Arguably, it will be future governments that have to live by this and if I am fortunate to become a treasurer in a future government, I would be more than happy for this report to be produced every four years. I believe it is important to the economic discourse and the political debate that these reports are produced on a more regular basis so that we can all be informed about the decisions being taken on our behalf.

I am aware that there are members who want to make contributions. There may be amendments, I am not sure. I will wrap it up there. It is a fairly simple amendment. I did offer members an opportunity for a briefing if they required it. Thank you to the members who did reach out for a chat or a discussion.

I will take the opportunity at the end to sum up other people's contributions. This is nothing to worry about. It is a fairly simple amendment. The government will make their arguments. I am sure they probably do not have much of a problem with the four-yearly cycle. They may talk about resourcing, but I will make this point, before they have an opportunity, that you had Saul Eslake on his own do a comprehensive review of the state's finances in six months, including forward projections. Treasury has built these models. They have already done two of these reports. The government will try and tell you it will take nine months to produce one of these reports. That is not true. I have heard from within Treasury myself that it is about six months. It could easily be done this year with some more support. If Saul Eslake on his own can do a report like that in six months, I am sure the good people in Treasury can produce a report like this by the end of the year.

I will leave you with that because I am sure the government is going to do everything it can to scare members. It should not be like that, because this is a very simple amendment, and we can get it done.

[4.45 p.m.]
Mrs BESWICK (Braddon) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I rise to say that I am in agreement with this bill. When we first saw it, we noted the dates and times on it and being experienced in finances and organisations and businesses and knowing how long these things do take to put together, we did raise eyebrows basically saying, 'This year is probably a little bit too late.' We are currently sitting in the end of May. By the time this goes to the upper House and goes through, it is probably past financial year, it may not be until the next August sitting that it is even agreed to. Then we are telling them they have to have it done in a month.

I think that length of time is quite unreasonable. I totally agree that it needs to be every four years. I know that the Treasurer has intentions to move an amendment that basically puts it somewhere in between to make it more reasonable for this financial year or for the next financial year for Treasury to be able to start that cycle and put that in and make that appropriate.

Yes, I totally agree with the four years. I believe that the amendment the Treasurer is bringing forward is very reasonable and brings into consideration the organisational structure of treasury and what work they have to do. These are people; they are not just machines. We need to look after them. It has actually rather concerned me that Labor who supposedly supports the workers would not think that is important. I just thought I would put that out there.

Members interjecting.

Mr Willie - That is not a correct statement.

Mrs BESWICK - It may be more than possible, but I think we have to be realistic, and we have to be reasonable and these are staff, and these are people. It is not the government, it is not the minister yourself who is bringing that to the House.

Mr Willie - Yeah, but do not say we do not support workers.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order.

Mrs BESWICK - He is not writing the report himself, not like Saul Eslake. We do have to think about the work they have on.

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Members on my left will stop interjecting. Mrs Beswick, you might get less interjections if you address the Chair and not members to my left.

Mrs BESWICK - You had fun saying that. I commend the bill in general.

[4.45 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Treasurer) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I am very pleased to speak on this bill. First of all, I want to say thank you to the honourable member for Braddon for her remarks and in terms of particularly acknowledging Treasury officials. The first thing I want to say is thank you, thank you, thank you. Yes, it is budget day tomorrow, but the amount of work and effort that they have undertaken to prepare the Budget for tomorrow, to assist the government in its agenda to build a stronger economy, I have been amazed and very grateful and appreciative of the work of the Treasury officials.

I can tell you it is not just a few days or a few weeks. This is many, many months. In fact, it probably started the day after the last budget, 12 September last year. I just want to put that on the record on behalf of the government and myself in particular, sincere thank you, a debt of gratitude for their work to serve the government and the parliament, to support openness and transparency and the delivery of the budget for tomorrow.

I will share a few remarks. We are very supportive of openness and transparency and in terms of the Charter Budget Responsibility Act 2007, that is the aim of the act in 2007, to improve transparency and accountability in public sector financial management. 

It was in our first budget in 2014 - I arrived in 2014 with others in this place with our government at that time - the government announced its new fiscal strategy. That was based on several key long-term fiscal principles, the identification of strategic actions to be undertaken by the government to achieve those principles. As part of that action, the government committed to improving financial transparency and introduced a bill to amend the Charter of Budget Responsibility Act to assist in meeting this objective. It was our premier and our government that stated in the second reading for the Charter Budget Responsibility Bill 2015:

This government believes strongly in the establishment of fiscal principles that are designed to provide a strong financial foundation and be applicable across financial and economic cycles, and that these principles should have the interests of the Tasmanian community now and into the future at their core.

This was on the back of the Labor-Greens government, where the state was in recession with 10,000 jobs lost, and we were going backwards thick and fast. We were rebuilding the economy and this is consistent with exactly what we planned to do. There were six principles in terms of sound fiscal management and I will note them: to manage the state's finances responsibly for the wellbeing of all Tasmanians; to provide for the future for the next generation of Tasmanians; to prepare for unexpected events by building a robust financial position; to improve services to Tasmanians by building a strong economy and efficiently allocating public resources to gain the maximum community benefit; to formulate spending and taxation policies that ensure a reasonable degree of equity, stability and predictability; and to ensure transparency and accountability in developing, implementing and reporting on fiscal objectives.

Those principles have not changed. Tasmania's economy is strong - $40.6 billion strong. It is strong and it is growing, and we are pleased and proud of that. It is the strongest it has ever been. In fact, the gross state product has increased $8.9 billion or 26 per cent since we came to government in 2014. Unemployment rates are at the lowest level ever and, for the last several years, have been at record lows - 3.8 per cent was the last ABS statistic. I think colleagues would be aware of that; it is on the public record.

We have record high wage growth and record retail trade as well, and business confidence in Tasmania is, based on the NAB survey of the last several months now, at the highest in Australia. We are very pleased and proud of that. Of course, that goes up and down from time to time, but we are very pleased that businesses are confident about what we are doing in Tasmania and that we have got their back. We are backing business, we are backing industry and we are growing the economy. We want to keep it strong because it is essential to do that so that you can reinvest in those essential services like health and education.

Jo Palmer was there this morning outlining our plans for education. We are very pleased with that announcement backing in the importance of our literacy program and supporting infrastructure and upgrades to our schools. We have just been at the opening of the Brighton school and the Legana school not so long ago. It is really exciting to see. I was with Jacquie Petrusma last Sunday where we announced the health policy of nearly $10 million a day to meet the health demand. These are the things that we are focused on - the things that matter. We are building a better Tasmania now and for the future, and that is what you will see in the budget tomorrow.

Going back to the background to this particular bill, which was about Liberal government principles - it was drawn up in 2014 or 2015 and then subsequently amended even further by the Liberal government. In fact, it was Peter Gutwein as treasurer at the time who established the requirement for the five-yearly financial sustainability report on long-term sustainability of the state's finances. It was our initiative as a Liberal government. The report facilitates additional public reporting on the impact of current policy settings on future generations of Tasmanians, and provides an important long-term perspective on fiscal policy that is not currently captured by reporting on the budget in three years of forward Estimates. The fiscal sustainability report that has been referred to enables the Tasmanian community to better understand the future financial, economic, social and demographic environment in which the current state budget has been prepared.

That is the context in which this debate is happening today. It was our initiative as a Liberal government, and I support that wholeheartedly and entirely. If we can do better at any stage, in any way, shape or form, let us do it, and let us collaborate and work with goodwill to make it happen.

The Fiscal Sustainability Report is one mechanism to incorporate those considerations and the principles that I outlined earlier. The report also examines long-term physical sustainability under a number of different scenarios. The report takes considerable resources to produce and, and I again acknowledge the Treasury effort and impact. I appreciate Mrs Beswick, the Independent member for Braddon, and her remarks with respect to thanking those people involved. Making it every four years to every five years? I have absolutely no problem at all in supporting that, but it does take resources to prepare it and get it done.

The bill that we have before us, to cut to the quick - I am very supportive of the four years, omitting five years, but I note the second part talks about substituting 30 September for 30 June. There are two big problems with 30 September. The first problem is that it is only a few months away. We are talking four months - June, July, August and then September. The original sustainability report, I am advised, took up to nine months, but I am also advised it can take in and around four months or more to prepare a comprehensive fiscal sustainability report.

I am trying to be reasonable with the honourable proposer of this bill, and to foreshadow an amendment to make it the end of February next year. There are two benefits from that. First, you will give Treasury an adequate time to prepare a comprehensive report. Second, it will be based on the current information to 30 June this year. If you use the 30 September date as proposed by the shadow minister in the bill, you are actually focusing on last year's information, which will be dated. You will not have this year's information by 30 September. It is a physical impossibility.

As you probably know, the TAFR report comes out in October, and that is when you get all the updated information on the last financial year through to 30 June. I am just making the point we are trying to be reasonable. We are trying to be flexible. We want to be proactive, and as a treasurer, I absolutely want to be open and transparent, have the long-term targets, get the information - so, let us do it. Let us make it meaningful. You put it back to the end of February next year and I think you are on a winner. Then we can collaborate with goodwill. We can all hopefully agree on that. That is the amendment which I am foreshadowing that I will move in committee.

I have shared the principle of that with the member during the break and I am happy to have further discussions. If the member is happy to accept that, that is good. Otherwise, I will move that during the Committee stage.

Mr Willie - We have had a discussion. I have not seen it.

Mr BARNETT - I have circulated it, and I am happy to pass that to the member.

Mr Bayley - I have not.

Mr BARNETT - If other members in this place have seen it, perhaps they could pass one to the member for the Greens.

It is effectively replacing 30 September with 28 February. As I say, there are two main benefits. One is you give Treasury adequate time to get the job done in a comprehensive, professional, measured way. Secondly, it will be based on this year's up-to-date, current data through 30 June. If you lock in September, you are actually going to have the job. One, you will rush Treasury, but two, it will be based on last year's data. I am not sure why you would want to do that. It just seems really disappointing.

Mr Willie - That is how it is under existing legislation now - 30 June.

Mr BARNETT - It will be 30 June next year based on this year's data.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order. Mr Willie, you will have an opportunity to sum up.

Mr Willie - They have an outdated TAFR for that too.

Mr BARNETT - I am trying to be helpful and thoughtful. I am coming to this table with goodwill and support. Let us be very clear: this is something that we do support; openness and transparency. You will see more in the Budget tomorrow when I share the Budget in terms of responsibility and a fiscally sensible and a measured approach. There will certainly be further considerations being given to the motions that were put by the honourable member for Clark, Kristie Johnston and the honourable member for Franklin, David O'Byrne, a month or so ago, and obviously the Saul Eslake report, so watch this space. I will have more to say about that in due course.

We are trying to support the efforts and objectives of those in this place to make a difference. That is the long and short of it. Unfortunately, I am not sure if it is politically motivated that you are not willing to accept that, but that is your call.

Labor has belled the cat in terms of increasing taxes. That is what you are on about. We know your plan in terms of budget repair: you want to implement savage cuts and increased taxes. That is something we do not support. We do not support slash and burn. I will have more to say tomorrow during the delivery of the Budget speech. You will see that writ large there, which is a balanced approach. It will support our economy and back a strong economy and a growing economy. It will ensure that we focus on the things that matter like health, education, and the cost of living. It will deliver a pathway to surplus that I am very pleased about. I will have more to say in the Committee stage if that is required and I look forward to further discussions. Thank you.

[5.01 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to give my contribution to the member for Clark's bill, the Charter of Budget Responsibility Amendment Bill. I indicate upfront that we certainly support this. Bringing it in line with the electoral cycle or at least the term of government is sensible. I flag that we had concerns at the start about the deliverability of the September timeline. I will talk a little bit more about that. We are of a mind to support the amendment as foreshadowed by the Treasurer.

I start by articulating, of course, that we are looking forward to tomorrow's Budget. We fear it very deeply. We are already fielding a lot of calls and contact from community service organisations and others who are deeply concerned about their future and their ability to deliver the kind of services that they have, historically, the kind of services that Tasmanians need. They are really concerned about tomorrow's Budget and what it will mean in terms of the lack of funding that they have historically relied upon.

We are deeply concerned about the budget. The cat was really belled earlier in the year with Saul Eslake's report into the state's finances. He articulated that over the next three years, our budget is going to descend into being the worst in the country - that it is policy driving those decisions, it is policy that is driving that decay in the budget position and it is policy that is driving both the debt and the deficit position that this government is delivering. We are really concerned.

We are really concerned also with the backhanded way and the complete rejection that the government has given to that report - eminent economist, considered position, constructive recommendations, things like a parliamentary budget office, et cetera are just completely consigned to the shelf, it appears. We saw this year, in terms of the Revised Estimates Report, debt projections grow to $9.6 billion dollars by 2028. Mr Eslake has concerningly predicted that our debt levels may hit $16 billion by 2032, costing us $750 million every single year to service. We are on the precipice and we are facing a future where our children are going to inherit intergenerational debt, a level of debt that is completely unsustainable. This government has completely refused to entertain some of the suggestions about raising revenue, or some of the criticisms around its current strategies such as efficiency dividends, for example, or vacancy control being really lazy ways to try to restore the budget position.

We are concerned that the government operates in a bit of a vacuum and an echo chamber where it is just telling itself it is doing the right thing. It keeps telling itself it has got a pathway to surplus when that is apparent to absolutely nobody else. We are deeply concerned.

Needless to say, the stadium and the almost $2 billion of debt that the stadium will rack up and put onto our finances over the next 10 years in terms of both construction and operation is of deep concern. It is completely incongruous with the Labor Party's position to indicate and display a strong concern around the budget position but then write a blank cheque when it comes to the stadium, the level of public investment in the stadium and the level of public debt that is going to get wrapped up in terms of the stadium.

I really do not need to say a lot about this bill. Reducing the five-year window or timeframe to four makes sense because, as has been articulated, that brings it in line with the term of government - assuming a government goes full-term, that is. That means that each government that does go full-term will be compelled to author and publish one of these fiscal sustainability reports. We absolutely support that and welcome the fact that the Treasurer supports that as well.

On changing 30 June to 30 September, I will echo Mrs Beswick's concerns that were raised. We had identified in our head the fact that that was potentially an untenable timeline to expect the Treasury to deliver on, notwithstanding Mr Eslake's rapid delivery of a review of the state's finances and notwithstanding the fact that Treasury is well-resourced. We were concerned and were of a mind ourselves to propose an amendment to push it out towards the end of the year or into the next year. Two months to publish this kind of fiscal sustainability report really does seem kind of untenable and an unreasonable expectation to place on Treasury officials.

With that, I signal here and now that given that the four-year timeframe is going to stay, and this government or any government going forward will ultimately be compelled to deliver one every four years - that we would probably prefer it to be a little bit earlier than the end of February - but we would be willing to support the Treasurer's proposed amendment about pushing this next report out until the end of February. We will get a level of transparency there. That will be a good five or six months or so ahead of when it would otherwise have been delivered. I think it is a fair and reasonable timeframe for Treasury officials to do this kind of work and make sure that they do it properly. 
[5.09 p.m.]
Mr WILLIE - Deputy Speaker, I thank members for their contributions. We will just indicate that the Greens sound like they were going to amend my amendment bill for a report this year still. We can still do that. We can have that debate when the Treasurer moves his amendment.

The Treasurer in his contribution talked about the Liberals coming to power in 2014 and setting up the Charter of Budget Responsibility, and about fiscal principles. I guess if you look back then, electorally, some people in the community saw that they may have had some credibility in terms of managing the budget and the economy, but those days are long gone. This is a government that has completely trashed any credibility they had managing the budget or the economy, and the state's finances have never been worse. That is the feedback I get in the community these days: that this government has fallen a long way from the fiscal discipline and the way that they tried to manage the budget in those early days.

Yes, the Charter of Budget Responsibility was a positive. There are some good things in that around managing the state's finances. Have they abided by that in their 11 years in government? No, they have not. We have the biggest debt in the state's history. We have had some of the biggest deficits ever delivered in the state's history in the last couple of years. We have a premier railing against another bill that I have introduced to the House because he wants to continue those record deficits. The threshold is pretty high, and the fact that he is concerned about that threshold and wants to keep spending unchecked sends a pretty clear message that he wants to keep doing what he is doing, which is not in Tasmania's interest.

The Treasurer also said that he had advice that Treasury could do this report within four months at a minimum. He made some arguments around the TAFR. I will point out to other members that under current legislation the fiscal sustainability report that is delivered on 30 June is actually done with an outdated TAFR anyway. It will be from this year when they deliver that report next year, so I would not use that argument for your decision-making.

The other thing I will point out to members of the House is they actually developed the Budget without the TAFR actuals, so you need to put that argument to a side. Yes, perhaps there are some reasonable arguments in terms of resourcing from Treasury. I was told that Treasury could buy in some help if they had to deliver it on 30 September, if it did pass the parliament, but perhaps during the debate, when we get there, we could entertain another date later in the year - maybe 30 October or 30 November. We would get this report this year so we could use that to scrutinise this government in the wake of their budget delivery, and I think that would be reasonable. The Treasurer himself has admitted that Treasury could do that, so we could have a go at that.

The Greens raised the stadium. In previous debates I have pointed out - and we are getting way off topic here - that if you understood the stadium and how that is allocated in the budget, you are talking about a small percentage of the infrastructure budget, one-off capital funding. The structural problems with the Tasmanian budget are far greater than one infrastructure project. If people think you can cancel one infrastructure project and that will fix our budget woes, they are mistaken. A lot of those deficits, the record debt, is all going to continue whether you cancel that stadium or not.

Bringing the stadium into fiscal debates -

Mrs Pentland - It is a billion dollars on top. It is a lot.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order.

Mr WILLIE - No, it is not. This is another misunderstanding.

Members interjecting.

Mrs Pentland - Minus $240 million.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order.

Mr WILLIE - You actually voted for the Budget. Macquarie Point Development Corporation has over $600 million for the stadium now. You voted for that; you know that. You are not talking about a huge deterioration in the bottom line. People are saying, 'It is going to add a billion dollars to the bottom line.' It is not. You have already supported most of the funding; it is already with the Macquarie Point Development Corporation.

Anyway, we are getting off topic. I am happy to hear the Treasurer's arguments about the date, but I believe that we could get a report this year. He has admitted himself that Treasury could do this within four months. We could look at a date a little bit later in the year. I would be happy to compromise there, and that would be somewhere between what the government is saying and what is originally proposed.


CHARTER OF BUDGET RESPONSIBILITYAMENDMENT BILL 2025 (No. 23)

In Committee

Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to.

Clause 4 -
Schedule 1 amended

[5.15 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT - I confirm what I foreshadowed earlier: an amendment to clause 4, which reads:

Leave out paragraph (b) 

Insert instead 

(b)	in clause 14A(3), by omitting the words '30 June' where secondly occurring, and substituting in '28 February'.

If anybody needs another copy of that, please sing out. There are two main reasons for the amendment. One is that you provide enough time for Treasury to undertake a comprehensive assessment and effort to deliver a report which is going to be very useful and meaningful for members of parliament and members of the public alike. The date 30 September is totally unsatisfactory. We are literally on budget day tomorrow and then we go through a budget debate, obviously, in coming weeks, and hopefully by the end of June we get through the budget session, all being well - 26 June. It is totally unacceptable and ridiculous to even suggest it.

That is why the suggestion is there and there are two reasons: one is that you have to provide Treasury and Treasury officials adequate time to do a comprehensive job so that members of parliament can then benefit from it. Second, if it is 28 February, you are then allowing Treasury to review the updated financial figures to 30 June of this year. Those figures are provided by Treasury at the end of October every year. It happens every year, the TAFR report, and that TAFR report is a summary of all the income expenses, everything that has happened for the last 12 months through 30 June of that year.

That report is delivered at the end of October, so I have tried to be reasonable and sensible. Let us say you get that information and it is there in the public arena for all to see. Treasury can then start that work as quickly as possible at the end of October, and then have November, December, January and February to deliver a very meaningful, comprehensive report on the latest information. If you do anything prior to that, even December, you will be doing it on last year's report, the TAFR report from October last year.

You might argue that because the financial sustainability strategy is a long-term strategy, it does not really matter - I think it does. Surely you want the latest information to provide useful, meaningful advice and feedback? We are about to bring down the Budget tomorrow, which I am really looking forward to because it is going to be something that will deliver what is important. It will build a better Tasmania now and for the future, investing in the things that matter, like health, education, and community safety.

I will not take up too much time. I think it is pretty simple. I have put forward that amendment. I think it is a very sensible one and they are the two main reasons: provide up-to-date information on the latest financials and giving Treasury officials adequate time to get the job done. I put the amendment.

Mr WILLIE - Thank you, Chair. I do not support the amendment. I think that there is a compromise here. Disregard the Treasurer's argument around the TAFR, under legislation at the moment, this Fiscal Sustainability Report is actually delivered with a TAFR actual from the year before anyway. We are talking about long-term projections here and a whole lot of data sets that go into this report. To try and make an argument around one set of actuals making this massive difference, you need to put that aside.

However, there is a compromise position here and, if possible, I am going to try and amend the Treasurer's amendment. It is an amendment to the amendment to clause 4:

Leave out paragraph (b)

Insert instead 

'(b)	in clause 14A(3) by omitting the words '28th February' where secondly occurring, and substituting in '30 November'.'

The Treasurer has outlined that Treasury actually has the resources and could deliver the report by 30 November this year. It keeps up the flow of information. We are about to have a budget delivered. It is probably going to have a deteriorating net debt figure, and we need to continue scrutiny and the flow of information.

This will allow for this report to be delivered this year. The Treasurer himself said minimum four months; this would give more like six months, which from my understanding is what Treasury needs to deliver this report. This is a compromise position between the government and my original proposal, and I hope that members are able to support it.

Mr BARNETT - Can I just speak on the amendment to the amendment? You have been very picky now because you are doing this based on last year's information, correct?

Mr Willie - I have made that argument.

Mr BARNETT - I know, so why do you want to do it for the sake of three months to get the latest information for everybody in this place to be able to provide a measured, sensible, comprehensive report and everybody will have the updated information. That is why the February date is the sensible one. Your date compromises the outcome because you are doing it based on last year's financials.

That is a matter for you. You have moved that amendment. Clearly you believed that your first proposed 30 September date is ridiculous, which it is.

Mr Winter - That is not what he said. That is ridiculous, what you just said.

Mr BARNETT - You could absolutely say so. It is very unfair on Treasury officials, very unfair, and you should be aware of that.

Mr Winter - You know what? You are worried about yourself. That is who you are worried about.

Mr BARNETT - The Leader of the Opposition should be very aware, with your background in Treasury, of the amount of time and effort they put into these things. I will pick you up on that with your history and background.

Mr Winter - You are worried about yourself. Do not use them as a human shield for you. This is about you.

Mr BARNETT - You missed the first part of the debate where that was made a very important point, and that is thank you to the Treasury officials for all their work.

Mr Winter - Yes, and now you are using them as a human shield to protect yourself. Do not do this. It is terrible, what you do.

Mr BARNETT - I made that point at great length in my opening remarks, for which you were not here. I do not need to say too much more. If you go ahead with that date and you support that, you are not getting the latest information.

Mr Willie - One set of actuals is not going to make a difference. I made that argument.
Mr BARNETT - I think it is a very poor assessment. That is the point that should be made. If you want the latest information, three months and you will have the latest information.

Mrs PENTLAND - I am confused. To clarify, if we have 30 November, it is going to be a report on last financial year's data?

Mr Barnett - Correct.

Mrs PENTLAND - Because there is no way you could produce this financial year's data by 30 November, and if it is 28 February, then it will be this financial year's data.

Mr Barnett - Correct.

Mrs PENTLAND - Thank you. I would very much like 28 February then, because I can see why it would be important to have this financial year rather than last financial year.

Mr BAYLEY - Thank you, Chair. Let me just pick up the Treasurer. I am not in the business of defending Labor, but I have to say, labelling their first date as an acknowledgement that it was ridiculous I think is a pretty unfair and unreasonable thing to do.

The member has acknowledged that this is a compromise position between what he first put on the table and what you have put on the table. It is fairly and squarely in the middle there. You do you, I will just say that. That is a pretty unfair way to characterise a member here coming into this place trying to come to a compromise position.

From our perspective, we would be willing to support this amendment to the amendment. We did have in mind the end of the year, 30 November, as a date that could be a target. I hear the arguments about it not having the most up-to-date information and, in some ways, I get that. I do understand that, but at the same time, these are 15-year projections. This is a long-term analysis of the state's finances. This is trying to paint - that happens every four years now assuming this gets up. I think it is not necessarily all that significant that the exact year's data are available but having the data for the year before is sufficient to be able to point to the long-term trends for the fiscal position and be able to do an analysis regarding fiscal sustainability.

I do not think that is a significant argument. I am persuaded by the shadow treasurer in the argument he has made about the data that would be on the record at that time being sufficient to inform this report going forward.

We would be willing to support the amendment to the amendment. That is imminently deliverable by Treasury staff and acceptable in terms of the data that is on the table at that time.

Mr WILLIE - For clarity, I want to make the point that the Treasurer is making this argument around one set of actuals. One set of actuals is not going to make a huge difference to the projections over the 15-year period. They look at the actuals back to 2021. This argument that you have one set of actuals is going to make this huge difference to this report -

Mr Winter - Exactly, what is he saying about his estimates?

Mr WILLIE - Yes, exactly. It is a straw man argument. They prepare a budget without the actuals for the current financial year. He is using this to try to bamboozle people. Under the current legislation when the Fiscal Sustainability Report (FSR) is delivered next year on 30 June, it is from the actuals from the year before. Under the current legislation, that is what happens.

The Treasurer is trying to confuse people here by trying to prevent the flow of information. You need to weigh up whether one set of actuals in the context of the whole report is going to make a huge difference versus the continual flow of information. We are about to have the Budget; I think this report is really important by the end of the year to continue to hold this government to account for the trajectory of the state's finances.

You need to weigh up the argument that the Treasurer is making versus the continual flow of information. Under the current legislation, they use the actuals from the year before. He is trying to introduce this new idea to confuse members. 

Mr FERGUSON - Chair, I rise to speak about the matters contained in the amendment. I was amazed at how quickly the debate wound up in the second reading stage of this bill. It seems that that may be in part because, in principle, which has now been dealt with, the House is largely in favour.

I wonder why it is that the opposition is not prepared to see reason and good sense on the date. If the House is satisfied with a four-year maximum period between fiscal sustainability reports, why are they sticking in the mud regarding the date? What the Treasurer has proposed makes perfect sense. You actually have a Treasurer here who is prepared to collaborate and find common ground on an area of importance that has been raised by the opposition. Speaking for myself, I share the Treasurer's and the opposition's interest in budget sustainability, and so should we all. However, it has to work for our Treasury officials. It has to be functional and fit for purpose.

What the Treasurer has brought forward is a fair-minded amendment that helps Mr Willie and Mr Winter make their bill work in practice. It is the case, and the Treasurer, if I understand him right, has represented the timeframes that are needed by the Treasury staff to do a fiscal sustainability review. It is a big undertaking. I know that to be the case. It is an important piece of work, and it cannot be arbitrarily rushed or pushed into a timeframe that is not feasible.

When the next FSR is done, I hope that the opposition want it to be based on the latest data, the best evidence, the latest set of accounts; I would want that. I heard Mr Willie earlier dreaming about being a treasurer one day. Well, he may well wish to be that treasurer, but would he not want, whenever Treasury does its FSR, to be basing it on the best and latest information? I would hope so. I would invite the opposition to swallow its pride, accept that they have been able to collaborate with the government and the crossbench on the principle, which is that we will have FSRs done a little bit earlier each time - a marginal change, I have to add, from five years to four. If we can agree on that - and we can - then let us also agree on being fair-minded and pragmatic in respect of the workflow as it occurs through a calendar and financial year for treasury officials. It is a big piece of work.

It is a substantial effort and by changing out the words 'proposed by the opposition' and instead referring to 'February', it is based on feedback from the very people who will be charged with this work. I hope that the opposition could take some of the politics out of this. We all care about the budget. I believe that to be the case. I question it when I think about the extraordinary election promises that were made by the opposition which outgunned the Liberals by a multiple, let us put it that way, and spent billions more in the election. I digress.

I think we are all interested in budget sustainability, and we all accept that the budget does need to see some improvement. We all accept that, everybody. By the way, every state except Western Australia accepts that fact. The nation's finances have been challenged. Every state's finances have been challenged, except, of course, for Western Australia, which got the royal treatment on the GST -

Mr Winter - From whom? Your government. 

Mr FERGUSON - but I do commend this amendment. I have dealt with you in the past on that matter and you have been wrong because we did not agree to the change in formula -

Mr Winter - You did. I will bring it out again if you like.

Mr FERGUSON - No, Mr Winter, you are again misleading this House. I commend the Treasurer and the amendment that is before the Chair.

Mr Willie - That is my amendment to the amendment.

Mr FERGUSON - It makes sense to me. It makes sense to Treasury and the people who will be charged with the work. I congratulate the Treasurer for the work that he has been doing in the role.

Ms Dow - It is our motion. It is our bill.

Mr FERGUSON - The question before the Chair is the amendment.

Mr Bayley - Amended amendment.

Mr Willie - The amendment to the amendment - that I put.

Mr FERGUSON - I commend the Treasurer's amendment.

Mr Willie - Do you commend the amendment before the House?

Mr FERGUSON - I will show the grace you have not. I accept that and I apologise. I commend the Treasurer's amendment. It should not be vandalised. It is about making good sense and the best and productive use of the time of our valued public servants, so that this is a useful exercise and an informative one so that the Fiscal Sustainability Report, when it is next done, does not serve as an instrument for just more politicking, but to help public policymakers of both Houses to make informed decisions about the long-term health of the state's finances.

We are not referring to the next one, two, three or four years. We are not even talking about the next 10 years. We are talking about the next 20 years - a long-term trajectory of the state's finances and for all of us to have made a contribution, a positive one, without the usual invective of party politics. For us to have made a contribution to progressively improve the state's finances; to ensure that while meeting the responsibilities of government and helping government to meet the needs that the community tell us that they have, in health and in cost of living and in housing, and the many challenges that they face; that we can meet those responsibilities but in the longer sense, in the broader sense of planning finances in years to come, that we have had a nonpartisan lens of progressively improving the state's finances.

I know that the government continues to be committed to the fiscal strategy - an important way again to take the politics out of budgeting and set a lens of not four years, but 10 years, out to make sure that we actually have some guideposts for future fiscal sustainability.

I commend the Treasurer for his work here and commend the amendment that the Treasurer has put before the House this afternoon.

I again take that final opportunity to refute again the opposition's false claims on GST, the false claim regarding the state government agreeing to the changing formula for HFE changes in this country. I look forward to the Productivity Commission review of that deal. I hope that all parties - noting that in Canberra it is Labor that is in power and in this state it is the Liberals - will put the national interest ahead of an individual interest in this. I hope that the state treasurers of all parties, because there are plenty of Liberal and Labor treasurers at the states when they meet, will work together for the national interest, not for a single interest, and to combine and do what is best for our country. I suspect what will be best for our country is one of a perpetual 'no worse off' guarantee or returning to the original formula.

The changed formula was devised by Labor's Chris Bowen, the opposition shadow treasurer at the time, and implemented by the - 

Mr Willie - By the government.

Mr FERGUSON - Morrison and Turnbull government with a unanimous vote in the federal parliament, Mr Willie, but Tasmania did not sign up to that deal. Mr Gutwein has been clear about that and I repeat it today. What we sought was the 'no worse off' guarantee. 

I commend the Treasurer's amendment.

[5.37 p.m.]
Mr WINTER - Chair, I have to respond to some of that. This is not a debate about the GST, but I cannot let that go without comment. In the very brief period of time I had to find the comments from the former premier and then treasurer, Peter Gutwein, I did find a statement on 16 October 2018.

The Tasmanian Government welcomes the Commonwealth Government's guarantee announcement there will be a legislative 'no worse off' guarantee in the proposed GST distribution legislation. We will review the Commonwealth's latest proposal and subsequent legislation before making further comment.

A 'no worse off' guarantee would ensure only upside for Tasmania going forward, regardless of whether economic conditions change. The new distribution model put forward by the Commonwealth based on its modelling would leave Tasmania $112 million better-off through 2026-27.

Chair, that is the support that was provided at the time, the political cover that was provided by Peter Gutwein, by this government, by members of this government for that deal. 

There he goes. He walks out of the Chamber - the person who said earlier that he cares. We all care about the budget.

The political cover for the GST deal was provided by the Tasmanian Liberal government, the government that had the most to lose from this deal. They let the federal Morrison government roll over Tasmania and signed us up to this deal where we now require the 'no worse off' guarantee to be renewed over and over. The political cover was given by this government, and Tasmanian Labor never buckled, not once. We stood firm against this. It is here, and it is going to continue to repeatedly create tension in the budget for a long time.

The former treasurer who had to get up, basically, to make the arguments for the current Treasurer who cannot make the economic arguments he would like to, said in his contribution, 'We all care about the budget'. He talked about progressively improving our finances, if you could believe it. This is a government that has not been progressively improving our finances. It is on a pathway to $10 billion of net debt, and tomorrow we find out that it has probably become even worse. We had the former treasurer, who delivered a $1.5 billion deficit, and the new Treasurer, who is on track to a $1.3 billion deficit. There is no treasurer in history that has delivered deficits anything like this. If this were a Labor government producing budgets like this, you would be carrying on like pork chops. You would be going absolutely spare about the level of debt and deficit. However, it is the Liberal Party that is doing it.

Today the government has taken the approach of trying to build a straw man around the shadow treasurer's arguments, claiming that he backed down when he is purely trying to find a compromise position on this amendment. The amendment actually puts some teeth to the bill. What the Treasurer has put up in his amendment does not give us very much at all. In fact, it is not enough for this House. If this House wants to provide that level of transparency around what they are up to, it must support Mr Willie's amendments because we need to keep constant supervision on this Treasurer. The supervision cannot just be tomorrow or next week or in Estimates. It needs to be constant and relentless. We must keep a close eye on this Treasurer and what he is up to. 

The former treasurer wrecked the budget and this Treasurer is only carrying on with the same approach. They have no plan. They have given up on fixing Tasmania's budget. They gave up a long time ago. They made a decision that the best thing for them to do is just keep going on the way it is. The Premier says 'Just plough on, just plough on.'

It is frightening what this Budget looks like and why I am deeply concerned about what tomorrow's Budget will bring, what it brings for our nurses. We have already seen the cuts and freezes to public sector jobs through the announcement made only a few months ago. They said there would be no attacks on frontline services, then their own document comes out and says there are two nursing positions going; librarians; park rangers -

Mrs Petrusma - They were not going. They were new positions of Assistants in Nursing (AINs). There are 3100 new health workers in the healthcare system - over 1000 new nurses. 

Mr WINTER - Hang on: they were not going? So, the positions the Treasurer - 

Mrs Petrusma - No, they were positions that were not part of the establishment.

Mr WINTER - Hang on a second, we have an interjection from the Minister for Health, who has decided to interject into this. I want to make sure that is picked up in Hansard because the order of the House, if I recall correctly, Mr Willie, was that the Treasurer was to provide members of this place with a list of those positions they were freezing and the job titles. He provided two titles that sounded very much like nurses, one a Level 3 registered nurse. Now - 

DEPUTY CHAIR - I will bring you back to the point of relevance of the date, please.

Mr WINTER - Sure, quite right, Chair. This House needs to make sure we can hold the government to account so that we can make sure they are not freezing the roles of nurses, as the Treasurer informed the House over the break when he provided that information. We need to make sure we are holding them to account so they cannot freeze the jobs of park rangers, or of librarians. The information provided to the House said they were doing exactly that. It was not denied at the time.

The Minister for Health now says that perhaps the positions never existed at all, which makes you wonder why they tabled the document. Whether the information provided by the Treasurer was accurate and true is unclear at the moment. What we do know is this government needs constant supervision. The date needs to be amended in line with Mr Willie's amendment because we need to make sure we get this information this year. We have a budget tomorrow; we need constant supervision of this government and, later this year, we need to make sure we have a handle on their long-term forecasts. That means supporting the amendment.

Mr O'BYRNE - Chair, it seems to me that we are in furious agreement that there needs to be relentless focus on the budget. The member who is about to resume his seat said we need to maintain it as if this is the only document that maintains that kind of attention on it. We get the Revised Estimates Reports, we get the budget, we get a whole lot of other reports. This is one of many reports we are seeing. The merit behind Mr Willie's bill here today is accepted. I support the underlying principles and, it seems to me, based on what I have heard today, that the Treasurer has agreed with you.

What we are arguing now is about a couple of months. At the end of the day, I feel the Treasurer has accepted the premise of your bill, that these reports need to be more frequent, given the will of the House is demanding it. We are arguing about a couple of months. To me, a December or a February or a November, given the Christmas period, is neither here nor there. I accept the Treasurer's arguments that the information in February will be far more contemporary for the reports we receive. It is a matter of months. He has accepted the premise of your argument and I accept his arguments. Therefore, I will not be supporting the amendment to the amendment, but I will be supporting the original amendment.

Mr BEHRAKIS - Chair, I was not planning on speaking about this but, getting back to what we are actually debating here - the timelines, it was said that if we accept the amendment to the amendment, then we will be using actuals from the last financial year. I think it was Mr Bayley who argued - I do not want to put words in anyone's mouth - that we are talking about 15-year projections, so what is the downside of using last financial year's actuals? The same argument, I would think, would apply as well. If you are talking about 15-year projections and long-term focus, what difference does a couple of months make? If we are publishing this kind of information, and as Mr O'Byrne said, we agree with the principle of this bill, would we not want to be making sure that the data published is based on information that is accurate at the time of being published?

A lot can change in six months. Look at what happened in 2020. Would it not be of consequential importance to make sure that the information we are relying on to scrutinise the budget is accurate at the time of publishing, not six months old at the time of publishing? If there is an answer to that question, I would be happy to hear it. Otherwise, I will be supporting the Treasurer's amendment and not the amendment to the amendment for that reason.

Mr WILLIE - I will have one last say.

Mr O'Byrne - I do not think it will be your last in this House, mate.

Mr WILLIE - That is probably a good thing. What happens under current legislation is the Fiscal Sustainability Report is delivered on the previous actuals in the previous year. It is what happens under legislation now. This is a straw man argument to say that one set of actuals is going to make a massive difference to the projections of this report. It is not going to make a huge difference. You have to weigh this up. It happens under existing legislation already, and you have to weigh this up against the flow of information. We are about to have a budget that is probably deep in the red, going further into the red tomorrow. There are going to be a lot of members with a lot of things to say about that. Getting a report like this by the end of the year will assist us in holding this government to account.

We need to weigh up the flow of information versus this argument that the Treasurer is trying to confuse people with, which has no substance. Under existing legislation, this is what happens now. The Treasurer himself has said this is deliverable by 30 November. Earlier in the debate he said four months minimum. This would give them at least six. Well, not quite six. However, it is doable for Treasury to do this at this date. It is a compromise position; I think it is very reasonable. I am going to put the amendment to the amendment.

DEPUTY CHAIR (Mrs Beswick) - The question is -

That the amendment to the amendment be agreed to.

MOTION

Macquarie Point Stadium - AFL Deal Renegotiation

[5.59 p.m.]
Mrs PENTLAND (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, a vote will be required. I move -

That the House -

Acknowledges the deep and growing community division over the Macquarie Point Stadium proposal. 

Notes the findings of recent polling commissioned by the Federal Group which shows a clear majority of Tasmanians: 

believe the AFL has treated our state unfairly; 

oppose the Government exceeding its $375 million spending cap; and 

do not support the removal of the stadium from the Project of State Significance process. 
Recognises that the current stadium agreement exposes Tasmanian taxpayers to financial risk and that much more is known about the project than when Prime Minister Hon. Anthony Albanese MP committed $240 million in April 2023. 

Further notes concerns raised by Cricket Tasmania and Cricket Australia regarding the stadium's suitability for hosting cricket remains unresolved. 

(5)	Calls on the State Government to immediately facilitate a joint meeting with the AFL, Cricket Australia, and the Federal Labor Government to address the concerns held by Tasmanians, including the timeline and planning process associated with the project, and explore ways to lessen the financial burden on Tasmanians. 

I welcome the opportunity to move this motion today, calling on the state government to re-engage with both the AFL and federal Labor on the Macquarie Point Stadium.

Off the back of the federal election, with Tasmania now home to an increased number of government members, there is a golden opportunity to discuss the Macquarie Point project and the requirements contained in the AFL deal. What I am putting forward is in no way prevented by the fact that the government has released its new legislation. In fact, it is an appropriate time for the federal government to re-engage.

More than two years ago, in April 2023, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese effectively fired the starter's gun on the stadium by committing $240 million to the broader project. I say broader project because the Prime Minister and his federal colleagues focused on an urban development, including port upgrades and housing. Because the state government had made it clear that the project's future relied on the federal funding, the Prime Minister was acutely aware he was effectively giving the stadium the green light.

Since that point, federal Labor has been virtually silent on the stadium, leaving advocacy for the project to others. I do not say this to shift responsibility away from the state government, but federal Labor has a responsibility to play a more effective role in an issue that is clearly causing a lot of division in our community.

No doubt all four successful lower House Labor candidates - Anne Urquhart, Jess Teesdale, Rebecca White and Julie Collins - would have heard a host of opinions about the stadium whilst campaigning. They would have also been aware of how divisive the debate has become and the anxiety in the community about what the cost and debt will mean for future generations. While it is politically smart to let state Liberals wear the criticism, the key role federal Labor played at the start of the project is reason enough to show leadership on the issue.

Much has happened since the funding announcement in April 2023. The licence was granted just a few days later, kicking off a dramatic series of events that have led us to this moment we face here today. The estimated cost has changed dramatically, going from $715 million to $945 million before the contract has even been drawn up. I note that there is a contingency built into the current estimate, but we know how easily big projects can go over budget.

We know Macquarie Point poses significant challenges from a construction point of view, so putting downward pressure on costs will be almost impossible. There have been independent reports highlighting both the benefits and risk of the project.
While the Tasmanian Planning Commission has identified a long list of issues that must be addressed for the stadium to go ahead, we also know far more about public sentiment when it comes to the stadium. Multiple polls have shown a majority of Tasmanians do not support the current proposal, despite broad support for the club itself. Many Tasmanians simply feel like they are not being heard. The government's 'Everything is going to be fine' attitude, coupled with the constant shifting of the goal posts has created uncertainty and mistrust.

Significantly, policy changes when it comes to both how the project is going to be assessed and paid for has fuelled opposition. Recent polling, specifically on the stadium and general voter sentiment, shows the government has a big problem on its hands.

There is considerable discontent with the way the Labor opposition has approached the issue. I do not need to rehash how significantly Labor's position has changed, but the major party unity ticket is not seen as healthy. With that in mind, I believe this motion presents Labor an opportunity to acknowledge the public's misgivings about the project and that a lot needs to change to win back trust.

Labor is obviously also in a unique position to encourage its federal colleagues to become more actively involved. After all, MPs on that side of the House could one day be ministers grappling with the massive consequences of the deal we signed up to.

I am sure we are about to hear why the deal cannot be renegotiated. Although I deliberately use the word 're-engage' in this motion, I would like to contest the idea that a deal is set in stone. Agreements change all the time. Alterations are made to reflect new information or different circumstances. This idea that a deal struck more than two years ago cannot be re-examined is very difficult for the public to swallow.

The government has changed its own path forward multiple times, making sweeping changes to the funding model and the way the project is to be assessed - so why is it implausible to suggest the two governments and the AFL should sit down and take stock of the situation? No one is saying the whole thing should be torn up and started again. A mature conversation needs to occur to see if the conditions attached to Tasmania AFL licence can more closely align with the views of taxpayers who are largely paying for this to happen. It is not unreasonable to ask this. At least at the very least it would send a message to Tasmanians that political and sporting leaders, who they are relying on, are willing to listen.

There will be some who say the prospect of re-engaging will be a risk to the club and our chance of joining the AFL and the AFLW. The biggest risk to the Devils is this government continuing its trajectory that is, and has had, diminishing support.

Something needs to change and give Tasmanians hope that we are not on a path to a disaster. I firmly believe the federal government and AFL can play a vital role in restoring confidence. Cricket should also have a seat at the table. The doubt over whether matches can be played in daylight hours needs to be immediately addressed. If we are going to build a stadium, cricket has a vital role in making it come even closer to stacking up.

It is not about dollars and cents, but I have argued all along that the deal as it stands exposes Tasmanians to far too much financial risk. We do not have to look far to be reminded that big infrastructure projects can get out of hand. Upgrading Geelong's port infrastructure to accommodate the Spirits, which was finished in 2022, cost $61 million - compare that to a similar port development in Devonport, which is now going to cost $493 million, a long way from the original estimate of $90 million.

Tasmanians are rightly nervous about what the final bill will be. We already have a very serious net debt problem, which Saul Eslake estimates could exceed $16 billion by 2035. I am not demanding the federal government invest more money, but given its initial contributions started the ball rolling, I believe it should at least consider ways to reduce the financial risk to Tasmanians. If our debt situation impacts our ability to pay for essentials like schools and hospitals, the feds will end up paying for it one way or another anyway.

While I remain deeply sceptical over whether Tasmania can afford this stadium, I am determined to play a constructive role in this debate. The motion can be stepped forward to a more unified state, a mature considered conversation about the challenges this project has presented us and the risk associated - the risk both to the state's long-term financial health, but also the risk associated with the project failing.

I listened to the Devils' general manager Kath McCann's passionate contribution to the recent ABC debate. I hear her when she talks about the need for the team to be commercially viable from the beginning and the role the new infrastructure plays in guaranteeing that. I know that without a commitment to new infrastructure, the AFL and in particular the club presidents are likely to lose patience. That is not a reason for the state government to push ahead as if nothing is wrong.

Where is the harm in sitting down with the AFL, Cricket Australia, and the Australian Government to take stock of the project and acknowledge why so many Tasmanians remain opposed? What can be done to address those legitimate concerns? We cannot continue on the path we are on. Sadly, that is a recipe for even more division at a time when we desperately need to be united. I implore the House to support the motion, and I urge the major parties to listen to the Tasmanian people and acknowledge their legitimate concerns.

[6.09 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for Bass for bringing this motion forward to allow us to further ventilate aspects of the stadium, which will be the transformative infrastructure project for our state, allowing for cultural events, conventions of up to 1500 people and a sporting facility for the AFL.

As the multipurpose stadium, it will serve many useful purposes, but like with any major infrastructure project, be it a shopping centre development or an office block development, before you go ahead with it, you would nearly always want an anchor tenant. For the multipurpose stadium it would be fair to say that the anchor tenant is the AFL, and that is what makes the stadium proposal stack up.

In relation to the various clauses of the motion, I would make the following points. Whilst there is community division in relation to this, whether it is deep and growing I do not know. What I do know is that there are 210,000 people now signed up to the Tassie Devils team, and I would like to think that the vast bulk of them know and acknowledge that you cannot have a Tassie Devils team without the stadium.

They need to know that that is the fact. Whether we like it or not, that is the fact. Why do we need a stadium? We do not only have to rely on Brendon Gale and AFL officials. It was our very own Tasmanian-grown taskforce in 2018 led by Brett Godfrey that said that for a successful team, initially let them play in a bit of a revamped York Park or now UTAS Stadium whilst developing a fully-fledged stadium in the Hobart CBD along the Adelaide model. That is what we as Tasmanians said through our taskforce all those years ago.

Our Tasmanian taskforce recognised that if we wanted to be in the big league with our own team, we needed a brand new stadium. As a government, we see the opportunity of that to link in other infrastructure to enable cultural events and, as I said before, conferences where we can entice people from not only around Australia but around the world.

I also know that from time to time there is community division, but I would like to think that above it all, the things that unite us are a lot stronger than the things that divide us. Strong leadership requires making the tough calls, and that is what the Premier has done.

I reflect on Australian politics. When Paul Keating floated the Australian dollar it was highly unpopular, and if you were to have a referendum on it at the time, I am sure it would have been defeated, but it was the right call, and nobody regrets that decision today.

Similarly, on the other side of politics, when John Howard pursued the goods and services tax - a fundamental tax reform - the scare campaigns against it were nonstop. It was going to be Armageddon, it was going to be the collapse of the Australian economy, it would be an existential threat to every single household in Australia, you name it. We got it through. Three years later, the government was re-elected with an increased majority.

Sometimes there are issues that confront a state or a nation that might be unpopular but require the sort of firm leadership the Premier is providing to this debate. Then, after a while, people say, 'What was all that about?' In relation to the stadium, I am heartened by the fact that that is exactly what happened in Townsville, in Adelaide, in Perth, in relation to stadiums. It also happened in Victoria in relation to Federation Square; huge demonstrations against a waste of money, et cetera, and now the people in those cities are saying, 'What was all the fuss about and what a good thing that the leadership at the time allowed it to proceed.' The Liberal opposition leader in Victoria opportunistically opposed Federation Square. The Liberal opposition, it might have been, in South Australia similarly opposed the Adelaide Oval. However, now you will not have anybody opposed to it and who is one of the strongest advocates for Tasmania to have a team, but former Liberal premier of South Australia, John Olsen.

He knows how transformative it has been for Adelaide and he knows how good it will be for Tasmania. Clause 2(a) talks about beliefs that the AFL has treated our state unfairly and that feeds into the advertisement that I have seen recently that asserts that the AFL is bullying Tasmania in relation to a CBD and a roofed stadium. Can I remind the House, as I said before, this was initiated by the Tasmanian AFL taskforce. When Tasmanians looked at it for themselves and asked, 'What do we need to be successful in the AFL and to be able to claim a team of our own?' there were the two things that they determined under the leadership of Mr Godfrey.

Not surprisingly, the AFL and the Tasmanian government see that as being vital and agree. The next clause talks about opposing the government exceeding its $375 million spending cap. It is a bit like buying a house. When you go to a real estate agent, you say, 'I have only got so much capital by way of a deposit or a down payment on the house', the rest will have to be by way of borrowings. That has always been the government's business case in relation to this project.

We have said from the outset that $375 million will be the capital investment - if you like, our deposit into it. The rest would be made up by private-public partnerships and or borrowings. It has now become quite apparent that the best way to leverage and get the best return for our fellow Tasmanians with public-private partnerships is for us to develop the stadium, get it moving so we can leverage the best possible pricing from the surrounds and the developments that would suit the stadium - for example, a hotel facility.

Mrs Pentland - But you agree with polling, right? You note that the polling suggests that that is the point. The polling shows that Tasmanians -

The SPEAKER - They are still interjections, member for Bass.

Mr ABETZ - With respect to you, Speaker, I take the interjection. I am aware of the polling, especially in relation to what is asserted about the Project of State Significance, a process not being followed. If the question would have been to our fellow Tasmanians, 'Do you know that the Greens opposed the POSS process and now support the POSS process?' what would your view be? Somehow, the POSS process has been elevated into something like Holy Writ, when, in fact, the government was of the view it was not its favoured approach, but it was the only approach, the only pathway forward. That is why it was adopted, and the Greens opposed the POSS process at the time. At the time, they opposed and voted against the POSS process. Today, they favour it.

Why have they switched? Why have they changed? They were against the POSS process initially because they saw it as the pathway to achieving the stadium. Today they see the POSS process as the pathway of stopping the project, and that is why they have changed their mind. If our fellow Tasmanians were aware of that, I think they would take a differing view.

If the question was 'Do you realise that the people of Brisbane will be having a stadium built for the Olympics by way of special legislation? That they did that in Adelaide. We did it for our own Parliament Square, for the Meander Dam, et cetera. That they did it in Adelaide. They did it in Perth. What would your view be?' Special legislation for the Stony Rise development, would you have concerns? If it was in that context, I have a funny feeling the polls might be different.

That said, even if the polls are right. I know what the polls were telling us when we were promoting the GST, and when Paul Keating was promoting the floating of the Australian dollar.

Do you know what the task of parliamentarians is? Is not to lick your finger and see which way the wind is blowing, and say, 'Oh, that is my approach because that is what the polls are telling me.' Leadership requires courage and conviction and that is what Premier Rockliff is showing in relation to this.

I will add, if I am allowed to pass an accolade to the opposition, they have decided that it is the right thing to do as well, irrespective of the polls, because they know the long-term benefits it will provide for Tasmania.

For example, if the polling were to put the question, 'Do you realise that the Hobart City Council's own report in relation to the stadium shows an input of $179 million per annum into the Hobart City Council local government area - that is per annum as a result of the stadium - that would be the stimulus ongoing. Would you favour the stadium?' I think a lot of people would be saying, 'Oh yes, that sounds like an exceptionally good deal.' It is a question of the question that is put and the information that is in the public arena at the time.

We are then asked about Cricket Tasmania. Cricket Tasmania and Cricket Australia are in discussions, and Dominic Baker was, I think it was on ABC recently or SEN Radio in fact if I recall. Anyway, he spoke publicly and said discussions were still occurring and whilst the Greens thought it was funny that the Macquarie Point Development Corporation seeking to develop a test rig to satisfy Cricket Tasmania, they are the sort of discussions you want so that things continue.

Ms Rosol - So much misrepresentation here.

The SPEAKER - Ms Rosol will also cease her interjecting. I am not quite sure where you all think you are.

Mr ABETZ - Those sorts of discussions are continuing, and you can be assured that the government is in constant discussion with the local AFL, with the national AFL, and the discussions continue.

I would have to respectfully disagree with Mrs Pentland when she said words to the effect of, 'No one is saying that the deal should be torn up.' I happen to agree with you that it should not be, but there are certain people in the Greens, no matter what the deal is, they would like to rip it up. I dare say Ms Johnston, the member for Clark, would be in the same category. Unfortunately, there are people who do want to rip this deal up. We as a government want to protect it to ensure that the aspirations of our fellow Tasmanians can in fact be achieved.

In summary, there are strict timelines in relation to the development of the stadium, and if those strict timelines are not achieved, we will not be having a team. If we do not have a team, might I add to the people in my home area of Kingston, we will not be getting the high-performance centre and the $100 million-plus development that represents. There seems to be this view that we can somehow have a team, but without all the obligations necessary to make it a successful team. 

The AFL has certain conditions, not because they want to be bullies or anything like that, but because they want a successful team. They want the Tassie Devils to be successful and they know football, I suspect, better than all of us combined in this Chamber. When they say that for a Tassie Devils team to be successful, you need a high-performance centre, you do need a new stadium with all the facilities, then I think it is worthwhile listening to them, especially when our very own taskforce six years earlier said exactly the same thing. People with expertise in the area of successful AFL clubs are giving us the advice and yet we hear from the Greens and others that, somehow, we should not be listening to the experts in the area. They know what they are talking about, they know what is needed for a successful team and I look forward for us, as a parliament, to be voting for the legislation, which we hope to table within a few weeks, having taken into account public consultation on the drafts. 

We need to get ahead with this because, as the member for Franklin, Mr O'Byrne, said earlier today:

If Tasmania cannot deliver for itself this fundamental piece of infrastructure, this economic, social and cultural enhancer because we are too bloody-minded about these things, then we will become the laughing stock of the nation, and rightly so.

People will also be asking the question: 'If I have an investment dollar, why on earth should I be spending it in Tasmania when there are so many other areas in Australia or, indeed, internationally to get a return on the dollar?'

This stadium is going to be transformative, and everybody wants to have their say as to how it can be best done. There are a whole host of views. I get that, but at the end of the day, a decision has to be made, we have to move forward, we need to draw the line in the sand and say enough is enough, and we will not allow the pursuit of the perfect to get in the way of the good. We can argue all day as to what colour the stadium ought to be, or what shape or size, or whatever, but at the end of the day, let us get this done for Tasmania and especially for our city of Hobart to have this iconic gateway to our city. As a result, the government has problems in supporting this motion.

[6.28 p.m.]
Ms DOW (Braddon - Deputy Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, it has been a pretty big afternoon here in the House. We have had lots of debate, particularly from the commencement of private members time today where we saw quite emotive contributions from people about what this project means to them. I am not going to wait right to the end to tell you our position on this motion. I am going to let you know now that we will not be supporting it, but I am going to explain to you why.

There are points you make in this motion that you are quite right about. There are many Tasmanians who feel deeply against the project. Equally, I believe there are many Tasmanians who feel very strongly about the project and want to see it proceed. There are also Tasmanians who are sick of us talking about this project and wanting to talk about things that are important to them like health, housing, cost of living and education. We have a government that says it can do both of those things, chew gum and walk at the same time, but I have yet to see that from this Premier.

One of the things about this project that strikes me about all of its iterations, we have talked today in this place about our journey through this project and we have come to accept that to get an AFL licence, to get an AFLW team and an AFL men's team, we have to have a stadium. The AFL has been clear about that, so we accept that. We also accept that, due to this government's malaise, there is a lack of infrastructure projects in the pipeline across Tasmania. Our civil contractors, our Master Builders Association are looking for more work for their workers. When all is said and done, this is a major infrastructure project that will create economic activity and jobs for Tasmanians.

You go on in this motion to talk about the fact that you do not think the AFL has treated the state unfairly. I beg to differ. I think this government has treated Tasmanians unfairly right throughout this process. You do not have to think back that long ago to when the then premier, Peter Gutwein, came in here and announced in his state of the state address that there would be a floating stadium on the Derwent as part of his dream for Tasmania to have an AFL team. From there, we saw iterations of mishandling from this government. 

This is Premier Jeremy Rockliff's project now. Would others in this place have conducted the process in the way he has? I believe many members would agree that you would not have undertaken that process. That process has let Tasmanians down, whether that be his captain's call or the fact that this did not go to Treasury and did not go to Cabinet to begin with. He was inconsistent in his messaging around whether or not the stadium was contingent on the deal. There was no clarity on that. There were lots of calls about Cabinet-in-confidence and that information could not be provided to the public when, in fact, it could be. We have been here throughout, right up until the change of direction from Major Projects, where he folded under pressure within his party room to redirect this project through the POSS process. 

At every stage, this government put party before state. To my mind, that has been their downfall, and why we find ourselves in the budget position we are in, and the overall position of this state, where this government has mishandled and failed to deliver major projects. Tasmanians will suffer the economic consequences of that. I expect we will see more of that in tomorrow's Budget when it is handed down.

Correct me if I am wrong: I believe you support a stadium but you want to play a constructive role in how that comes to be, and that is why you bring this motion to the House. However, you have a supply and confidence agreement with the government. They rely on you. It should not take you to bring this motion to the House to have an influence on the way the Premier is managing this project. These are all things he should be doing right now and it should not be the will of the parliament to make him do that. You have your own ability to do that through your agreement with him. I would be interested to know whether you have discussed any of these aspects with the Premier before bringing this notice of motion to the parliament this afternoon. 

The final point I will make is in relation to the federal Labor government. Obviously, we speak all the time to our federal Labor colleagues and will continue to do that about what we think is in the best interest of Tasmania, where we think there is a need for funding for projects, particular policy decisions they might take. That is something we do as a caucus and our leader, Dean Winter, does very regularly. Therefore, we do not see the need to be supporting that as part of this motion.

Summing up, I understand why the member has brought this motion to the House this evening. I understand that you want to play a constructive role in this. We have made it clear we are not writing blank cheques. We want to be casting a lot of scrutiny over this project. Tasmanians deserve that. I get feedback from Tasmanians right across the state about their view on this project. My commitment to them, and our commitment as a team, is that we will scrutinise this project every step of the way and will continue to do that. That is our commitment.

There are things in here that I believe that you could already be negotiating and talking with the government about because as I have said, they rely on you, they are in minority, they are incredibly unstable. It is a day-by-day proposition for them in this place, and they should be listening to you and to your input into the decisions that they make and the processes that they undertake.

The Premier came in here this week, and he has spoken about his interactions with Cricket Tasmania and Cricket Australia. That is his problem; he needs to sort it. He said that he will deliver this project for Tasmania and the ball is fairly and squarely in his court. It is not a role of the parliament to call him to have those meetings. He should be having those meetings already.

Thank you very much for bringing forward this motion. We will not be supporting it. I understand where you are coming from, and I hope that I have made our position clear.

[6.35 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to speak on the member for Bass's motion on respecting the community's voice and re-engaging with the AFL amongst other groups and I thank you for the motion that you have brought today.

We know that community opposition to the Liberals' Macquarie Point Stadium is at an all-time high. I rallied a couple of weeks ago with thousands of people on Tasmania's parliament lawns against this dodgy stadium. There was a huge sense of disquiet amongst that group who were there. We know they are representative of many Tasmanians across the state.

In my own electorate of Bass, I have been having conversations with many people for years who are opposed to the stadium, but even in the last week, people who have come and spoken with me about completely unrelated matters have spontaneously raised the stadium and drawn the connection between the stadium and the money that the government plans to invest in the stadium and what that will mean for them missing out on the services that they need and money not being invested in those services.

We know that there is strong opposition to the stadium because 839 submissions were made to the Tasmanian Planning Commission and 85 per cent of those were opposed to or critical of the project. We have had recent polling which the member for Bass has made reference to in her motion, and that polling shows that 70 per cent of Tasmanians are opposed to the Liberals spending more than the promised $375 million on the stadium.

Even 40 per cent of those people who do want the stadium are against going over the cap. We know that up around 60 per cent statewide are against the stadium, and in the north of the state that figure is far higher.

Unsurprisingly, at the same time, the Liberals' level of support has dropped to its lowest level in two decades. There is a connection there. This project is deeply unpopular in the community and it is affecting the way Tasmanians are evaluating their representatives in parliament, and they are dropping in favour of the people.

This week we have finally seen the Liberals admit that the stadium will cost more than their initial estimate of $715 million. They have increased that projection to $945 million. They still will not admit they have broken their promise to Tasmanians to ensure no more than $375 million is spent on the stadium, but every direction that you look here, these figures are a moving feast. They are rubbery.

We know the costs will not stop at $945 million. We have half a plan. How can we possibly know how much it will cost? This government has a history of budget blowouts. The AFL High-Performance Centre has gone up over 60 per cent, the Cradle cableway price has tripled, and the wharf upgrades at Devonport will be five times more than first estimated.

We know that this is a stadium which is going to cost more than a billion dollars. This is money that could otherwise have been spent on services that Tasmanians really need, like health, housing and education. This stadium will put us into significant debt. It will mean that Tasmanians miss out on what they really need. That is why this stadium is not popular. It makes no sense that we invest this money in a stadium when we have great stadiums, and particularly one at York Park in Launceston, which is already in the process of being upgraded.

I think that the minister takes Tasmanians for fools. He spent quite some time in here suggesting that if different questions had been asked in the recent polls that people would have somehow responded to the poll differently. Tasmanians are not fools. They can look at these figures, they can look at these plans and they can see what this will do to our state. It is time that the government stopped gaslighting the people of Tasmania and started respecting them for their views and acknowledging that this project is deeply unpopular.

The majority of Tasmanians also have issues with the Liberals bypassing the independent planning process and trying to ram the stadium through with enabling legislation in parliament. Fair enough, too. This is a completely corrupted process. It is worse than what Paul Lennon did with the pulp mill.

We saw yesterday in the draft bill released by the government that this bill will give unprecedented powers to the minister. It is not even worth the paper that it is written on because it can be changed at the whim of the minister. Any conditions on the stadium made by parliament the government can rip up. If we thought the Spirits fiasco was bad, this is going to be so much worse because minister Abetz will be able to do whatever he wants to make this stadium happen, no matter how dodgy. The minister will effectively be the proponent, the planning authority, and the regulator. How is that good process in any way, shape or form?

The Tasmanian Planning Commission has raised a number of issues with the stadium as it currently stands, and it is unclear whether these have been addressed in the bill. That is why we were asking for scrutiny committees in our motion this afternoon because we need to have as many opportunities to examine and scrutinise this stadium's plan as we possibly can.

This stadium, fully cooked and half-baked, will be an eyesore among Hobart's heritage-laden landscape, our beautiful landscape, it will cause gridlock in the already struggling transport system, and it will not even be fit for a cricket match as it stands at the moment.

What we have is a project that is dodgy. It is 50 per cent planned. We are expected to vote on it without really knowing what we are voting on. This needs to be renegotiated. It is a dud deal that we have to have this stadium. It is not even true. I know when the member for Bass was speaking before, she talked about it is common for contracts to be renegotiated. Things change, people come back to the board, and they look at it again and they work things over and find new ways forward when the situation changes. That is what needs to happen here in this situation with the stadium.

We know that Tasmanians are passionate about football, and we deserve a team in Tasmania. The Greens wrote to the AFL last week outlining some of this history and asking for the AFL to reconsider. Minister Abetz, who was here just before, can say that the AFL are not bullies, but they have made this incredible demand on Tasmania, demanded that we have a stadium that is going to send us into debt, demanded that our money be put to their stadium and not put into the services that Tasmanians need.

Maybe bullying is a word that the minister is not comfortable with, but how about state capture? This government has been captured by the AFL, and they are dancing on the end of their puppet strings.

Tasmania has been a part of the Australian Rules football since the sport began. The Launceston Football Club is about to celebrate its 150th birthday. It was formed before clubs like Collingwood, Richmond, and Hawthorn. For decades and decades Tasmanians have been fighting for an AFL team on top of this incredible history with AFL in our state. The Greens have been consistent as part of that fight for a team. We have long said that we support a team in Tasmania. Despite this history, despite our proud record of producing football stars, the AFL has not believed in Tasmania.

Tasmanians have come out in force to support the Devils. As the minister said, we have just reached 210,000 founding members this week. However, we are not being respected by the AFL when they have these huge demands on us. That is why recent polling shows that Tasmanians believe the AFL has treated Tasmanians unfairly because they have treated us unfairly. We have proven that the Devils are going to be successful no matter what. 210,000 members. There is already momentum in the team, so it is unfair that the AFL is holding Tasmanians to a dodgy stadium deal when it could be renegotiated. It is time for the Liberals to get their priorities straight and it is time for them to renegotiate this deal. The minister spoke earlier about firm leadership. Well, firm leadership is standing up to the AFL, standing up for Tasmanians, renegotiating this deal and getting a deal that is good for our state instead of a deal that is a dud. We deserve a team. We do not deserve a dodgy stadium.

As I said at the beginning, we thank Mrs Pentland for this motion that she has brought to us today. The Greens will be supporting it. We are in agreement with many of the things in this motion. We acknowledge the polling, we acknowledge the change in the financial situation and we certainly support any negotiations that would lead to a better deal for Tasmanians.

[6.45 p.m.]
Mr JENNER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I think everybody knows my position on the stadium, and with each passing day it becomes more and more obvious why I have taken this stance. This stadium has done the complete opposite to what the government had intended it to do. It has undeniably divided our state.

As the motion states, recent polling commissioned by the Federal Group makes it crystal clear that half of all respondents oppose the stadium project, with a striking 38 per cent expressing strong opposition. That is nearly double the combined 24 per cent support, including only 14 per cent who strongly support it. The numbers do not lie. The majority of Tasmanians are not on board.

The government can no longer dismiss this as the grumblings of a vocal minority. It is not. It is a loud, clear voice of the majority of Tasmanians who expect their concerns to be heard and respected. To quote Dr Broad:

The biggest problem we are seeing is this government deliberately dividing the state. They are not dividing the state in half. It is pretty clear that more than half of the state is very against the stadium.

Both the government and the opposition need to acknowledge what the vast majority of Tasmanians want. Tasmanians want and deserve a team, that much is undeniable, but it is equally clear they do not want this stadium. Pointing to the over 200,000-strong membership for the new team only highlights the passion for a team itself, not the stadium that comes at the expense of the community's needs.

The government needs to stop conflating the two and start listening to what Tasmanians are actually saying. They are not saying no to a team, they are saying no to an unnecessary, costly stadium. There are so many issues with this stadium from start to finish. That much cannot be denied: the cost, the location, the toll it will take on the traffic and now the joke that is this enabling legislation.

Mr Abetz stated just before that he doubts that many of us have finished reading the draft enabling legislation. Well, I have, and it does absolutely nothing but make me more than sure of the decision to stand against this stadium. I have read the legislation and it is nothing more than a stitch-up for the government's pet project. It does away with the usual checks and balances, strips away local voices, bypasses the planning commission and hands everything over to one minister. It is a power grab dressed up as progress, but we are not here to debate enabling legislation, so I will go back to the motion at hand.

I will be voting with this motion as I believe the AFL, Cricket Tasmania and the federal government need to know exactly how the majority of Tasmanians are feeling. They need to know how much we want and deserve a team, but not at the expense of sending our state broke.

[6.48 p.m.]
Mr SHELTON (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I rise this evening to make my contribution to this motion. As minister Abetz has already indicated, we will be voting against the motion because we believe in the Macquarie Point Stadium and what it will deliver for Tasmania as a whole, and, of course, the southern region in particular. We are committed to delivering the transformative infrastructure at Macquarie Point. At the core will be a multipurpose stadium capable of hosting AFL international cricket, conventions, major concerts and events.

All the debate so far has been about football, and it is a multiuse stadium with the convention centre. I will indicate to the members here that if you were going to build a 1500 seat convention centre, where would there be a better place in Hobart than that position? The position is strong for a convention centre. It is strong for an AFL stadium. It is within walking distance of the CBD; it highlights the harbour and all that it brings, and it is within Salamanca and so forth. The position is an ideal position.

It will enliven the city and surrounding businesses and give visitors an experience. It is an enabling piece of infrastructure that will bring the waterfront to life. As the minister has said, Hobart City Councils' own analysis found that the stadium would bring over $143 million per year in benefits to the city during construction and $179 million per year when operational and that the stadium would inevitably have a transformative economic impact on the CBD and the broader LGA.
We know when the stadium gets the green light it will unlock a flurry of surrounding private sector activities. All of that adds up to social and economic value to the state. We are getting on with delivering the stadium and to go through and to address the motion to go through a renegotiation would be the downfall of the stadium and therefore the team.

It has been said a number of times there is no negotiation from the AFL's point of view. I have got a different view when dealing with the issue of the AFL. It has been said the AFL are bullies by bringing this in. It is my view that when the AFL were in negotiations, they indicated to the state that you need to provide a team with the best chance of success in the league, and the best chance of success in the league is to provide infrastructure that young men and women appreciate and can provide the best performance that they can provide.

I was involved with the Sheffield Rowing Club before it was a rowing club. The Sheffield area had Lake Barrington which is a world-class rowing facility, and the local town, Sheffield, never had a rowing club. Some members up there wanted to develop or create a rowing club. I went to a fundraiser in the Sheffield pub, and they invited a young guy then who was an ex-Olympic rower who was involved with the Tasmanian cricket side as a specialist coach and he put to the people there the issue of mental toughness and mental training in young people. In my days of football, of course, you put up with a coach yelling and screaming at you and were managing that.

Mrs PENTLAND - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance.

The SPEAKER - Standing Order 45 does not apply to contributions outside of Question Time. There is a Standing Order that does. I will draw the member to the matter before the house.

Mr SHELTON - My story is to do with the provision of contemporary facilities at the club. He was saying that the today's AFL game is a mental game. You see clubs perform well one week and not the other. They have mental coaches, and the effort goes into their teams to prepare their players, both men and women, prepare their mental state. It is physical state and mental state, and therefore contemporary buildings and contemporary facilities are critical for the performance. The AFL have said in their process when dealing with Tasmania, 'To provide your team with the best opportunity to perform and to win - and we all want a successful club - this is what you need to do. You need to provide these facilities for a team and therefore a stadium, of course, is the number one ticket item on providing those facilities.

As far as a renegotiation goes, of course what the AFL have said is we will give you $330 million over the 10 years to underwrite the club and to provide regional football in the area and to support AFL teams in the area. That money is critical to underwrite the club. As critical as that is, as Brendon Gale has said, you actually need the stadium as a finance mechanism for the club and without that happening and the $18-20 million that you would get from game day resources, then of course it does not make the club viable.

The other point to this is that we all agree with the club, but a club and therefore the stadium provides at a minimum around $45 or $50 million a year. In a business sense, it takes $45 to $50 million a year to run an AFL club. That is a $50 million business that Tasmania does not have today that it will have once it starts playing and the club is actually up and running and there are game days and so on.

It is an economic driver from that economic sense of employing people, physiotherapists and doctors and trainers and they are all employed. It is a big business; it is one Tasmania does not have at the moment.

I have a lot more to say and will have an opportunity to say more on the stadium as we get into that debate, but I know there are other people who would like a couple of minutes. As I said, I could talk for a lot longer yet, but I will leave my contribution there. The renegotiation, of course, would more than likely lead to the fact that we would not have a team at all going forward.

[6.57 p.m.]
Mrs BESWICK (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to give my contribution on the motion brought by Mrs Pentland. I note what other people have said around this room regarding this motion and bring them back to what we are actually debating today. I noted that the Leader of Government Business spoke about being very concerned about the word 'deep' in this motion and it acknowledges the 'deep and growing community division' over the Macquarie Point Stadium proposal.

The Deputy Leader of Labor mentioned the many different views of all the different people throughout Tasmania and how some are very pro, and some are very negative and that is basically what this sentence says. It says, 'a deep and growing community division'. It does not talk about one side of the debate; it is both. It notes the finding of recent polling commissioned by Federal Group and what the polling states. The House is not trying to say that we are in agreement with the polling, we are just trying to say that we are noting that this polling exists.

It recognises the current stadium agreement exposes Tasmanian taxpayers to financial risk and that much more is known about the project than when the Prime Minister committed to $240 million in April in 2023. My colleague and other Independent member for Braddon brought this up in Question Time this morning - is that $240 million going to be able to be kept? Are we still going to have that when we have not got a housing plan in place?

Are we sure that there are not some stipulations on that money, that it cannot be used the way the government is planning to use it?

Time expired.

WAIVER OF PRIVATE MEMBERS' TIME

Mr WOOD (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, in accordance with Standing Order 42, I indicate that government private members' business is waived for this day's sitting.


ADJOURNMENT

[7.07 p.m.]
Ms HOWLETT (Lyons - Minister for Primary Industries and Water) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House does now adjourn.


National Volunteer Week - Landcare

[7.07 p.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I will be brief. I want to note that last week, from 19 May to 25 May, was National Volunteer Week. In 2023, the state of volunteering research found that just under - by 0.2 per cent - 70 per cent of Tasmanians aged 15 years and over volunteered their time in 2023.

That is quite an extraordinary effort, because volunteering is the backbone of our community. It has tremendous benefits for those who are doing it as well, from our firefighters and emergency service workers who volunteer, through to the community food hubs that run off the back of volunteers, Meals on Wheels, the Country Women's Association (CWA), Community Transport Services, and our critical Online Access Centres.

There were various events across the nation that took place, and a very exciting event was the Brighton City Council's Annual Volunteer Awards. I note that fellow member for Lyons, Mr Jenner, was there, as well as the president of the other place.

I congratulate Geoff Hull from the Brighton Food Hub. It is the third year in a row that the food hub has won an award at that ceremony for the extraordinary work they do.

That same 2023 report by Volunteering Tasmania showed that the staggering figure of 89.4 million hours were volunteered in that year, which enabled $12.1 billion in economic benefit for Tasmania. That cost to replace the labour of Tasmania's volunteers would be $3.6 billion a year. That is an enormous effort, and it is also shared with a degree of caution that we do not want to become over-reliant on volunteer efforts and push that pressure by underfunding any kind of services.

An extraordinary volunteer group, which I am sure all members in this place have participated with at some point, is Landcare. They do extraordinary work with community empowerment, from their tree planting through to their invasive species action, whether that is willows, blackberries or gorse. The extraordinary work Bill Harvey is doing, in particular leading the biochar workshops and showing the benefits that can bring, deserves an entire adjournment in itself.

I rise specifically tonight to share Landcare's Decision Guide for Stray and Feral Cat Management in Tasmania 2025, released at the start of this month. This guide delves into all different kind of land tenures and what anyone, from your individual farmer or household, private property owners through to agricultural businesses and councils, can or cannot do within their area to help control the stray and feral cat problem. This is a huge problem, which is incredibly detrimental to our local fauna, particularly endemic birdlife, and it is critical that we do all that we can to help fix this. 

This is a very important guide. It is critical that all members in this place have a copy so they can share it with their constituents. I know the government is still working on the Cat Management Plan 2024-2029, and it is not quite online yet. In the interim, we have what will prove as a foundational guide. I congratulate Landcare for the work they put into this because it is not easy to pull together anything that crosses different land tenures and levels of government, private and public sectors. What they have done is exceptional. They have condensed it into a report that anyone can get. It was circulated to members earlier today via email.

Honourable Speaker, I wish to seek leave to table the Decision Guide for Stray and Feral Cat Management in Tasmania 2025. 

Leave granted.


Small Business Licensing Reforms

[7.12 p.m.]
Ms HOWLETT (Lyons - Minister for Hospitality and Small Business) - Honourable Speaker, we want to make Tasmania the best place in Australia to do business, and we have launched a war on red tape. We will be putting in place nation-leading small business start-up permits, undertaking a full order of all state and local licences, permits and approvals, and establishing a red tape reduction industry taskforce.

We will also be delivering sweeping reforms of the liquor licensing process, with a new digital system. If an application is not rejected within 10 days, it will be deemed approved. Liquor licence regulations will be modernised to allow licensees to make simple amendments like updating their location and getting rid of multiple permits for serving alcohol outdoors or extending hours for special events; and a single permit will be introduced for festivals and events. 

We will also be introducing single-form tendering for businesses to reduce the complexity associated with government contracts.

As the Minister for Hospitality and Small Business, I am proud to speak about a bold new step the Tasmanian government is taking to support local entrepreneurs: the small business start-up permit. Starting up a business should not be held back by red tape, yet we have seen far too many promising ventures stall or even collapse because of months of long delays in securing government permits. This new permit is designed to change that.

With the final design of the small business start-up permit now underway, in preparation for the legislative process through the parliament, the Tasmanian government is advancing another key reform aimed at cutting red tape for small businesses. The proposed start-up permit will apply for low-risk business types, those with minimum risk of harm to people or places, allowing entrepreneurs to get started more easily with fewer regulatory hurdles. This initiative, alongside other reforms such as the improvements to liquor licensing, reflects the Tasmanian government's strong commitment to reducing barriers for businesses. 

These changes are designed to give local entrepreneurs greater confidence to invest, innovate and create jobs. The start-up permit will allow small businesses to trial new ventures without the burden of securing all necessary long-term permits up front, reducing both cost and complexity in the early stages. With proper safeguards and oversight, this initiative clears a path for passionate Tasmanians to pursue their ideas and open the doors to a stronger, more vibrant small business sector. This reform could become one of the most significant small business initiatives in the country, positioning Tasmania as a startup capital of Australia.


Tasmania Police - Roster Arrangements

[7.15 p.m.]
Ms BUTLER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I rise on the Adjournment tonight to discuss the failure of this government and Police minister to support our hardworking, already overwhelmed police officers. This government is more than happy to do media presentations with police officers, roll out the tough-on-crime mantra and make sure they are on the front page of the paper, but they are not prepared to back our police officers and give them the wellbeing rosters they deserve. It is not on.

Police Association of Tasmania President, Shane Tilley, has written an article that explains the matters well. The article was written in the hope that the Police minister would be able to see the firsthand experience and examples Mr Tilley provided in the article, outlining why those rosters are so important to Tasmanian police officers. You have police officers who now have a workers compensation rate of 15-17 per cent, and it is increasing. There is a huge retention issue as well. Over 85 per cent of police officers who were surveyed about the wellbeing rosters saying they really support them. They want an opportunity to find a work-life balance. After seven years of trialling the wellbeing rosters, it is not good enough to then suddenly turn around and say, 'Sorry, we're going back to the Ottawa system, we're going back to the previous rostering system from 20 years ago.' This is absolutely against what their members are telling them they need. It is extremely disappointing.

I do not think it is any coincidence that since this government cut the police budget by $35 million, suddenly they cannot afford the overtime for the wellbeing rosters. Why should police have to pay for that? They are saying they need the opportunity to have a better work-life balance, they are saying retention is an issue, they are saying they are feeling burnt out, and all this government does is ignore them and go back to the original Ottawa rostering system. All that is going to do is decrease retention and make it even more difficult for our hard-working police officers to be able to turn up to work each day and do the amazing job they do. It is just not good enough. It is appalling.

I only have two minutes left, so I will try to read some of the highlights of Shane Tilley's article in the Mercury. 

He is angry that management plan to go back to an old rostering system they say will lead to officer fatigue. The police union has slammed the management decision to go back to a 30-year-old rostering system, describing it as betrayal of frontline officers which will jeopardise public safety. 

Acting deputy commissioner Adrian Bodnar confirmed all 24/7 stations would return to the award Ottawa roster on 7 July and said all members had been consulted extensively, but Police Association of Tasmania President Shane Tilley says:

It is a regressive step, and the decision should be immediately reversed. Two years ago, police began trialling a modern six-on six-off, four-on four-off roster. To abandon modern roster reforms and revert to a 30-year-old scheduling system is more than just a bureaucratic misstep; it is a betrayal of the frontline officers who put their physical and mental well-being on the line every single day for the safety of our communities.

These trial rosters were not just workplace preferences, they were foundational to improving officer health, boosting retention and recruiting the next generation of police. The return to the Ottawa roster, a five-week rotating cycle, culminating in seven consecutive night shifts, is a regressive step. This is not just about comfort or convenience, it is about public safety.
Mr Tilley questioned whether it was a way of saving money. I think it definitely is a reaction to the cost-cutting that has happened - $35 million cut from the police budget. It is not good enough to say you are tough on crime and to set yourself up in media opportunities with police officers when you are not prepared to support them.


Southern Tasmania - Urban Growth Boundary Changes

[7.20 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to speak about urban growth boundary changes. Last week, the Minister for Housing and Planning, Mr Ellis, using his ministerial powers, approved an extension of southern Tasmania's urban growth boundaries by 615 hectares, citing this as a passage to unlocking housing developments in Rokeby, Sorell, Brighton, Margate and beyond.

Of course we need more homes. Our housing crisis has clearly reached record highs this year with over 5,000 Tasmanians on the waitlist for social and affordable homes. We can think of better, more creative, more sustainable ways to solve the housing crisis. Minister Ellis said the changes could provide 10,000 additional homes and this is refuted by many people, including Peter McGlone from the Tasmanian Conservation Trust who refutes the number of houses that the minister, Mr Ellis, suggests can be built.

One example is the Richardson Road proposal, which was originally refused by Clarence Council, but apparently minister Ellis knows best. Is he delivering housing need or is he responding to developer greed? He certainly is not delivering to the region's regional land use strategy because he has dropped the ball on that. It has not been delivered. It is well out of date, and this is a travesty, again, of strategic planning. I quote minister Ellis:

This release of land in the southern region sets us up for significant and sustainable growth.

which is what he said on the ABC. However, this is not according to professionals from the Planning Institute and the Australian Institute of Architects Tasmanian Chapter. I will quote from their submission in relation to the urban growth boundary proposed update of March 2025. The institute says in its response that it does not believe that the urban growth boundary should be increased. They then acknowledge that the government must enable the provision of more homes, done in a way that retains what makes Hobart a unique and desirable place to live.

Other quotes talk about why the urban growth boundary expansion would have negative impacts. These points are: because of increased costs to taxpayers to provide infrastructure; increased disadvantage to future occupants living on the outskirts of our city; increased negative health impacts due to proximity to amenities or lack thereof; increased traffic congestion; social isolation; and increased environmental impacts.

There are also solutions in the Institute of Architects' submission. They talk about encouraging densification of inner-city areas and they know, they hear from developers, that it is not always financially viable due to land costs, site-specific conditions, planning requirements and approval complexities, but that does not mean that the government should not be looking at finding solutions for inner-city development. Instead of slapping in new developments on the urban fringe that lack critical public transport, infrastructure and access to amenities such as schools, hospitals, and grocery shops, let us invest in other hidden gems, such as the Hobart to Glenorchy corridor as recently proposed by the Tasmanian chapter of the Planning Institute of Australia. If we look at the rail corridor, we have often talked about rail versus what form of transport. Over 15 years there have been 14 separate studies in relation to energising this area.
It is about time that the government acts, the government was more strategic in their framework for planning for sustainable growth - sustainable for the environment rather than on the fringes where there is this conflict of environmental protection. We could have a win-win by incentivising or having more development in the inner city.

Launceston - Australia's Tidiest Town 2025

[7.26 p.m.]
Mr WOOD (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, it is a privilege tonight to have the opportunity to pay tribute to my home town - and, indeed, your home town - of Launceston, located in our electorate of Bass, which has recently been named Australia's Tidiest Town for 2025. The annual awards, which were celebrated this year in Beechworth, Victoria, started in 1968 in Western Australia under the banner of 'Keep Australia Beautiful', and have been running nationally since 1990. These awards reward towns and communities that successfully adopt sustainability programs and promote anti-litter campaigns.

This year there were six national finalists: Kingston SE in South Australia, Parkes in New South Wales, Ikuntji in the Northern Territory, Port and South Hedland in Western Australia, Rye in Victoria, and, of course, dear Launceston.

With a population of over 71,000, Launceston is renowned for its lifestyle-orientated focus, its rich history, stunning natural scenery and rolling hills, top-notch education, and thriving, vibrant arts and event scene. Launceston's commitment to sustainability is evident in its innovative initiatives, strong community commitment and impressive achievements across various categories. An emphasis on community engagement and partnerships is central to its success, demonstrating a deep-rooted community commitment.

Home Energy Audit Toolkits, an excellent local Repair Cafe initiative, recycling hubs, the Towards Zero Emissions Action Plan, inclusion in the government's Reward Recycle scheme, and Launceston's City Sustainability Strategy and Action Plan are just a few examples of how Launceston is striving to be a leader in sustainability.

The city's innovative approach to challenges, particularly in resource recovery and circular economy projects, also set it apart, with commitment to best practice and achievement of targets setting a standard for other councils across Australia. Launceston is focused on addressing climate change, reducing environmental degradation while working to achieve zero emissions and zero waste to landfill.

Overall, Launceston's accomplishments in the 2025 Australian Tidy Towns competition demonstrated its dedication to best practices, community engagement and fostering a sustainable and liveable environment for all residents.

The City of Launceston was also awarded two further wins in the litter prevention category for having a project that focuses on minimising what goes into landfill and assists in creating a circular economy, and for their water conservation and protection project that takes action to address local litter issues around prevention and reduction.

Spring Clean Rocherlea was a community-led initiative addressing illegal dumping and waste management challenges in Rocherlea. Many residents face barriers to proper waste disposal including cost, lack of transport and awareness of services. The Rocherlea Action Project, a collaborative community group, organised a community clean up event and free BBQ, engaging volunteers and providing waste disposal support. Promotion of the event was achieved through flyers, road signs and word of mouth. Key stakeholders of the project included residents, community groups, local businesses and of course the City of Launceston.

For more than five decades, Keep Australia Beautiful's Tidy Town Awards have been recognised and rewarding initiatives that contribute to a more sustainable and resilient Australia. The Tidy Town name has always been synonymous with community pride and community action. The awards encourage, motivate and celebrate the sustainability achievements of grassroots, rural and regional communities across Australia.

This is the true tidy town spirit, and I am honoured to be serving the City of Launceston as a local member for Bass.

The Principal Petitioner's Reply to Government's Response to Petitions No. 14 and 15 of 2025

[7.30 p.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I rise this evening to table the Principal Petitioner's reply to the government's response to petitions Numbers 14 and 16. The Government tabled its response on 6 May. The Principal Petitioner has already sent this letter to the relevant Minister and Premier. The letter responds in detail to the government's response.

It covers the number of matters that are directly relevant to the policy debate which is currently occurring about Marinus Link and other related renewable energy projects and will add to the important public debate which the Whole-of-State Business Case will generate. 

While I am not necessarily endorsing the contents of the Principal Petitioner's letter, as a sponsor of the original petition, I now seek to table this Principal Petitioner's response. I have circulated this document along with my intentions to seek to table it to all House MPs earlier today.

Leave granted, paper tabled.


Health System Pressures

[7.32 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, on Monday morning I had the unfortunate circumstance of needing to call an ambulance for a member of my family. I want to express my thanks to the paramedic who came to us at the time and provided amazing service. Many thanks to Seb, who was the community paramedic who came to our house and assisted us. He was able to make an assessment to provide treatment and then came back four hours later to check up and see how we were going. We were very grateful, and I am pleased to report that my family member is back to good health now after receiving excellent treatment.

In thanking the paramedic who came to our place, I acknowledge the many incredible health workers that we have across our state who work across many different services, whether it is Ambulance Tasmania or in our hospitals, in mental health services, in community health, or in the Child Health and Parenting Service. I am sure I have missed some of the areas there, but there are many different areas of our health service where we have incredible staff providing excellent care and doing their best to meet the needs of Tasmanians across the state who need healthcare.

In saying that, I want to raise concerns because I know that many of our health staff across Tasmania are working in very difficult, stressful circumstances. We know that there have been efficiency dividends and budget-saving measures that have been applied. We know that the government is assessing job by job whether vacancies can be filled, and they have been refusing to fill vacancies. All of this increases the pressures on our health system and increases the pressures on our staff.

We know that there are staff, particularly in our emergency departments, who are in very stressful situations, working understaffed on many shifts and this is creating incredible pressure for them.

In this week when the Budget is to be handed down, we will be able to look and see what the government is investing in. We will be looking closely to see what the government is investing in and the impact that it will make on health services, and the impact that it will have on our incredible health staff.

I also acknowledge that, in our situation, we had a very timely arrival of the ambulance, excellent treatment, and a great outcome, but, for many Tasmanians, they have to wait a long time - longer than is advisable to have an ambulance arrive. There are Tasmanians who wait for a very long time in emergency departments for treatment. While our situation was good, for many people, that does not happen, so we continue to raise this and bring it to public attention. Our health services are incredibly important for all of us and we need to make sure that they are available for everybody at the time that they are needed, in a timely way, so that they can all have good outcomes.

The Greens will be watching that. We continue to call for the investment that is needed, not just in dollar figures that can be claimed to be amazing big levels of investment, but to look at the need and ensure that the needs of all Tasmanians are being met.


Hobart City Mission

[7.35 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about Hobart City Mission, the services it offers and its needs. I start by acknowledging upfront that housing is a human right and that action is clearly needed. We need action on rent controls. We need action on no-cause evictions. Renters need to be able to make minor modifications to their properties. We need to end the bleed of whole-home rentals to short-stay accommodation and, of course, we need to build more homes.
The housing crisis is acute, let us make no mistake about that. The priority list is the largest it has ever been at over 5000. People are waiting over 80 weeks. That is not 5000 people; that is 5000 applications. That is couples, that is families, that is more than 5000 people, and the government's approach is failing. We have consistently seen them fudge the figures in terms of their target for 10,000 new social and affordable homes by 2032 by adding in vacant lots, crisis accommodation, affordable rentals, affordable home purchases and the like.

We will be looking carefully at tomorrow's budget to see the funding needed to build homes and to support people. Speaking about crisis accommodation, I specifically wanted to talk about Hobart City Mission, because last week I had the pleasure of joining Harvey, Ewan, Eric and others from Hobart City Mission on a tour of some of their facilities.

It is 172 years old, and I am in awe of its staff and volunteers. It is the oldest mission in Australia and the third oldest in the world that has a vision of creating compassionate, resilient and connected local communities and a purpose to bring people who give and people in need together through the provision of client-focused, holistic and innovative services. It has a purpose-built home that was built literally 170 years ago in the 1850s in Barrack Street, where it has its head office and a safe space program.

The day safe space program is open from 8.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. daily, including weekends and public holidays, and it is open to anyone in need of food, connection to support services and the like. There is no need to drop in and no need for an appointment. You can just drop in at any time for safe support and advice. It is quite an incredible facility. Just up the road in Davey Street is the safe night space that I toured earlier in the year at an open day, and that was really well attended. I went back there last week with Harvey and Ewan. It is open of an evening, 6.00 p.m. to 8.00 a.m. including weekends and public holidays. There are some renovations underway to make the bathroom facilities better and it has facilities for 35 people.

Beds are racked up within the hall of this original old church, including space for pets. It is a booking system, so you need to get into that via Housing Connect or via a case manager, but again, it provides a safe, sheltered place. It offers meals and it offers critical support services to some of its clients. It saves the public money by reducing ambulance callout, emergency department visits, police involvement and reliance on income services.

The Hobart City Council has some other programs - Small Steps and DIY Dads, but I really wanted to talk about the Mountain View program, which was launched in October 2020 to address the need for stable, long-term housing in southern Tasmania. It is an old motel site on the Brooker Highway converted to basic residential accommodation. It targets people on the housing Tasmania priority waitlist. It comprises 32 units with dedicated staff and offers wrap-around services, so those clients can get all sorts of different services to assist them with their specific needs. It focuses on fostering a strong sense of community and helping residents work towards their goals. It has been evaluated by a UTAS PhD candidate to confirm that it delivers exceptional services.

This is a proven social investment with guaranteed returns for individuals and the wider community. The current context is that budget pressures are making it incredibly hard and its CEO, Harvey Lennon, is on the record articulating both the value and its needs.

He wrote in the Mercury just two weeks ago:

When someone finally gets off the street into safe, supported housing, the ripple effects are remarkable. Lives stabilise, pressure on emergency services drops and people can begin to find hope and see a better future for themselves and for others.

He writes at the end that:

Currently, the Hobart City Mission has received no ongoing government support funding for Mountain View, despite rising demand and overwhelming community support. We've had to rely on donations and reserves to keep it running, something that isn't viable much longer. We're calling on the Tasmanian government to help. We're desperately in need of their help.

We will be watching the budget really closely tomorrow to see if that help is delivered.

Time expired.

The House adjourned at 7.40 p.m.

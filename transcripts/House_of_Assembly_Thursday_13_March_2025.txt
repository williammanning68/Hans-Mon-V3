RECOGNITION OF VISITORS

The SPEAKER - Honourable members, I welcome to the gallery year 10, 11 and 12 Legal Studies students from MacKillop Catholic College, all the way over the river from Mornington. Thank you very much for joining us today. You will be delighted with how beautifully behaved everyone is going to be.

Members - Hear, hear.


QUESTIONS

Budget Mismanagement

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.02 a.m.]
Last night Saul Eslake delivered a devastating assessment of your budget mismanagement at the University of Tasmania Island of Ideas event. He demonstrated Tasmania's total debt is, and I quote:

… clearly the worst of any state or territory …

and showed this budget disaster:

… has occurred entirely on the present government's watch.

Tasmanians will be most concerned about what he said this mismanagement means for their future. He said:

Tasmanians will be hurt as a result, no two ways about it.

The real question now is: who gets hurt and by how much? This is your mess. Who are you going to hurt to pay for the absolute mess that you have created and how badly will they be hurt?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, we are the ones with a plan on this side of the Chamber, a very clear plan at that. It is cutting red tape and regulation. It is reforming the GBEs. It is having a right-sized public service to deliver for Tasmanians. That service delivery is about what Tasmanians care about.

It is about health. It is about our schools - and I welcome our students here today. It is about police on the beat. It is about ensuring housing and putting a roof over the heads of Tasmanians - all keys investments that we have made over the course of the last 10 years.

The member points to investment and debt. We have a pathway to surplus with our plan. What is your alternative plan?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left and right.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You want to maximise GBE profit to return to surplus. What that means is increasing and boosting dividends by 620 per cent in the first year alone. What that means is regos going up to $4000 under a Winter Labor government.

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker.

Mr ROCKLIFF - What that means is that the average power bill will go from $2200 to $13,000 -

The SPEAKER - Order, Premier, I have called the point of order.

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Standing Order 2, accuracy of statements. The Premier has just claimed - I have never heard this before - that Labor was putting prices up. Could he explain where he gets this idea from before he continues to make baseless allegations like this?

The SPEAKER - Thank you. Standing Order 2 requires members to always be truthful in their dealings in this House. If the member has a substantive complaint that he would like to make about the Premier misleading, he may do so. 

I remind all members to be truthful in their approach to their answers and contributions to this place. 

Premier, you have the call.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the member for his question. He has had some memory loss in recent times, forgetting his comments back in 2015. The idea comes from you.  Clearly you want to maximise the profits from GBEs which can only mean two things: one, sacking workers within GBEs, and two, increasing fees and charges for Tasmanians.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - When this government has reached in and supported Tasmanians during a cost-of-living crisis, which is a global and national crisis, what you want to do is jack up fees and charges. That is your plan, Mr Winter.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. Contributions from the members on my left who do not have the call will cease.
Bridgewater Bridge - Opening Cost

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.05 a.m.]
In the words of Saul Eslake, Tasmanians will be hurt as a result of your budget disaster. He says you have damaged the finances so severely that the real question is who gets hurt and by how much?

One of the reasons for this mess is waste: the amount of money wasted on bungled ship projects, near energy blackouts and other failed projects. You are currently preparing to sell assets and have a hiring freeze on critical public sector workers like child safety workers. Are you aware that, at the same time, your government is about to waste almost $100 000 for an event planner for the opening of the Bridgewater bridge? Do you do you endorse such an extravagant use of taxpayer money during a budget crisis?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left. Order, Mr Willie.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. All roles are being reviewed at this present time to ensure we do address the budget circumstances and the challenges that we have. That is what measured and sensible governments do. What we will not do is sack nurses, sack police, and put hospital beds in storage like you did in the 2011 budget. We remember that well.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We will continue growing the economy -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Member for Lyons - sorry, member for Franklin.  I am having a bit of a day. It is because I had to call so many of you yesterday. Member for Franklin, you are warned.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The National Australia Bank survey only yesterday pointed to confidence -

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker.  The question was quite specific.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Excuse me. Stop the clock. The Leader of the Opposition has every right to raise a point of order. Deep sighing from members on my right is also absolutely unacceptable today.
Mr WINTER - Is the Premier aware that his government is planning to spend $100 000 on a Bridgewater bridge opening?  Does he endorse that use of taxpayer funds?

The SPEAKER - The point of order is clearly about relevance. I draw the Premier to the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I believe I answered in my first couple of sentences where we are reviewing all matters pertaining to expenditure and roles to ensure that we have the right size public service.

The SPEAKER - The Premier has answered the question. He has the opportunity to resume his seat.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Notwithstanding the good and exciting project that the Bridgewater bridge is, this government made the call and the decision to build. Your government squibbed it. We are building the Bridgewater bridge. We have rebuilt the Royal Hobart Hospital and your government could not lay a brick.

As I look at schools around Tasmania -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER -Members on my left. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - the schools around Tasmania that were falling down around students’ and teachers' ears in 2014 were upgraded. As Education minister, I travelled the state visiting all schools and we are rebuilding those schools. We are building new schools at Legana, Brighton, and Penguin on the north-west coast. We have invested $11 million in Latrobe High and $11 million in Devonport High School, $11 million in Parklands High School and $11 million in Smithton. Across Tasmania we are reinvesting in school infrastructure.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The shadow treasurer and member for Clark, Mr Willie, is warned.

Mr ROCKLIFF - With sensible and measured budget management, not sacking frontline nurses like you lot did, we will have a pathway to surplus. We have a very clear plan to do so. Your only plan is to rack up fees and charges and hurt Tasmanians in a cost-of-living crisis.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - Honourable Speaker, a supplementary question?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - In relation to the Bridgewater bridge $100,000 spend, the tender was awarded on 13 January this year. Is the Premier saying that that tender is now under review by his government through its budget cuts?

The SPEAKER - It does arise from the answer that the Premier gave in the first few moments before spending the next three minutes on the question. I will call the Premier to the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the member for his question. We will endeavour to ensure that we spend scarce taxpayer dollars wisely and for good reason. A wise investment is teachers in our schools, nurses in our hospitals, and police on the beat. A wise investment is to ensure that we are building public and affordable housing to support Tasmanians with that fundamental right to be safe and have a roof over their heads.


Salmon Industry - Mass Mortality Crisis

Ms BURNET question to MINISTER for the ENVIRONMENT, Ms OGILVIE

[10.11 a.m.]
Just in February, well over a million full-grown salmon have died in a mass mortality event in Tasmanian waters. We know rendering and other facilities are overwhelmed and unable to cope. These diseased salmon are being dumped. The Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) has reported the landfill sites they regulate are being used to take dead salmon, but also that non-compliant dumping is occurring. We have reports that salmon and salmon offal are being dumped on private land at St. Peters Pass and Crown land elsewhere.

Can you confirm whether these fish are being dumped at any sites the EPA does not regulate? Will you provide the House with information about where illegal and other dumping is occurring?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. It is a very important issue. We are all very aware of the issues that we have had in the salmon industry over the past few weeks, and we have discussed many of those in this Chamber.

I am aware that a briefing is being provided today by the EPA and others to your party and others. I am sure you will be able to ask those questions directly at that table.

However, I will say that the EPA's regulation and its role as an independent environmental regulator does provide that comprehensive environmental monitoring including cross waste and regulation of our salmon industries. We do know that mortalities are a known aspect of salmon farming worldwide and can be experienced during the production cycle. We have seen those high rates of mortality. The high water temperatures, disease, and jellyfish impacts have occurred and, from an environmental perspective, the critical issue is timely collection and management of mortality waste in an approved manner.

The EPA requires aquaculture companies to report any suspected or known incidents of disease or mortality affecting greater than 0.25 per cent of fish per day for three consecutive days or greater than 0.5 per cent on any one day in any individual fish pen.

Of course, as we all have in this Chamber, I acknowledge community concerns at this very difficult time, and I also acknowledge the challenging situation that salmon companies themselves have been dealing with due to the high number of mortalities occurring within a short period of time.

The EPA has been rolling out new environmental licence conditions as set out in the government's environmental standards for Tasmanian marine fish farming, that require reporting of the combined weight of deceased fish arising from marine fish farms each month. The first of these reports is expected mid-March 2025, with companies in all regions expected to be reporting monthly by May. 

These conditions also require deceased fish to be removed from pens as soon as practical. Being a controlled waste, transporters of mortality waste must be registered with the EPA and the mortality waste must be taken to a site that is approved to receive it.

I have not been advised of any of the sites to which you refer, but I will look into those. As I have said, I understand that you are having a briefing today with the EPA, where you can ask that question directly. 

Supplementary Question

Ms BURNET - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question from the member.

Ms BURNET - Thank you. I appreciate the minister is suggesting that there is a briefing today, but I am requesting that the minister answer the question and bring that information to the House. We need transparency and we know that there is regulation around this, so [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.8_D=7.3_C=0.62] , it is important that the House hear. I wonder if - 

The SPEAKER - The time for restating the question has expired. The supplementary is in order as it arises from the answer that you gave.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=33.8_D=5.0_C=0.86] The question is whether or not you will be updating the House on that information when you receive it, minister.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=41.3_D=19.8_C=0.68] Ms OGILVIE - Certainly. Post the briefing today, I am sure we can provide an update. 

Ms BURNET - You are taking it on notice. 

The SPEAKER - Thank you. I am just confirming that we will get an update. I think we are still waiting for a couple of the updates from yesterday too. Just to put that on the record. I have not seen the Hansard yet, but I will check with the minister. 


 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=63.0_D=1.4_C=0.76] Spirit of Tasmania Vessels - Future Arrangements

Mrs PENTLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF
 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=67.9_D=1.1_C=0.61] 
[10.16 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=70.1_D=29.2_C=0.80] Last week, I used my MPI to debate the future of the Spirits and invited both sides of the House to put forward ideas about what the two new ships will be used for when they are back in Tasmania. It appears that both the government and the opposition have given up on the idea of recouping precious funds by leasing the vessels, but unfortunately no alternative suggestions were put forward. Are you actively considering local tourism options or will we simply have two  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=99.6_D=4.1_C=0.70] half-billion-dollar floating ornaments that can be seen but not touched?

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=105.6_D=3.0_C=0.21]  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=113.3_D=23.3_C=0.73] ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. It allows me to expand a bit on yesterday's question around leasing Spirit V. I said that it is unlikely that Spirit V would be leased -

Mr Winter - You over-ruled the Transport minister. That is what you did. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - No -

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=137.8_D=17.2_C=0.56] The SPEAKER - Order. It is the member for Bass, Mrs Pentland's question. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - because of the timeframe and the market really wants a two-year timeframe and the like. It is unlikely that someone would come forward with a very generous offer for a six-month lease. Should they do that, of course it would be prudent to [Bookmark: Phr12_O=155.6_D=26.8_C=0.86]  investigate that but extremely unlikely in that event. 

In terms of bringing the two vessels to Tasmania, obviously there is fit-out required and I welcome all the ideas from many Tasmanians, in particular, regarding opportunities for the vessels to provide some return while they are here.  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=183.4_D=0.8_C=0.49] I have seen many  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=186.2_D=1.8_C=0.63] ideas for tours around Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr15_O=188.4_D=12.1_C=0.77] , around Bruny Island, and all sorts of ideas which we welcome. I am proud of the fact that Tasmanians are so engaged in this subject [Bookmark: Phr16_O=202.1_D=0.6_C=0.94]  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=205.5_D=29.4_C=0.77] , which highlights the fact that Tasmania care passionately about this significant Tasmanian investment and asset. 

The difficulty we have regarding tourism is that my understanding is, once you put one tourist on the vessel, because of Australian maritime law - I will call it - and other Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) requirements, if that is the right terminology, you would have to crew the ship to its maximum crew capacity, which is 78. That would not be a value [Bookmark: Phr19_O=249.0_D=10.3_C=0.79]  proposition for the Tasmanian taxpayer, in my opinion.

There are very good reasons and complications around why some of these ideas cannot [Bookmark: Phr20_O=261.2_D=4.1_C=0.78]  be thought about. We still welcome ideas from [Bookmark: Phr21_O=265.8_D=21.1_C=0.78]  Tasmanians and others. I know that the TT-Line board is doing their due diligence on opportunities as well, which of course we welcome. I sincerely welcome the appointment of chair, Ken Kanofski, who is doing an outstanding job.

Government Business Enterprises - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr O'BYRNE question to MINISTER for TRANSPORT, Mr ABETZ 

[10.20 a.m.]
Your government dropped a bombshell last week in the state of the state address, lining up GBEs and state-owned companies for privatisation. While this announcement may have provided  [Bookmark: Phr1_O=0.1_D=30.0_C=0.75] some breathing space for yourself as minister and Metro management, every day Tasmanians are being let down by a public transport provider that continually fails to meet the most basic of standards expected of it. We still have no news of when the ridiculously titled 'temporary service adjustment' will be resolved.
Eighteen months on, there are still 150 buses a day permanently cancelled in Hobart. We are hearing of school children and communities stranded  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=19.6_C=0.74] on the side of the road, and those Tasmanians with a choice have simply walked away and back into their cars. Your ill-fated privatisation folly does not excuse you of your responsibility to ensure Tasmanians have a functioning public transport system. What actions are you taking to restore confidence in Metro and public transport?

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=51.1_D=29.5_C=0.77] ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, there are two aspects to the member's question. The first is in relation to the government's scoping of the GBEs and state-owned corporations to ascertain how they can best serve the people of Tasmania. That is a question that no person and no government should be scared to ask. We, as a government,  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=80.8_D=28.9_C=0.84] are willing to ask the question: how can these entities best serve the people of Tasmania?

Metro is one of those GBEs. Yes, we will consider how Metro can best serve the people of Tasmania. As the member would know as a former transport minister, if I recall correctly, there are some services that are actually provided by Kinetic, Tassie Link and other private providers [Bookmark: Phr5_O=109.9_D=14.0_C=0.81]  - something which, whilst he was a minister, he was willing to fund. 

I say to the member, and to this House, that it is possible to have a private provider  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=125.0_D=15.7_C=0.91] producing a service that meets the needs of the Tasmanian people. We are willing to look at that. 

In relation to the specific question of the member, which relates to the shortage ultimately of drivers,  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=141.1_D=25.6_C=0.84] I remind the member, Speaker, and through you, the House, that there is a 25,000 driver shortage right around Australia as we speak. Tasmania unfortunately is not immune from that. Basically, anybody who wants to be a driver in Australia can put up their hand and get a job tomorrow.  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=167.9_D=3.0_C=0.83] 

Metro, to their credit, is advertising,  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=171.2_D=25.8_C=0.78] training and doing the very best to get as many drivers as possible on board to ensure that those services that unfortunately needed to be dropped because of a lack of drivers can be taken up again. As I understand it, some of those services are being resumed, but not as much as we would like.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=197.8_D=9.8_C=0.77] There is a driver shortage, which Metro is dealing with, and I add, a lot of other companies are dealing with as well.  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=208.3_D=27.8_C=0.86] Metro is doing their best in this regard. I ask them continually, when I meet with Metro board and management on a regular basis, what is happening with the driver shortage. They point out to me all the steps that they are taking, including fast tracking applicants to get the appropriate licences to be able to drive the buses that are needed for the provision of public transport.


 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=243.3_D=15.5_C=0.83] TasTAFE - Staffing Concerns

Ms BADGER question to MINISTER for SKILLS and TRAINING, Mr ELLIS

[10.24 a.m.]  
TasTAFE is falling apart on your watch. VET student numbers are down, the statutory 30-month TAFE review has not commenced, the Campbell St automotive department has been flooded, and you have not bothered to future-proof the industry with an alternative southern facility.  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=259.1_D=29.8_C=0.84] Workplace morale is at an all-time low, with many on stress leave. We have heard directly about bullying complaints and allegations of unfair dismissal. 

In recent days, we have heard teachers will be made redundant. Yesterday, it was revealed the CEO has quit. What role have you had in all of this? Did you provide any direction or instruction to the TAFE CEO or board to reduce staff numbers? If so, what size reduction? What was the board and CEO's response? Did clashes with you over this issue contribute to the CEO's  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=289.1_D=1.4_C=0.26] departure? 

The SPEAKER - I am still writing down the question, minister.

Mr Ellis - There are quite a few in there, Speaker.

The SPEAKER - Actually no, the roles and  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=298.4_D=6.3_C=0.69] what direction you took, what size, their response and - can I just get the last part of the question?

Ms BADGER - Did clashes with you over this issue contribute to the CEO's departure?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, the short answer is no. We have had a wonderful working relationship with the CEO of TasTAFE. He has done an incredible job guiding TAFE through the journey that it has been on so that we can put the learner at the centre of everything - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left. I need to hear the answer to see if it is relevant.

Mr ELLIS - that we do at TasTAFE and that we can ensure that TAFE looks more like the businesses that it serves. 

Mr Dreher has resigned and taken up an opportunity interstate. We wish him really well. We left on great terms and he has been a phenomenal servant of the learners of Tasmania over this journey. I reject any characterisation of that and thank him from the bottom of my heart for all the work that he has done. 

On the specifics of TasTAFE Automotive, you are right, we have had an unfortunate issue with a burst TasWater main that has flooded the lower levels of the Campbell Street campus. That is no one's fault, but it is something we need to work through diligently so that we can continue to provide the services for apprentices and learners in the automotive sector in the south. We are standing up significant short-term and long-term support for those learners so that we can continue to get them through their apprenticeships. 

Regarding short-term support: we are providing important new, innovative training in workplaces, so training and assessment can be done in the workplaces that we have in the south so that learners are assessed in their everyday work site. That is really important. It is an innovative delivery model that we want to move to more broadly and provide those opportunities for people. Out of what is a really unfortunate situation, there are some good opportunities. 

We thank our partners in the Department of Education, Children and Young People for making available trades training centres in the south at Huonville and Bridgewater for our learners in automotive. There may be other opportunities with other partners too. For some learners in automotive in the south, they will be learning closer to home in some of those areas, which is really encouraging. It also shows that there are good opportunities when we work across government to provide services to those learners. 

In certain circumstances, learners may need to travel. Travel and transport subsidies are available just as they are for learners from the north and north-west who need to come down -

Dr Woodruff - Sixteen-year-olds going to Launceston to do automotive.

The SPEAKER - Order, Leader of the Greens. The question was from Ms Badger.

Mr ELLIS - to the south to learn in some of our facilities, noting that the majority of automotive apprentices are in the north and north-west.

Members interjecting.

Mr ELLIS - More broadly, in the long term - it is true. The long-term work that we are doing, we are working closely with the Tasmania Automotive Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TACC) on futureproofing the regional southern training facility and opportunities for learners. Obviously, we have been very focused on delivering the short-term solutions so that we can back in those learners. We always have an eye to the long term.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired. 

Supplementary Question

Ms BADGER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will take the supplementary question from the member for Lyons.

Ms BADGER - When TasTAFE was transitioned to its new operating model, your government promised 'no existing TasTAFE employee will be worse off and that there will be no forced redundancies'. We understand that they are happening as of today. 

My question was: did you provide any direction or instruction to the TasTAFE CEO or board to reduce staff numbers? 

The SPEAKER - I will call the minister to the question as it was the original question. 

Mr ELLIS - My answer was no. More broadly, in terms of the work that TasTAFE is doing with staff in the automotive space in the south, we are working through a process and the facility closure is a difficult one. I understand that voluntary redundancies have been an offer that has been made, but with other options available, including redeployment, for staff. I understand that TasTAFE will continue to work with staff in this difficult circumstance so that we can get the right outcome for staff and learners as part of it.

More broadly, our government has been hugely committed to increasing the workforce at TasTAFE. It was the Labor-Greens opposition that blew up TasTAFE. It was our government that put it back together and delivered more than 70 new teachers for TasTAFE.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left, including the member who asked the question. 

Mr ELLIS - We back in tradies. Many of us have worked in that industry. Many of us have gone to TasTAFE. One of us has even taught at TasTAFE. We support our vocational education learners and the Greens do not.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired. The minister will resume his seat.


TasPorts - Proposal for Privatisation 

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.30 a.m.]
You have wrecked Tasmania's budget and are planning mass privatisations in a panicked attempt to cover up your mess. Part of the plan involves privatising TasPorts, something you ruled out just four months ago. This will be a disaster for Tasmania, as it has been in other states.

In New South Wales, the Liberals secretly included clauses in the port sale contract which effectively prevented any competition to Port Botany for nearly 100 years. It seriously damaged Newcastle's economy, put up prices for everyday items across New South Wales and hurt exporters.

In the Northern Territory, the port was placed in foreign ownership, something roundly criticised by both sides of politics, and even the former US President, as a major national security mistake.

Will you rule out Tasmanian ports going to foreign ownership or including any anti-competitive conditions in a planned sale?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Thank you. The Premier will hold his answer and the clock will stop. Conversations between the Deputy Premier and the Leader of the Opposition Business across the Chamber do not make it easy for me to hear if the answer has been given. Given that at some stage I am sure you are going to jump on a relevance or a supplementary question, it would be good if I could hear the answer. The Premier has the call.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I have said many times over the course of the last few weeks since the state of the state address, about having a very sensible and measured look at what assets we can keep in Tasmanian government hands and what we can offload and invest into a future fund to offset debt and looking at all GBEs in a very sensible and measured way.

I would have thought that the member, given his past comments, would believe in that, because, before you put your toe into the water around electricity asset sales in Victoria, you said, 'Look, there is no doubt and all the research shows that, for example -

Mr Ellis - All of it.

The SPEAKER - Mr Ellis, thank you.

Mr ROCKLIFF - gee, this is going to get me in trouble. I am a member of the ALP but anyway'.

Then you went on to the electricity assets privatised in Victoria but, to your credit, you made a very good attempt of cleaning it up yesterday in a media conference. I thought it was a very notable performance. It was fantastic, actually.

Mr WINTER - Honourable Speaker, a point of order, Standing Order 45, relevance.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my right. I instructed the member not to interject so that points of order could be made, if appropriate. When he does so, you can all be quiet.

I will hear the point of order.

Mr WINTER - As much as I was enjoying the rerun from yesterday, the question is specifically around TasPorts, honourable Speaker. Could you draw the Premier back to the question?

The SPEAKER - There was a preamble that talked about privatisation. The question, Premier, was about TasPorts, if I can draw you to the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, because it is about our plan and the Leader's plan and who believes in privatisation and who does not. You made it very clear yesterday. You said, 'My position remains the same. We do not support privatisation'. In 2015 you did not support asset sales -
Mr Winter - Four months ago you said you would not privatise it. You ruled out privatisation four months ago.

The SPEAKER - Order, Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ROCKLIFF - My position around asset sales has always been the same: that I do not believe that this is the right thing for Tasmania.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The Deputy Leader is seeking the call. Members on my right will be quiet so I can hear her.

Ms DOW - Point of order, Standing Order 45, it is about relevance. This is about TasPorts. It is about selling off TasPorts. We want an answer from the Premier. He is going nowhere near the question.

The SPEAKER - Thank you very much. The member will resume her seat.

Premier, I will call you again to the question. There are 12 seconds left. Please address it so we avoid the supplementary.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you, member. I do not have time right now to read the entire transcript -

The SPEAKER - No, you do not because the Premier's time has expired, and I am hearing potentially a supplementary question, not unexpected.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - It is the same question: will the Premier rule out placing Tasmanian ports in foreign ownership or including any anti-competitive clauses in a planned sale?

The SPEAKER - Thank you. That is a very precise supplementary, which was the original question. I will draw the Premier to it in the hope we can move on to other matters.

Mr ROCKLIFF - My understanding is that a past Labor government tried to sell off the Hobart Ports Corporation and, of course, did sell the Hobart Airport, but this is very important because we need to know where the alternative premier stands on these matters.

Mr Winter - Where do you stand? We are asking you.

Mr ROCKLIFF - After you said it is the right thing for Tasmania, a reporter said, 'Hang on. So you are saying in a 2015 interview' -

The SPEAKER - Do you have a point of order, member for Bass? Thank you, Premier, I am trying to hear the point of order. Members on my right -

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, Standing Order 45, relevance.

The SPEAKER - Thank you. I will accept the relevance point of order, and call the Premier to the question. Thank you, minister Ellis.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I have answered in terms of having a very measured and sensible look at what asset sales can be kept in Tasmania hands and ones that we can offload and put in our future fund.

The member quotes Saul Eslake in his first couple of questions, so when Saul comes back with recommendations, what are you going to do?

Time expired.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Thank you. I have the opportunity, if members have answered the question or are not going to, to ask them to resume their seat so as to move to the next question. I would rather not have to do that because I think getting further information is useful. 


TasNetworks - Extension of Time for Network Outage Review

Mr GARLAND question MINISTER for ENERGY and RENEWABLES, Mr DUIGAN

[10.36 a.m.]
In September last year, Labor and the crossbench supported my motion for an independent review into the response to the major storm outage by TasNetworks. This issue reared its head again yesterday when storms and lightning left around 30,000 customers and businesses without power in the north-west. I met with the independent reviewer last month and understand he needs more time to consider some of the issues raised in the review. It is important this review is thorough and ensures TasNetworks and the government is well placed to respond to future storm events, so I support this request. Would the government consider an additional month for the review to be completed?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. I am pleased to provide the House with an update on the independent network outage review.

First, it should be remembered the scale of that event last year in August and September, and the scale of the recovery effort across TasNetworks and other agencies. At its peak, 47,000 electricity customers were disconnected, with more than 200,000 supply restorations being undertaken. The member mentioned in his question, yesterday's event, which was in and of itself a large event - 30,000 customers without power for a period of time after something like 17,000 lightning strikes across the state. I am advised that at 9 a.m. this morning around 56 active outages were being attended to with 1700 customers still affected, and we are working on getting those attended to.

The government takes very seriously the motion put forward by the member and agreed to by parliament, calling for an independent review, noting that TasNetworks would also conduct an inquiry into how it responded. It is essential that our agency seek learning to ensure they are well prepared to respond to future extreme weather events. Yesterday, was a good case in point. The independent network outage review will help us understand what worked well, and also where there are areas for improvement.
In early December last year, I announced Mr Rhys Edwards would be conducting the independent review. Mr Edwards has a strong background in governance, energy policy and public administration, has been the secretary of the Department of Premier and Cabinet (DPAC) and is currently a board member of Aurora Energy. The terms of reference were also released.

As referenced in your question, member for Braddon, Mr Edwards was asked to extend the deadline for submissions from 30 January 2025 to 16 February 2025. I am advised that Mr Edwards has met with a key range of parties to discuss their experiences, including councils and the State Emergency Service (SES). If it pleases the House, the government will extend the review by a month, as suggested by the member for Braddon, to ensure it can complete a thorough and comprehensive look at the impact and take into account the holiday period in terms of the timelines.

I will be making the report of the independent review publicly available and look forward to sharing its findings with my parliamentary colleagues. 


Budget Repair Plan 2025-26

Ms JOHNSTON question to TREASURER, Mr BARNETT

[10.40 a.m.]
Saul Eslake is highly sceptical about asset sales being an effective budget repair measure. Tasmania should be rightly wary of your intentions after hiring Mr Eslake to conduct your review of a GBE sell-off. You basically ignored the last report he did for you. You also ignored the report you commissioned from another economist you respect, Dr Nicholas Gruen.

Is the GBE review another sham? Will you ignore Mr Eslake again? Will your 2025-26 budget include and rely upon revenue from a GBE sell-off? If it does not, what is your plan B for budget repair in 2025-26?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, it is a very important matter in terms of the government's plan, because we have a plan. We have a plan to back industry, back business, and grow our economy. The state of the state address by the Premier was clear. It outlined that plan: cutting red tape, the right size of the public service, and GBE reform, which commenced last November.

It has been an ongoing process. We are working very closely with business and industry. I want to put on the record my thanks to Saul Eslake for his contribution last year, and again this year, and the ongoing work with our state government regarding the fiscal strategy.
Mr Winter - Did you hear what he said about it?

The SPEAKER - Order, Leader.

Mr BARNETT - In your question you made reference to that. We stand by it. It is very important.

It is a 10-year strategy. We have plans to work, as the Premier said, consistently, methodically and carefully, to a pathway to surplus. We will continue to do that. We do not support Mr Eslake's call for an increase in taxes. This is something that as a government we took to the election and we stand by that. We want to back business, back industry.

The only party that has gone public on this regarding the response to the Premier's state of the state address is the Leader for the Opposition. He has made it very clear he wants to hike up taxes and charges on Tasmanians, in fact more than six times, based on modelling that has been undertaken. It is more than six times for bus fares, and for those costs for electricity, and for simply going to the Port Arthur historic site. This is a very big concern because you have nearly $130 million -

Mr Willie - You are falling flat with this. You are going nowhere.

The SPEAKER - Shadow treasurer, you have been warned before.

Mr BARNETT - that comes to the government outside of Hydro profits. This is Labor's plan. This is a concern for us as a government. 

With respect to Mr Eslake, and as referred to in your question, I look forward to working with Mr Eslake with respect to the review of our government business enterprises. We will go through this in a methodical, sensible, careful way, with careful analysis. We will get the feedback from Saul Eslake. I am looking forward to sharing that with members, not only the member for Clark, but with all members, once we have that information. We need to do a thorough, comprehensive review. I am looking forward to that and getting on with the job.

Time expired.

Supplementary Question

Ms JOHNSTON - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I am not surprised to hear a supplementary from the member for Clark.

Ms JOHNSTON - My original question was: will your 2025-26 budget include and rely on revenue from GBE sell-offs? If it does not include that, what is your plan B for budget repair in 2025-26?

The SPEAKER - I draw the Treasurer to the original question.

Mr BARNETT - With respect to the budget, which is due on 29 May, there is a lot of work that has gone into that already. We have received hundreds of submissions during the budget consultation process, which started back in December. We have reviewed those and we have worked with our various departments and secretaries.

There is a lot of hard work that goes into that. I will have more to say on 29 May as we outline our plans to deliver a budget surplus. Those plans will make it clear that we are backing business, we are backing industry, and we are creating more jobs in this state. This is on the back of fantastic news yesterday with business confidence in Australia highest in the state of Tasmania. That is an indicator that we are on the right track and heading in the right direction. I will have more to say. I look forward to full scrutiny by this parliament through Budget Estimates and the normal process.

Ms FINLAY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF
 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=33.5_D=15.0_C=0.81] 
[10.45 a.m.]
Investments made by Tasmanian Irrigation, a proud Labor initiative, have driven massive productivity gains across the agriculture sector. Pretty much all the schemes delivered to this point have been the ones that with the most straightforward commercial advantages, or to use an agriculture term, all the low-hanging fruit.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=48.7_D=21.0_C=0.73] The Tamar scheme will deliver huge benefits for our farmers in the north and could underpin massive development opportunities at Bell Bay. Unfortunately it has missed water sales targets twice. To succeed to deliver long-term returns it needs the certainty of long-term public investment. How will this occur if you privatise Tasmanian Irrigation?

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=77.8_D=6.1_C=0.77] ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I appreciate the question, mentioning privatisation once again, leading with the chin once again. I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition has given up asking questions around privatisation today,  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=99.2_D=9.1_C=0.76] for fear of what might be repeated back to him about his performance of great clarity [Bookmark: Phr9_O=109.3_D=15.2_C=0.77]  in opposition yesterday in the media. I will come to the answer. It is a very important question. On the subject of privatisation, we all need to be scrutinised [Bookmark: Phr10_O=124.7_D=29.8_C=0.73]  in this place. A reporter said yesterday to Mr Winter, 'Hang on, so you are saying in that 2015 interview when you talk about Victorian energy assets being sold' -

Ms FINLAY - Point of order, Speaker.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Premier. I will hear the point of order from the member Bass.

Ms FINLAY - Standing Order 45, relevance. I asked the question of the Premier about something important to the Tamar farmers and to Bell Bay producers. Could you please answer my question through the Speaker to me?

The SPEAKER - Thank you. Member for Bass, resume your seat. Premier, I draw you to what was actually quite a specific question.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=155.7_D=22.6_C=0.76] Mr ROCKLIFF - Yes. I am coming to the question through my answer.

The SPEAKER - Please do so as quickly as you can.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Victorian energy assets being sold are doing better in private hands. You are saying you did not support privatisation? This is the reporter - Mr Winter said 'What I am saying is that Tasmanian Labor does not support privatisation'.

Members interjecting.
Ms FINLAY - Point of order, Standing Order 45, relevance.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=180.4_D=16.0_C=0.57] The SPEAKER - Premier, I will hear another point of order on relevance. 

Ms FINLAY - Thank you very much. 

The SPEAKER - Thank you. You do not get to put the argument again. Premier, I have called you to the specific question. I appreciate your having fun, but Question Time is about eliciting answers.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=196.7_D=21.8_C=0.82] Mr ROCKLIFF - I am coming to the answer and very quickly. It is important. The reporter did a very good job of scrutiny yesterday. The reporter said, 'So sorry, just to confirm it is Labor's position that your position at the time was that you did support some privatisation'. Mr Winter said -

Ms Finlay - Point of order.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=220.3_D=2.7_C=0.78] The SPEAKER - Premier, I am hearing a third point of order.  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=224.9_D=3.2_C=0.78] Many points of order do not necessarily get us to where we want to be. I am assuming it is Standing Order 45, relevance?

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=228.5_D=17.7_C=0.78] Ms FINLAY - Absolutely relevance.

The SPEAKER - Thank you. I will take the point of order on relevance. Premier, I will call you to the question. Otherwise if you are not wanting to answer it, you can resume your seat. You have 22 seconds. Please answer it now.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you. I will answer it right now.

Mr Winter said, 'Of course, my position at the time is on the record'.  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=247.4_D=29.8_C=0.72] Was that not a great clearing up of the position.

The SPEAKER - The member will resume her seat and the Premier will resume his seat as well. Quite frankly, if we are going to treat Question Time with such disrespect, I will sit members down the moment they stray from the actual question that has been asked.


Protection of High Conservation Value Forest

Dr WOODRUFF question to MINISTER for BUSINESS, INDUSTRY and RESOURCES, Mr ABETZ

[10.49 a.m.]
Over the summer, we met with locals from Lilydale, Golconda, the Fingal Valley, and St Marys. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=277.6_D=25.5_C=0.84]  These are communities adjacent to protected high conservation value forests that you plan to convert for logging and burning. One of the threatened lots is home to the iconic PANAMA music festival, held last weekend. The thousands of music and forest lovers there were shocked when they heard of your plans. PANAMA organisers and worried Lilydale locals have written to you and Forestry Tasmania for answers, only to be fobbed off.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=303.8_D=1.0_C=0.46] Of the 27 lots you are focusing on trashing, you have chosen five to be first. You were due to receive a report detailing the five most suitable parcels for Future Potential Production Forest (FPPF) land for conversion to Permanent Timber Bush Zones (PTBZ) by last December. Will you be transparent with Tasmanians and let them know which forest you are planning on destroying?  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.6_D=4.4_C=0.81] Have you received this report? If so, will you table it in parliament?

Mr Ellis - It has to come back to parliament.

The SPEAKER - I remind minister Ellis to stop helping.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=32.8_D=4.3_C=0.52]  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=38.3_D=24.3_C=0.82] ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, the question by the Leader of the Greens shows a complete ignorance of the way this is going to work, if it does work. Any proposed lot for harvesting will need to come before this parliament. Therefore, there is no secrecy about it. There is nothing. Of course,  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=63.0_D=12.4_C=0.66] when your task in life is to be the ventriloquist doll for the multi-million-dollar non-taxpaying Bob Brown Foundation and wanting to raise funds for that organisation  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=75.7_D=14.9_C=0.88] to assist your own political cause, you will ask loaded questions of that nature to try to get more donations and scare people. That is something I find absolutely reprehensible.  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=90.8_D=5.8_C=0.79] 

As a leader of a political party, the Leader of the Greens should be  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=97.8_D=25.6_C=0.82] understanding the situation, not concerning people - not only unnecessarily, but might I suggest, deliberately, to assist with the fundraising and the political cause. Let us make no mistake, when we stop native forestry, as Labor has done in Victoria and Queensland,  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=123.9_D=8.2_C=0.84] what do we see? A mass import of hardwood from around the world, logged in the Solomon Islands, [Bookmark: Phr10_O=132.3_D=30.0_C=0.78]  Malaysia, and South America.

Dr Woodruff - Honourable Speaker, point of order, Standing Order 45, relevance. It was a specific question about the report that the minister was to have received in December for five lots. Will he please table that to parliament and provide communities with the information?

SPEAKER - I will take the point of order. I will remind you it is much easier if you wait for me to give you the call before launching into the point of order. I will draw the minister to the question.

Mr ABETZ - Thank you, Speaker. Can I remind the Leader of the Greens that there was a huge amount  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=162.5_D=27.1_C=0.78] of other verbiage around her question and I am seeking to answer those specifics. If there was one specific question, I could answer that, but when a whole host of allegations are made, it is right and proper that those allegations, especially when they are false, are answered and the record is corrected. That is what I am seeking to do in relation to the matters that  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=190.5_D=1.8_C=0.55] the member has raised.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=192.9_D=15.0_C=0.82] Will I receive a report? Yes, I will. Have I received it as yet? No, I have not. Will I table it? The tabling of these matters will be at a time if the government makes a determination.  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=208.0_D=26.0_C=0.74] As we said at the time, a determination on these particular wood lots would be determined on the economics of it, the environmental considerations of it, the certification of all the other matters - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question, but there were three answers just then.

Dr WOODRUFF - Thank you, minister, for confirming that you have not yet received that report. Can you please tell us when you expect to receive it, since it is late?

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=235.2_D=5.6_C=0.56] The SPEAKER - I will draw the minister to it as it arose out of his answer. I draw the minister to the question.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=242.0_D=24.5_C=0.60] Mr ABETZ - In due course.

Dr Woodruff - So much disdain.

The SPEAKER - Order, Leader of the Greens.


Community and Neighbourhood Houses - Funding

Mr JENNER question to MINISTER for COMMUNITY SERVICES, Mr JAENSCH 

[10.54 a.m.]
Last week in my reply to the state of the state speech, several community and Neighbourhood Houses in Lyons  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=267.3_D=4.4_C=0.73] were forced to turn people away or limit food distribution before Christmas  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=272.1_D=2.4_C=0.91] due to lack of funds and resources.  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=275.7_D=24.6_C=0.80] Although I acknowledge the additional funding the government provided for these communities last year and can assure you the support was greatly appreciated, this additional funding needs to be made ongoing and should not be just a one-off payment. These facilities offer a vital service to Tasmanians during their toughest times, and they need ongoing, reliable funding to continue their important work.  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=301.1_D=3.8_C=0.86] I know the minister supports these community services, but will this government commit to more funding for these community hubs so they can continue to provide the invaluable service they do?
ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question, interest and support for our neighbourhood and community houses right around the state and the valuable roles that they perform in our community. There is no greater supporter of Neighbourhood Houses and community houses in Tasmania than this Liberal government. We recognise the houses as key pillars of healthy, supportive and inclusive communities. For over a decade now, our government has supported the houses.

In our latest budget we have boosted funding another $50,000 a year for the next three years for each of the 34 houses, so that they can continue delivering for Tasmanians in their local communities; more funding for the place-based Community Connector Program for Neighbourhood Houses for ongoing employment for the existing 11 community connectors and to begin a staged expansion from 2025-26; $6 million in new capital funding over the next three years to ensure all houses are fit for purpose and contemporary; providing $150,000 for the Hood in the Hub Community Garden initiative at the Warrane-Mornington Neighbourhood Centre, and an additional $74,000 each year for four years to Phoenix Neighbourhood House on King Island.

Our government also recognises the role that Neighbourhood Houses play, as you point out, in the Tasmanian food system and will be consulting closely with Neighbourhood Houses Tasmania and individual houses as part of the development of a whole-of-government strategy to continue the shift from emergency food relief to food resilience. In that context, every one of our Neighbourhood Houses responds to the particular needs of its local community and the services it can partner with and leverage to deliver for them. Each of our houses plays a different role in this food space. Some of them have community gardens where they are growing food, working with members of the community to prepare food, and distribute it or provide it through eating with friends, or meals with friends type programs in their houses. Others receive food from organisations like Loaves and Fishes, in which our government is also investing heavily.

Every place will be different. We will work with any of our houses through Neighbourhood Houses Tasmania and in partnership with organisations like Loaves and Fishes to ensure that they have the supplies to meet the needs of their local community, which may be different in different places and the delivery may be in different ways.

We have always supported our neighbourhood houses. We see them as part of our Food Relief to Resilience Strategy, and also an integral part of our new 20-year preventative health strategy for which public consultation has been open since last October. Health forums will be run in Launceston and Devonport and Hobart next week. I encourage everyone to register.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired.


Dr Peter Renshaw - Criminal Investigation

Ms ROSOL question to MINISTER for POLICE, FIRE and EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Mr ELLIS

[10.59 a.m.]
Last June, an investigation into death reporting practices at the LGH found that Dr Peter Renshaw had engaged in a repeated pattern of breaking the law. The matter was referred to Tasmania Police. Early this year, police revealed that they would not press charges in relation to this matter. That decision surprised and distressed many.

We have spoken with key witnesses to Dr Renshaw's conduct. They say they were never interviewed by Tasmanian police. They are wondering how thoroughly this matter was looked at. To get more information about what happened, we wrote in good faith to the Police Commissioner in January to request a briefing. We are still yet to receive a reply. Tasmanians deserve to know what happened here. Did Tasmania Police conduct an actual investigation of this matter, and if so, what steps did they take, or did they simply do a desktop review of the information provided to them by the review?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question on this very important topic and I will follow up regards the correspondence.

In terms of broader information, Dr Peter Renshaw, who is the Director of Medical Services at the Launceston General Hospital, was a witness and a person of interest during the Commission of Inquiry into the Tasmanian Government's Response to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings. In 2023 during a parliamentary inquiry into the Launceston General Hospital, allegations were made in relation to Dr Renshaw's falsifying death certificates in matters that should have been referred to the Coroner. A review into this matter was conducted independently by the Department of Health and the results were referred to Tasmania Police to consider or instigate a criminal investigation. All available evidence was thoroughly reviewed by Tasmania Police and advice was sought from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).

DPP advised that there is insufficient evidence to lay charges in respect to this matter. Based on the available evidence, Tasmania Police has determined that no further investigation will occur, pending any new information received.


Small Business Grants Program - Conflict of Interest

Ms HADDAD question to MINISTER for HOSPITALITY and SMALL BUSINESS, Ms HOWLETT

[11.01 a.m.]
You have form when it comes to undeclared conflicts of interest. You and the Premier both refuse to come clean about whether you are currently under investigation by the Integrity Commission for having a conflict of interest in relation to grants made during your period as Sports minister. Did you declare any conflict of interest in relation to the recent small business grants program, and if so, what were they?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, what a question? True form from those on the opposite side that would prefer to muckrake than come up with anything serious to say in this place. This is from a party that allowed Rebecca White to clock up over $50,000 in taxpayer funding since announcing she was going to run for the federal seat of Lyons, continuing to be paid as a state MP while she campaigned full time for that seat. We have heard radio silence about this. What an absolute stunt and distraction your comment is?

Let me be clear. The Enabling Small Business Grants is run by the Department of State Growth, with successful applicants chosen by the department in accordance with guidelines and eligibility. We make no apology on this side of the House for backing in our small businesses across this stage. That is what we do on this side of the House.
Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order. The member for Franklin will cease interjecting and is warned again.

Ms HOWLETT - It is not what you do: 42,900 businesses. All you do, that side, is talk Tasmania down.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, I will take a point of order, member for Clark, but interjections will cease.

Ms HOWLETT - Talk Tasmania down. We care about jobs -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, Dr Broad. Mr Willie, you have been warned once, you have been warned again. If the parliament is genuinely serious about this issue - and I do not know why everyone is laughing on both sides.

Ms HOWLETT - The Enabling Small Business Program was non-competitive and run by the Department of State Growth, with successful applicants chosen by the department. The second round of the Enabling Business Grant Program opened on 22 October at 2.00 p.m. Grants of between $2500 and $10,000 were available for capital purchase, with a 30 per cent co-contribution. The program ended the following day when I was sworn in as Small Business minister. It was oversubscribed within three hours.

Supplementary Question

Ms HADDAD - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question from the member.

Ms HADDAD - No one disputes backing in business, but this is about transparency and declaring conflicts of interest. The minister could not confirm whether she declared a conflict of interest, and I draw to her attention that Trent Hasson is a former president of the Young Liberal Party Tasmania and received a substantial amount of taxpayer money through that recent grant program that the minister just outlined. Does the minister have a personal connection to Mr Hasson, and if so, did she declare it prior to awarding him a large sum of money?
Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Because the minister is very keen to answer the supplementary question, I am allowing her to do so. 

Ms HOWLETT - For that side, nothing has changed; it is just grubby, grubby, grubby attacks on a former Department of Premier and Cabinet staffer, a former staffer of the State Service. Like any other business owner -

Members interjecting.

Ms HOWLETT - Are you going to listen or not? 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order. The minister has been asked a question. The minister will answer the question and interjections will cease.

Ms HOWLETT - Mr Hasson was eligible to apply for the funding. I am advised that Mr Hasson was no longer a State Service employee when he applied for or received a grant.

Ms HADDAD - Point of order, honourable Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. It is not about whether he was eligible to apply. It is whether the minister declared a conflict of interest.

The SPEAKER - The point of relevance is to draw back to the question. I will call the minister.

Members interjecting.

Mr Abetz - On the point of order, if I may, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - You may in fact do that.

Mr ABETZ - The answer has been clear that the minister made no determination -

Members interjecting.
The SPEAKER - No argument can be put about the question right now from you, minister. The member has called relevance. The minister, as long as she is relevant, can continue, except she has now run out of time and may resume her seat.


Small Business Grants Program - Conflict of Interest

Ms HADDAD question to MINISTER for HOSPITALITY and SMALL BUSINESS, Ms HOWLETT

[11.06 a.m.]
You personally thanked Mr Hasson in your inaugural speech after being elected to this House. He is clearly one of your closest political supporters and assisted with your campaign. Why did you not declare a conflict interest when he was granted a large sum of public money? It is not about whether he was eligible to apply. It is about whether a conflict of interest was declared.

Can you also confirm that you gave a five-figure taxpayer-funded grant to the former state director of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Gregson? Did you declare a conflict of interest in relation to that grant as well? 

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I certainly was not minister at the time. Grants are done at arm's length. The department is responsible for issuing all grants, not the minister.


Efficiency and Productivity Unit - Proposal

Mrs BESWICK question to TREASURER, Mr BARNETT

[11.07 a.m.]
It has been eight days since you announced the establishment of the Efficiency and Productivity Unit (EPU). The details remain very sketchy. We do not know how big it will be, what its instructions are, how long it will operate for, or how much it will cost taxpayers. It is not too late to admit that it was just a thought bubble. When will you provide any details about the plans for public servants to know what is on the way?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question and appreciate her interest in this matter. It is an important matter because it has been outlined in the Premier's state of the state address. It set out a clear plan to grow our economy, create more jobs, back industry and back business. We have made it clear with that plan, as outlined in the state of the state address, with regard to slashing red tape. I was very pleased to stand with industry and business representatives today to establish the red tape reduction industry taskforce. We will work with them to get the job done.

Yes, as you have indicated in your question, with regard to the hiring freeze that has been announced, we do need a right size for the public service. That was set out in the budget last year. It was set out in the Revised Estimates Report in February. There has been a clear plan all the way through. It is been confirmed in the state of the state address, in terms of the reform of the GBEs, which started last November with the discussion paper feedback in the usual way.

You have made reference to the Efficiency and Productivity Unit. To be clear, this is entirely consistent with the government's plan. It was raised in the state of the state address. I am very pleased and excited to ensure it operates effectively. It will operate within the Department of Premier and Cabinet, but there will be independent people involved in that efficiency and productivity unit. They will report directly to the Premier and myself, consulting carefully with the Secretary of the Department of Premier and Cabinet and the secretary of Treasury. We have engaged with both those secretaries. The Premier and I have talked through that. We will have more to say in due course.

With respect to the Efficiency and Productivity Unit, we have indicated already that that appointment will be made in the not-too-distant future. We will absolutely have more to say about that. It is with respect to our clear plan for the future. The only plan that state Labor has is to hike up charges - to hike up taxes and charges of more than 600 per cent, whether it be Metro, electricity prices, even going to visit Port Arthur. Those charges will be higher under Labor.


Container Deposit Scheme - Price Increases

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.11 a.m.]
I have been contacted by bottle shop operators who are shocked at the price increases that you are imposing through your new container deposit scheme. They have told me that your own bureaucrats told them that the new scheme, which is years delayed, is going to be by far the most expensive in Australia. The price of a 30-can block will be going up by about $6.50 on 1 May this year. They are already calling it 'Rocky's Beer Tax.' 

Can you explain how you have stuffed this up too? How on earth has this scheme been so delayed and is costing so much more than other states and territories? What do you say to the workers of Tasmania when they head to their local bottle shop this weekend to try to stock up?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. What will you say to those people who own a car when their rego goes up over six times under you? What are you going to say?

Members interjecting.

Dr BROAD - Point of order, honourable Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance.

The SPEAKER - It has only been 30 seconds but I will take the point of order from Dr Broad.

Dr BROAD - In this Question Time, the Premier has continued to be irrelevant. He has not answered a single question.

The SPEAKER - Your point of order has to be about this question.

Dr BROAD - Absolutely. He is going nowhere near answering. He is talking about car registration and we are talking about an extra $6.50 on a carton of beer.

The SPEAKER - I will take the point of order on relevance without argument. I will draw the Premier to the question, noting he has only been 30 seconds in.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Speaking of people who continue to be irrelevant, I look no further than the ex-shadow treasurer. He may well benefit from some of the ideas presented in the Chamber about a parliamentary budget office, and the like. If we had a parliamentary budget office back at election time, you may well have got it right and not had to rewrite your three times expenditure -

Members interjecting.

Ms DOW - Point of order -

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order. I will hear the point of order.

Ms DOW - Honourable Speaker, I would use Standing Order 45, but it does not appear to be having much effect. I draw your attention to Standing Order 148, which is about obstructing your directive, Speaker, and not listening to the Speaker, not adhering to the Speaker's orders about relevance, and the like.

The SPEAKER - I will take the point of order. Standing Order 148 is about disorder and suspension. I am hoping not to have to do that today for anyone but the list is about to grow. Premier, I ask you to come to the question so that we can finish Question Time for the second week of the year. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - The Labor Party, I understand, supported the scheme?

Mr Winter - Tried to send it to a committee.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Okay. I remember being on a parliamentary joint House committee in about 2005 on setting up our own container deposit scheme in Tasmania.

Mr Farrell - In 2025, a new tax.

The SPEAKER - Order, Mr Farrell.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Labor and the Greens did nothing. It was up to a Liberal government to introduce the container refund scheme which will be launched on 1 May 2025, I am advised.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I commend minister Jaensch who did a lot of work in this area. I thank Roger for that. What it does is provide a 10 cent refund for eligible containers. It will significantly reduce litter.

Ms Finlay - How does it hike up the cost of products?

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Bass.

Mr Winter - It costs more than twice that.

The SPEAKER - Order, Leader of the Opposition.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - The supplementary is to effectively ask the Premier the same question. Does the Premier endorse 'Rocky's Beer Tax' of $6.50 per 30-can block for every Tasmanian who buys a block after 1 May? 

The SPEAKER - The Premier was, as I wound him up before, getting to the nub of the previous question. I will now ask him to come to the previous question, the supplementary.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the member for his question. Referring to the name 'Rocky',  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.6_D=2.2_C=0.47] the only person who has had a rocky week is you.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=29.1_D=6.6_C=0.54] You have had the rockiest week I can remember from a leader of the opposition in 23 years, in fact.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order.

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=38.1_D=10.6_C=0.57] I remember. I spent 12 years of opposition and I have had some rocky weeks, I can tell you that, but none worse than yours this week. I can say that.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=49.4_D=8.5_C=0.75] The SPEAKER - The House will come to order so that I can hear the Premier address the answer. Premier, you have the call. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=59.6_D=16.0_C=0.63] It provides a 10 cent refund for eligible containers and will significantly reduce litter and increase recycling - a good thing. 

A member - Look to the Greens. Help, Greens. Help him.

Dr Woodruff - If you would like me to endorse your policies, I am happy for the Greens to have a look over all of them. We have a copy of quite a few.

Members interjecting.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=81.4_D=4.9_C=0.51] The SPEAKER - Order, the Premier will resume his seat. The Leader  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=92.4_D=25.4_C=0.75] of the Greens will cease responding to the Premier's commentary. The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting. The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. Premier, resume your seat.

Can I just say, you are becoming far more difficult to manage than you were last year. It is very hard when people listen to the broadcast for anyone to hear, not only the questions or the answers or the odd occasion when an interjection could have stood because it is quite witty.  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=118.5_D=9.2_C=0.86] The overall yelling cannot be tolerated, it really cannot. It sounds dreadful and our reputation in the community, frankly, does not grow with this kind of behaviour.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=129.1_D=11.3_C=0.70] Some interjections are clever or witty. If you just scream them, they do not get heard. With that, the official time for Question Time has concluded. 

Time expired.
ANSWER TO QUESTION

Bridgewater Bridge - Opening Cost

[11.17 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=143.2_D=8.1_C=0.78] Mr ROCKLIFF - Honourable Speaker, I refer to the question from the Leader of the Opposition regarding the Bridgewater bridge opening.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=152.7_D=18.6_C=0.78] Suggestions that this is a $100,000 contract for a party is not only wrong but it belittles a small Tasmanian events business and disrespects the Bridgewater and Granton communities that will be involved in this significant and important commemoration.  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=172.5_D=29.3_C=0.77] The fact is that the Department of State Growth provided a direct-source contract for $24,500 to a Tasmanian event planner on 13 January this year. This is another example of the Leader of the Opposition criticising small business and tourism and investing.

Mr Winter - People are going to come to Tasmania to see a bridge?

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left. The Premier will continue addressing the additional information. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Building a new Bridgewater bridge is the biggest tr [Bookmark: Phr14_O=202.0_D=30.0_C=0.80] ansport infrastructure project in Tasmania's history. It is important to celebrate the achievements and thank the community for their support and patience throughout the project. The additional $70,000 will largely go towards a free community thank-you celebration in Bridgewater to be held immediately prior to opening the bridge, targeted at the communities surrounding the project that have been impacted by our works for the past five years. There has been significant disruption. That is a good opportunity for the community, key project stakeholders and supporters and representatives from all tiers of government to walk on the new bridge before it officially opens and recognise the significance of the project's completion.

Where possible, goods and services will be sourced locally from the communities that we have been working in, and this includes things such as food,  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=258.6_D=11.3_C=0.69] live music, security, face painting, children's games, AV equipment, shuttle buses to take people onto the bridge, marquees, and advertising. Flow-on effects benefiting the local community.

Mr Winter - Did you know you are in a budget crisis?

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left. 

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=270.8_D=2.2_C=0.58] I am sure Mr Farrell will be there. He has not been infected by incessant negativity yet. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Premier, you are just addressing additional information, not inciting a riot in the House.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Hopefully by the opening time you will still be  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=287.1_D=17.8_C=0.83] positive and welcome the opportunity to celebrate with your - and indeed the Lyons - community as well and others. Now, the event will include local community members who have been involved in the project, including school groups, artists and community groups.
The key objectives of the opening celebrations for the new bridge are to celebrate the project and recognise the significance of the completion of Tasmania's largest ever transport infrastructure project. 

I thank Mr Ferguson for his stewardship of the project as well.

Mr Willie - Flogging off assets, you have a hiring freeze, and you are having a $100,000 party.

The SPEAKER - Mr Willie, do you wish to leave the Chamber? That is the order I am about to make.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the local community surrounding the project for their patience during construction. I provide the community with an opportunity to walk across the new bridge prior to opening, and it will be a very good occasion. Bridgewater and Granton communities and the Tasmanian government look forward to community events to celebrate the opening of the largest transport infrastructure project in Tasmanian history. I am suspecting that there will be a few Labor members there as well. We are going, are we?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The Premier can resume his seat. 


PERSONAL EXPLANATION

Minister for Transport

Mr ABETZ - Speaker, I was advised during Question Time that the member for Franklin has never been a minister for transport. I therefore correct the record. Can I say to him, sometimes I wish I could say the same.

The SPEAKER - I do not want to say how far you could have led with your chin right then.


CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Tasmanian Devils AFL Team - Cost to Taxpayers

Mr BAYLEY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.21 a.m.]
My constituents, Angela and Suzanne from Hobart, would like to know, given the AFL is a private business, would hope that the new club and staff salaries of the Tasmanian Devils Football Club are not being paid for by Tasmanian taxpayers? Tasmanians are already looking at paying for a new stadium which is resulting in cuts to health and education. The money should be used on things Tasmanians actually want and need. How much in total has been spent on the AFL agreement to date? Is the taxpayer paying for the staff salaries and other costs of the Devils Football Club? If so, how much?
Agriculture - Update on $10 Billion Sector by 2050

Mr SHELTON question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND WATER, Ms HOWLETT

We know the importance of farming and agriculture to our state, and it is well known we have a target to grow the value of the agricultural sector to $10 billion by 2050. In a recent conversation at the truck run at Longford, in the middle of a very substantial agricultural area, one of the farmers asked me to provide an update on how the state was going in reaching those targets. The question to you is: can you provide an update on how we are going towards meeting the target?


Minister for Housing, Planning and Consumer Affairs - Correspondence with Community 

The SPEAKER - Mr Willie, you are lucky to still be here, but you may have a constituency question.

Mr WILLIE question to MINISTER for HOUSING, PLANNING and CONSUMER AFFAIRS, Mr ELLIS

I have been going for the line. I have not been going over it.

My question is on behalf of my constituent, Christine Hayden, from Glenorchy, and a number of other constituents who have been left unanswered for long periods of time when letters are sent to you on their behalf. Christine has been waiting for return advice on her housing and policing issue for over eight weeks now. Why do you continually ignore the needs of Tasmanians and those asking questions related to your responsibilities? Will you commit to improving your efforts to answer correspondence from members of the community in a timely and helpful manner?


Parkinson's Unit - Staff Reduction

Ms HADDAD question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Ms PETRUSMA

My question is on behalf of my constituent who is the carer for his wife who has Parkinson's disease. He is concerned that in the latest Parkinson's Tasmania Journal it was reported that there would be a reduction in staffing of the Parkinson's unit. He says the nurses there have been and are an essential part of his wife's support, and that, as her carer, he has also benefited from their expertise and care. He wants to know why essential services such as these are being cut and why the government is resorting to accepting funding from a volunteer organisation to maintain their own workforce?


Heritage Grants

Mr WOOD question to MINISTER for THE ARTS and HERITAGE, Ms OGILVIE

My question is from a constituent of mine, Julie. Following a recent article about the Post House in Carlton receiving government funding, she has inquired about further support for Tasmania's heritage sector. In particular, she is interested in potential future grant opportunities and whether she may be eligible to receive funding. Could you please provide information on any upcoming grant programs or initiatives that might assist heritage property owners in preserving and maintaining their historic assets? 


STATEMENT BY SPEAKER

Question Time Conduct

[11.25 a.m.]
The SPEAKER - Honourable members, I raise a couple of things out of the weeks'  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.8_D=0.9_C=0.71] framing of questions.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.2_D=29.0_C=0.83] 

If you have an allegation to make against a member that is a serious allegation, then substantive allegations can be dealt with by a substantive motion. I encourage members to consider that as an opportunity rather than side comments and such that we may have been hearing.

Standing Order 2 also requires members to be not only truthful in their contributions, but to recognise that we have a peculiar right to empower sitting in this room to say pretty much anything we want.  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=60.4_D=25.0_C=0.90] That obviously does not apply to me, sadly. Do be careful when you exercise that right, because it is a significant thing to name anyone in this Chamber, whether they are an existing or a former member or a member of the community or of the broader world. I want members to be conscious of that obligation and to be very careful about using the powers that we all have in here.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=86.2_D=7.2_C=0.82] I remind members that Standing Order 352 does allow people to come in to make representations to this Chamber if they have been misrepresented.  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=93.8_D=15.6_C=0.80] That is an important thing to remember because we like not to have to use that. It is not quite as powerful as the one in the other place, but it exists here. 

Standing Order 148 that was raised today does talk about persistent and wilful obstruction and persistently and wilfully disregarding the authority of the Chair.  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=110.2_D=16.4_C=0.90] Eventually, people are listening, but I want people to be aware of that Standing Order for the future because we are a larger Chamber now and that means that it gets out of control quite quickly. 

I wanted to draw those points of orders to people's attention. Please feel free to read the Standing Orders during the break. There might be a test. Who knows? 


PETITIONS

Safe Bike and Walking Track Connecting Swanwick and Coles Bay

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=137.3_D=14.8_C=0.83] Ms BADGER - Honourable Speaker, I have the honour to be the bearer of two petitions which are similarly worded, a written petition signed by approximately 275 petitioners and an e-petition signed by approximately 139 petitioners praying that the House's attention is drawn to the need for a safe biking and walking track to connect Swanwick and Coles Bay. The petition conforms with the relevant Standing Orders and Rules of the House. 

I move - 

That the petitions be received.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=240.7_D=2.8_C=0.51] Petitions received.


MESSAGE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL

Committee Membership

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=273.9_D=12.5_C=0.76] Honourable Speaker,

The Legislative Council has discharged the honourable member for Elwick, Ms Thomas, from the Joint Select Committee on Energy Matters and has appointed the honourable member for Rumney, Ms Lovell, to the resulting vacancy.

C. Farrell,
President, 
Legislative Council, 
13 March 2025.


MOTION

Suspension of Standing Orders

[11.30 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House)(by leave) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That so much of Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent -

 The question before the House at 1.00 p.m. this day from standing adjourned until a later hour; and

The honourable member for Lyons, Mr Farrell, from making a statement to the House 2.30 p.m. this day for a period not exceeding 30 minutes.

Motion agreed to.
SITTING DATES

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House at its rising does adjourn until 1 April next at 10.00 a.m.

Motion agreed to.


MOTION

Leave to Move Motion Without Notice

[11.31 a.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I seek leave to move a motion without notice for the purpose of moving the suspension of Standing Orders to enable Notice of Motion 96 to be debated forthwith.

The SPEAKER - I might put the seeking of leave motion first, unless anyone wishes to speak to it? 

The question is - 

That leave be granted.

With the House proceeding to divide:
Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - For people's information, historically we use the seeking of leave and move straight to the substantive motion. Nobody spoke to the seeking of leave.

Dr Woodruff - I thought the member was just about to speak.

The SPEAKER - I sought advice from the member while she was standing and she seemed comfortable. If you wish to recommit a vote at the end of this, then that is a matter that you can seek advice from the Clerks on.

Dr Woodruff - We might not get past the start.

The SPEAKER - It is a seeking of leave, not a substantive motion. We have been caught in this before, where we had a 35-minute debate on seeking leave and then a 35-minute debate on the motion. Historically, what seems to happen is that we move through seeking leave quickly to the second one. We have commenced the process. We can seek to recommit, but we need to do this first. I can check with the Clerk.

Mr Abetz - Speaker, can we stop the process by leave and the concurrence of the House? Possibly that is a course of action to be taken.

The SPEAKER - Clerk, can I confirm, do we need to follow the vote through? What needs to happen now?
Dr Woodruff - We need to know what we are seeking leave about.

The SPEAKER - Well, yes you do, but if the House does not have that debate, there is not much I can do. If nobody speaks to it, then I have to put it to the vote.

Dr Woodruff - I thought Ms Johnston -

The SPEAKER - Arguing with me at the moment, Dr Woodruff, is not going to make it any easier -

Dr Woodruff - I am not. I am just seeking understanding.

The SPEAKER - What we have to do is finish this, because we have called a division. At the end of that the House has the capacity to ask to recommit the matter.

While the bells are ringing, the only way to progress this now is if the seeking of leave is granted. The House can then have a debate on the motion to suspend, which could then have a vote. That would be a matter for the House to determine. 

With no-one jumping on the seeking of leave, putting the motion is what we do. We did that. We have to have this vote now. However, if this passes - and I understand from the interjection from the Leader of the House that there is a willingness not to inadvertently deny the member the right to speak - then we can move to the actual putting of the motion, which is another 35 minute debate. It will depend on how you all vote once we turn the bells off. 

Whilst I could ask people to report full attendance, we might just let the bells ring a little longer so that you can have that conversation about where you want to end up after this. I cannot make the call from here.

If this one passes, the next debate is a 35 minute debate on the suspension, which would probably mean that the process progresses to the point of then determining whether the suspension occurs. It is a matter for the House. 

Has everybody had enough conversation that I can ask the Whips to report full attendance? 

Ms Brown - Yes.

The SPEAKER - Ms Brown is happy to report full attendance. Mr Bayley?

Mr Bayley - Yes.

The SPEAKER - With that, we will stop the bells and lock the doors. The question is -

That leave be granted to debate a suspension of the Standing Orders.

SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS

Debate Motion Forthwith

[11.40 a.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That so much of Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent Notice of Motion No. 96 from being debated forthwith.

This is an incredibly urgent motion regarding the state's finances. The urgency relates to this, and the reason why Standing Orders must be suspended today to debate this particular motion, is that we only have four sitting weeks remaining until the state budget is handed down. We know that the budget is in a diabolical position. It has been outlined by the Premier, the Treasurer, and  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.1_D=4.7_C=0.75] by many economists. We are in a very difficult position.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.9_D=29.4_C=0.82] There is no plan that we can see in relation to fixing the budget. Eminent economist, Saul Eslake, has made it very clear that the measures outlined by the Treasurer and the Premier are either going to make no difference or, in more likelihood, actually make things significantly worse. We have no time to waste. The Tasmanian public are relying on us to do the right thing now and prevent further disaster.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=60.9_D=29.2_C=0.77] The motion that I am seeking suspension to debate will put in place some strict guardrails against unwise government spending. It puts in place much greater transparency and accountability measures around the budget. These are critical. It is a very difficult time for state finances. The impact that it has on Tasmanians requires that we put these guardrails in. Together the measures will help to give the parliament  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=91.0_D=7.1_C=0.72] and the Tasmanian public more confidence that this government will do the job they expect it to do and need it to do:  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=98.4_D=29.3_C=0.76] to be responsible with the state's finances and ensure Tasmanians, now and into the future, know that their government will be in position to deliver all the services, facilities and other essential functions of government that Tasmanians rely upon.

The motion that I am seeking leave for suspension to debate relates to those guardrails. It was called upon by Mr Eslake himself. I want to quote Mr Eslake  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=128.3_D=29.6_C=0.76] in a response that he provided to the government's response to his report. He says:

While I am genuinely surprised and especially disappointed at the government's rejection of what I thought were (and still think are) fairly innocuous recommendations such as far more comprehensive information on and analysis of the performance of and outlook for the Tasmanian economy and of the recommendations in my review for strengthening the governance around the setting of fiscal strategy targets and the timing, preparation and content of budget documents and other financial reports.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=158.1_D=13.0_C=0.77] Mr Eslake notes some of the discussion of these topics regarding the response from the government to his report reads like it was written by Sir Humphrey Appleby, the head of the civil service in the series Yes, Prime Minister. He then goes on to say:

I note that the government's response makes absolutely no reference to my recommendation for the establishment of a Tasmanian parliamentary budget office. I hope that the opposition, minor parties and independents will pursue these reforms on the floor of the parliament, with a view to forcing their adoption as they did with the review of Tasmania's education system.

Mr Eslake could not be clearer. It is a plea to this parliament to do the work that the government is unwilling to do. This matters to Tasmanians. It is about accountability,  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=200.7_D=30.0_C=0.71] transparency and integrity. Mr Eslake then goes on to warn:

As the state Treasury has repeatedly warned over past nine years, the longer such decisions are postponed, the more difficult - both for the government of the day and for the people of Tasmania - they are likely to be.

We need to stop this disaster now, not wait until the 29 May. We need to put in place some guardrails now, so that what happens on 29 May will be that there will be far greater scrutiny from this parliament on the government's budget response,  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=230.8_D=26.1_C=0.77] and far greater scrutiny and provision of information to the Tasmanian people. It will be transparent, accountable, and have key hallmarks of integrity. I urge colleagues to support this, to do the work that Mr Eslake has been calling us to do, for the opposition and the crossbench to back this motion and to back the suspension of Standing Orders.
I will note in particular that this has been a key topic of Question Time for the last two weeks.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=257.5_D=5.8_C=0.78] Of the 62 Labor opposition questions to the government, 39 have been about the budget crisis [Bookmark: Phr13_O=263.8_D=30.0_C=0.72] . Rightly so. They should absolutely be holding the government to account during Question Time.

The suspension of Standing Orders means we can do more than just questioning them during Question Time. We can put in place these important guardrails. It is absolutely critical. We heard this morning the Treasurer's refusal to say whether asset sales will be included in the 2025-26 budget, or what the plan B is. We need to do the government's work for them. We need to put the parameters around that and put the guardrails up. I urge members to support the suspension of Standing Orders.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=294.1_D=4.6_C=0.58] Time expired.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=302.9_D=2.0_C=0.71] [11.45 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, this matter clearly is not urgent. The member has private member's time coming up, well ahead of the budget. The motion was tabled on Tuesday, but no attempts were made to have it brought on. There were no attempts to have it brought on yesterday either. Has something changed between yesterday and today? Not that I can see. We have business of the House to continue with, not least of which is a maiden speech from the newly minted member for Lyons.

Has a sufficient argument been made to disrupt that? With respect, no. The government will also seek to progress the Electoral Amendment (Alternative Voting Procedures) Bill 2025, amendments that seek to address concerns raised by Disability Advocacy groups about the challenges experienced by voters with vision impairment or print disability, and also the lack of choice faced by voters with such an impairment in regional and remote areas. The sooner this legislation can be progressed to the upper House the better, not forgetting that we have Legislative Council elections in a matter of months.

I turn to paragraph (4) of the proposed motion, which is allegedly urgent, which talks about election commitments of public money, that they are efficient, effective, economical and ethical. Let me say that the people decide that at the ballot box. I am surprised that the independent member for Clark would raise that with her close association with the federal independent member for Clark who, after an election, without having said anything during the election, negotiated certain financial advantages for his electorate as part and parcel of helping a government to be formed.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Interjections will cease. I draw the minister to the fact that this is a debate about a suspension of Standing Orders.

Mr ABETZ - Yes, absolutely. It has been asserted that paragraph (4) of this motion is somehow urgent. What I say to the House is that in our democracy it is not for unelected people to make a decision whether an election policy is efficient or otherwise.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, Leader of the Greens. Mr Willie, do you wish to leave?
Mr ABETZ - It is for the people of Tasmania through the ballot box to make those determinations, so there is no urgency whatsoever in relation to paragraph (4).

In relation to the other matters, the point made by the member for Clark in seeking urgency in fact undermined the argument for urgency, though she indicated how many questions had in fact been asked of the government and how many matters had been pursued during Question Time over the last fortnight in relation to this matter, and now all of a sudden on the very last day of the first fortnight of sitting, this is allegedly urgent. The case for urgency has not been made out and with respect, it seems to me that there is an attempt by an independent to get a second bite of the cherry and a bit more time of parliamentary time than should normally otherwise be allocated. The case for urgency has clearly not been made out.

[11.48 a.m.]
Dr BROAD (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, while Labor largely supports the intent of Motion 96 that stands on the Notice Paper, and we do absolutely agree that the budget is in a terrible state, we think that this is actually a process issue. Clearly, this debate belongs in private member's time, and we do not believe that there has been an argument for urgency. What we have seen is three members stand on the lawns of parliament yesterday - Mr Garland, Mr Jenner and Ms Johnston, discussing this as a as a matter of urgency. Yet, Mr Garland and Mr Jenner had an opportunity yesterday in private member's time to bring this debate forward. Then, Ms Johnston has an opportunity in April, which is not very far away.

If you have a look at the motion itself, we can see from paragraph (1), that it orders the Treasurer to make a statement to the House within 30 days of the release of the Budget papers, which will in effect be the end of June. The second point calls on the Treasurer to fund within the 2025-26 Budget, the establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Office, but that calls on the Treasurer to consider it, not actually ordering: 

As a matter of urgency, calls on the treasurer to table in the House a bill to amend the charter of budget responsibility.

I would point out that a bill of that description would take some time to prepare and should be done with consultation. That is not something that is going to be turned around before the Budget is delivered. Finally:

(4)	Further calls on the government to implement by the end of 2025 the recommendations from the Integrity Commission Paper No 2.

Again, that is the end of the year. I do not think the urgency is the argument for why this is urgent has been made. This is a process issue and I note that Ms Johnston has been a stickler for process in past debates. I will also point out that this sort of raises greater issues as well.

We saw three Independents standing on the lawn yesterday, and what we have had in this place is the Independents at the beginning of this parliament claiming to deliver stability. They are not delivering stability by the comments that they made on the lawns of parliament in relation to this motion. They provided commentary that if this motion was not passed, they are threatening to block the budget and, in effect, bring down the government. 

Ms Johnston signed a deal to support the government in return for extra staff and, it appears, a car park, and has now dropped it. The last Lambie standing, Mr Jenner, had brokered a deal but that has now been thrown out. I point out that at least Mr Garland has been consistent. 

We believe strongly that parliament needs to function and that we do have a duty to hold the government to account, absolutely, but the other point that we have made quite clearly, and the Leader of the Labor Party, Mr Winter, did make the point, that we will be responsible and we will not be reckless. Threats to block the budget by the independents who are supposedly propping up what is a disastrous government is indeed reckless and we have been consistent in saying that Tasmanians do not want a fourth election in seven or so years.

The comments to block the Budget are, in effect, threatening to bring down the government, which is not, particularly at this point, in the best interest of the state. It may precipitate an election and deliver a similar result. Blocking the budget is actually a serious undertaking and should not be done in a reckless manner and we should not have independents threatening to throw the toys out of the cot if they do not get a motion passed within this place.

I will go back to the original argument. We believe this is a process issue that should be done in private member's time. If Ms Johnston chooses to bring this motion forward in her private member's time, which is coming up in the next session, then we would like to have that debate and do it in a proper manner.

[11.53 a.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for Clark, my colleague, for bringing this urgency motion on. We strongly support the suspension of Standing Orders and do believe this is an urgent matter. It is also a matter of principle in my mind, with regard to debating the issues that are in this motion. We have spent an inordinate amount of time over recent times debating the budget. It is clear the budget is in crisis and this motion sets up some elements of checks and balances around the budget going forward. What is not to like about that? I do not understand the Labor Party's position regarding not wanting to have this conversation now and not wanting to actually get some of these things in place. In relation to the leader of government business, if you do not like the fourth point in this motion, Mr Abetz, you can seek to amend it and support the rest of it. 

It is urgent. Treasury is currently working on the Budget and it is due in a few short months. Budget submissions have been received by Treasury and we know from the supplementary budget that we debated this week that the government departments, not all budget submissions are being met, that there are decisions being made whereby agencies are not actually getting what they ask and we have had to have the Treasurer come back to us with his hand out asking for this to be done. 

It is not fair to expect Ms Johnston to wait a full month before having the opportunity to debate this motion. It is urgent. It sets up some important parameters and important checks and balances and it should be debated now. We should resolve this here and now. The Budget is in a terrible situation and the government continues to spend money hand over fist, including on the stadium. We are spending inordinate amounts of money already on the stadium. We have had eminent experts like Nicholas Gruen articulate that the Premier's commitment that this can be built for $750 million is just utter BS. This is a billion dollar stadium plus it is bearing all the hallmarks of mismanagement and it has all the hallmarks of being refused by the Planning Commission as well, and there are critical enabling bits of infrastructure - this is a really important point - that go to the safety of patrons and the movement of traffic and so forth that are simply not funded by the government, not part of the application. It is critically important that we get some checks and balances in place so that the Treasurer knows that he is going to be held to account and it is going to be closely watched.

We also know that services are being cut. We are in a health, education and housing crisis and there are critical cuts to services. Ms Badger asked questions this morning about job losses in TAFE. This is happening right now and we need to be doing something about it. The efficiency dividends likewise have been put on the table by the government and have been overwhelmingly condemned by people like Mr Eslake, who says that they are an inefficient and lazy way of managing spend. This is an urgent issue. We do need to get this into place as soon as possible.

The motion sets up a framework by which the Treasurer is to be held to account, making him make a statement within 30 days of the release of the Budget or revised Budget Estimate. 

The establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Office is a recommendation. It is an institution in other jurisdictions. It is a clear recommendation of Mr Eslake. He is extremely frustrated that the government has rejected it outright. It would increase transparency for us in this place of the budget and what is going forward and it is simply nonsensical for the government to be ruling it out so unequivocally.

Bringing forward a bill to amend the charter of budget responsibilities - yes, that will take some time to develop but let us get it going. Let us get a commitment from the government to actually do this work and get it going so that we can have it in place as soon as possible.

When it comes to the grant commitments in election campaigns, like I say, if the leader of government business does not like that bit, he is welcome to try to remove it from this, but I remind the leader of government business that this is an activity that the Integrity Commission has described as indirect electoral bribery. This is a stain on our democracy and it is something that desperately needs to be dealt with.

There have been a lot of questions asked in this House this week, yes, but there have not been a lot of answers given. It is urgent. We need to debate this and we need to debate it now. 

Time expired.

[11.58 a.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I too support the member for Clark for bringing this forward. There are only four sitting weeks before the Budget is handed down and we know that the final touches have been put on the Budget and that last minute changes are strongly resisted and undesirable. This is the last opportunity for the parliament to force the government to take serious steps in this Budget and with its fiscal policy before the Budget is handed down. This is a matter of significant public importance and urgency.

In terms of the work this parliament has to do today, it is highly likely that the Electoral Amendment Bill and the Justice Miscellaneous Bill will pass without debate, and the Tasmanian Community Fund Amendment Bill could hardly be considered urgent.

There has been a lot of talk from Labor about the dire position of the Budget and how the government has failed to act on the Eslake report. Here is their chance to actually do something about it. Support this motion to suspend Standing Orders and let us get on debating the direst crisis facing this state.

[11.59 a.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, as a member of the crossbench, I am always in favour of independence and others getting more time in this place to raise issues. When we formed an agreement with the government to provide stability to this parliament, a key part of the negotiations were about the Standing Orders and how we dealt with matters and how members of the crossbench were able to raise their issues. There were extra questions, extra time and allocation applied.

The question in relation to this matter is: what is the difference between important and urgent? I do believe we should respect the forms of the House. There are ways in which we can deal with these kinds of matters in a way which can ensure that these kinds of motions are debated. That day was yesterday. This was a motion that was put on the table on Tuesday, I understand, and yesterday there was flexibility between the crossbench to have a discussion about how you share time. If  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=16.8_D=26.4_C=0.74] there is a majority of the members on the crossbench in a private member's day that feel strongly about an issue there is a capacity to bring these things on. Whilst I believe this is an important issue and I respect the motivations behind the member moving this motion to seek to create a precedent around a motion such as this on a government members day will then, I think, lead to a walking away of the agreements that we made when we put together Standing Orders of this House. 

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=44.5_D=0.6_C=0.72] There are important issues outlined and raised in this motion. I think there are important issues that should be debated as well: the collapse of maternity services at the Hobart Private, the collapse of Metro, in terms of the services to the community. There are job losses at EZ, at Nyrstar, and concerns about that. There are a range of important matters  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=76.7_D=27.8_C=0.81] that this House needs to debate and to discuss. We have Question Time, private member's time. We have Adjournment debates. We do have motions to suspend Standing Orders. They are usually about matters of confidence in either the premier, a minister of government. There are censure motions, and there are a whole range of other things which are absolutely urgent before the chair and before the House that need to be debated and resolved before the work of the parliament can continue.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=105.3_D=6.6_C=0.65] A matter of the budget, regardless of the concern and the timing of it, is an important issue, but in terms of the forms of the House we do need to be respectful. We do need to understand that each of us - all 35 of us and the parties and the crossbench - must be respectful of the forms of the House. 

I will not say it is a whim. I am not saying you are doing this on a whim. Try to insert the agreements that we put in place to debate a certain matter when there were opportunities to debate this yesterday, when there are opportunities, if they were [Bookmark: Phr8_O=142.4_D=29.9_C=0.79]  as urgent to be brought on, the three members and good valuable members of the crossbench who feel strongly about this issue, who raised it and was in the media today, obviously, there was a capacity to bring this matter on yesterday to work through these matters. 

I support the intent behind the motion. We should debate this kind of motion, but we do need to respect the forms of the House. We do need to understand there is a difference between important and urgent and ultimately the will of the House will determine whether it is important or urgent.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=172.6_D=4.9_C=0.75]  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=179.4_D=4.2_C=0.49]  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=187.5_D=24.9_C=0.66] [12.03 p.m.]
Mr JENNER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, obviously I support the motion and I thought most members would. I also have listened to what has been said by Dr Broad on different areas. You talk about stability and I totally agree, but there comes a time when you have to trade off stability for accountability and that is what we felt has not been happening and that is why we got together.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=213.8_D=9.3_C=0.47] That was not any sort of thing to bring the government down, but we just wanted to get these things in place. We do not think they are huge asks, but we do believe  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=223.3_D=17.7_C=0.61] that they would help with accountability with the intention of being transparent.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Can I have no interjections please?

Mr JENNER - Sorry?

The SPEAKER - I am hearing you, Mr Jenner. I was distracted by interjections. You keep going. 

Mr JENNER - Okay, thank you. I was not listening to the interjections.  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=244.9_D=9.2_C=0.62] With the worsening debt and deficit crisis of the state and spending truly out of control, it does need to be scrutinised and addressed and that is what we thought this would bring.  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=255.0_D=20.4_C=0.67] I guess it is for those future generations so they are not left with that millstone of debt hanging around their necks and, yes, many questions have been asked of the Budget, but, as Labor know, they are not usually answered and so, consequently, I do support the motion for those reasons. 

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=277.4_D=21.4_C=0.64] The SPEAKER (Ms O'Byrne) - The question is -

That the motion to suspend Standing Orders be agreed to.

STATEMENT BY SPEAKER

Process of Suspension of Standing Orders

The SPEAKER - Honourable members, to explain how the process works for the future, people do not have to speak to the seeking of leave, but there is an opportunity for a 35-minute debate at the seeking of leave. Once it is put, we have to go through it. Once we are in, once the bells have been rung, we are committed then to that process.

If the matter was won, we could move to the suspension for a 35-minute debate. Had it been lost, then the motion would have ended at that point.

The House has opportunities to bring matters before the House again, but we would not have been able to recommit that vote because it was not a confusion about voting because the bells have been rung. I will be a little conscious of providing a little bit more time, but it is not uncommon for us not to have a debate on the seeking of leave for most motions, as we did not for the motions that were raised by the leader of the government that time. 

I remind members that all warnings still stand. It is a short day, so let us try to keep everyone in the House. 


MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Budget Efficiencies

[12.11 p.m.]
Mrs BESWICK (Braddon) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the House takes note of the following matter: budget efficiencies.

I rise today to speak on the topic of budget efficiencies. The Treasurer's recent acknowledgement that Tasmania's budget is in urgent need of repair has sparked a passionate debate. While privatisation has dominated, it has somewhat overshadowed the broader challenge of bringing spending back under control. First, let us acknowledge that curbing spending without affecting service delivery is a lot easier said than done.
Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Can I have silence in the room, please, so the member can be heard?

Mrs BESWICK - The Liberal government has learned that the hard way over the 11 years on that side of the House. The Liberals came to power in 2014, promising to downsize Tasmania's public service by 500 positions. By September that year, the government announced an additional 500 jobs would have to go after a pay freeze proposal was delayed, but any shrinking of the public service was short-lived as the workforce grew by 30 per cent between 2015 and 2023. The growth has continued since then to about 36,000 full-time, part-time and casual staff. 

Instead of downward pressure on the public service that was promised in 2014, the current government, albeit under different premiers and cabinets, has overseen sustained growth. I am not saying that is a bad thing. We know demand has grown in the Health department, and in improving educational outcomes, so the government has had no choice but to employ additional workers. COVID threw up challenges we could never have predicted, so we needed to create new roles. I bring up the gradual expansion of the public service to make a point that this challenge should not come as a shock to the state government.

Saul Eslake told The Advocate yesterday:

Tasmania's public finances are in the mess they are in because, since 2017-18, this government has consciously chosen to increase spending without giving a moment's consideration as to how that spending should or would be paid for. 

I am surprised by some of the recent announcements aimed at finally bringing spending under control.

Instead of asking department heads to find sensible savings that will not impact service delivery, the Treasurer has announced the Efficiency and Productivity Unit (EPU), an additional office with an unknown price tag tasked to find efficiencies that apparently no one else can. If it walks like a stunt and it quacks like a stunt. The EPU was announced with little detail attached. It is not clear how big it will be, where its members will come from, and what its instructions will be. We do not know how long it will operate or how much it will cost. This week, the Treasurer announced another prong in his newfound attack on government waste: a red-tape auditor.

If the goal is reducing waste, I wonder why there is a need for a red-tape auditor on top of a Red-Tape Reduction Coordinator. The Premier earlier this week explained that the Red-Tape Reduction Coordinator produces an audit report and then, this morning, we had an announcement of a red-tape task force. The potential for an episode of political satire is staring us in the face. Perhaps the EPU will identify that we have too many people trying to cut red tape.

I am a huge advocate for reducing waste of all kinds, and especially wasted time and effort. Work smarter, not harder. As I have previously advocated, the best way to support streamlining tasks, developing efficiencies and creating continuous improvement cultures is to send people to the lean and slick SIMBA simulated work environment - incredibly fun and inspiring world-class experience in Burnie.

The government's intention to remove needless red tape is laudable, but the focus coming 11 years into government naturally invites scepticism. If there is a freeze on filling non-essential roles, I would question the need for two positions tasked with auditing and reducing red tape. Surely it makes more sense to have audited and then coordinated the removal.

The task of reducing spending without hurting the services we rely on is a tough one. For me there are some obvious places to start. We regularly hear about the cost of temporary staff like locums and the impact of overtime on the health budget. Recruiting skilled permanent staff is a challenge, but we need to give ourselves the best chance for competing with other states.

How about we look at the disconnect between long-service leave provisions in other states and our own? Why do we not get our digital health system up and running? Let us look at our central department supports and find ways for them to take the strain off frontline workers, like simplifying records management systems in order to allow the nurses, psychologists, teachers, principals, and all the rest be freed up to do their jobs.

We obviously need ambassadors for efficiency finding and improving implementation. Every business does. I do not know why we cannot offer to build a little EPU inside each department, send them to the SUI, give them the opportunity to get together and swap ideas, and empower them to work with the department secretaries and secretary heads so that those at the frontline can say, 'We told them what we needed', and they made the changes to make our lives better.

[12.16 a.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Treasurer) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for bringing this forward for debate in the parliament. Budget efficiency is a very important topic. I really appreciate her positive contribution in terms of options on the way forward. I want to acknowledge that and say thank you for that.

I think the intent behind the objective of the member is certainly supportive. We need to be more efficient and productive. I have made that very clear in my role as Treasurer. The Premier has made it very clear in his plan for Tasmania, outlined in the state of the state address last week, which was very well-received. In fact, the business communities described it as the most ambitious plan that they have seen in decades. I want to put that on the record. I thank the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI) for that. The business community are backing it. They have called on state Labor to work with us on the plan and the implementation of that plan, outlined by the Premier.

Efficiency and productivity is a key part of that plan going forward. There is no surprise to me, nor I think to many in this Chamber, and certainly in the business community, that Tasmania has shot to the top of business confidence in all states of Australia. That is absolutely noted. It should be acknowledged that business community confidence is up. It is up, up, up. We appreciate that.

There is more work to do. We will continue to work shoulder to shoulder with the business and industry groups. That is why I stood there this morning with business and industry stakeholders announcing the red tape reduction industry taskforce. I will be meeting with them in coming weeks, and we will be getting their feedback on how we can do even better.

Yesterday, I announced the audit of all licences, permits and approvals relevant to state government and local government. We look forward to working with the Local Government Association in that regard as well. The feedback is very strong.

In the National Australia Bank (NAB) survey, Tasmania came second in terms of business conditions. There is an indicator there that we have got the policy parameters right and the plan is working. There is more work to do. We need to implement our plan for budget efficiencies and productivity.

There is no surprise that our economy hit a record $40.6 billion at the recent gross state product figures. Just last week state final demand hit $48.9 billion. That is very encouraging. That is on the back of retail trade being at record levels. That is a sign and an indication of positivity in the community, that the community are feeling that they want to spend. That is also on the back of a historically low unemployment. We are well in excess of 40,000 jobs since we came to government in 2014. We are pleased about that. The wage growth is higher than the national average as well. We are sticking to the plan and there is more work to do.

The Efficiency and Productivity Unit will report directly to the Premier and myself. We will be working with our secretaries and working cross-government. I acknowledge the member's other suggestions in how we can get more efficiencies and productivity across government. You made reference to working within each department. The role of the Efficiency and Productivity Unit is to look at those government programs and services where we can do better. Is it relevant? Is it up to date? Is it meeting? Is it fit for purpose?  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.6_D=28.2_C=0.84] Does it meet those objectives? I appreciate that.
I likewise look forward to getting any other feedback from the member, engaging with the member, members of the crossbench and others on how we can do it better. I look forward to doing that, particularly as we develop plans for the budget to be released on 29 May 2025.

One area of concern I do have relates to Labor's plan to tax Tasmanians by stealth.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=59.1_D=24.6_C=0.80] With the public response to the state of the state address by the Leader for the Opposition, where he wants government business enterprises to be 'more profitable', the only way to get to a surplus is under modelling that I have released today. It is indicated very clearly that Labor believes jacking up charges  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=84.2_D=3.8_C=0.75] for government businesses is their solution to the surplus. They would increase those charges some six times for bus fares, electricity prices, even for going to Port Arthur to visit.

[12.22 a.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) -  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=104.8_D=8.6_C=0.85] Honourable Speaker, I rise to speak on this matter. I thank the member for bringing it forward. It is a very important matter [Bookmark: Phr7_O=115.2_D=1.3_C=0.84] . I value her contribution.  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=118.5_D=29.4_C=0.78] The Treasurer just talked about a plan that never actually went to an election. They know that privatisation stinks. That is exactly why they said nothing about it last year during the election. Last week we had the Premier basically tell the parliament that the state is broke and there is now a fire sale. Everything is for sale apart from Hydro, because they have broken the budget. That is why they are doing this. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=148.8_D=23.6_C=0.79]  He has not come to parliament with some formed-up proposals and tried to sell the benefits of them.

I have noted though that there is a senior member on that side who is trying to do that, in direct conflict with the Premier's message about the state of the budget. We have Mr Abetz often standing to try and sell the benefits of service delivery.  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=172.4_D=5.0_C=0.54] I think that he is probably questioning the messaging that is happening over there on that side of the House [Bookmark: Phr11_O=179.6_D=3.4_C=0.80] . He is trying to turn it around. I have taken note of that.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=183.8_D=2.0_C=0.71] It was a plan that never went to an election.  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=187.6_D=25.1_C=0.83] They know that Tasmanians do not like it. It is all because they cannot manage money. There is no better example of that than the questioning that we had today around a $100,000 tender for a party to celebrate the Bridgewater bridge - which is over $200 million overdue and years late [Bookmark: Phr14_O=213.4_D=13.7_C=0.83] . They are going to spend $100,000 blowing their own trumpets about a project that is delayed and way over budget. At the same time, they are implementing a hiring freeze in the public service.  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=229.2_D=14.9_C=0.76] This is a lazy plan which they are handing to unelected bureaucrats because they have caused the problem, not the unelected bureaucrats. They cannot tell us how much that particular measure is going to save. They cannot tell us what an essential worker is. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=244.5_D=29.1_C=0.81] 

They are going on this budget cut agenda at the same time they are wasting money on $100,000 parties to celebrate themselves. It is what we have come to expect from this government. Waste has been a hallmark of this government. They spent $7.2 million to not build a prison in northern Tasmania. They put a whole lot of communities through a whole lot of trauma.  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=274.6_D=16.9_C=0.78] The member for Lyons is sitting there. I am sure some of the communities that he represents were very unhappy with the government's approach during that time. They wasted $7.2 million in the process.

We know that there are many jokes being had around Hobart at the moment.  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=293.2_D=11.0_C=0.59] I hear it often in the community. There are these gantries that have been placed around greater Hobart that cost $22 million. They cost around $1.5 million each. They tell you how long you are going to be blocked in the traffic. It is an old technology. A lot of cars link to phones now. You can put in Google Maps and you get the time on your display in your car. If you do not have that, it is not that hard to buy a cradle for $20 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.1_D=6.3_C=0.72]  that will give you the same sorts of information. We have a government that spent $22 million on these things [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.9_D=11.5_C=0.86] . People in the community think it is ridiculous. It is another hallmark of this government where they are wasting money at the same time as they are going on this misguided privatisation agenda and cutting the budget.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=44.8_D=23.7_C=0.87] Self-promotion is another area that I have spoken about in this House this week, advertising. They are spending millions of dollars advertising and on things that they should know better about - things like the biggest stuff-up in Tasmania's infrastructure history, the Spirits. They are taking out full page ads in the newspapers  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=69.4_D=9.4_C=0.76] with falsehoods on the credit card of the Tasmanian tax payer. Consultants blow the budget by $40 million every year.  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=81.0_D=27.2_C=0.78] Travel is always up under this government. We have seen megabucks being poured into Marinus with no result. We had an energy crisis some time ago now, but there was $180 million on that. We have had hydrogen buses for $11 million sitting in a shed because there is nothing to drive them with. This is a government that is wasting money in a frivolous way. It cannot manage money. It has to stop.

[12.27 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=111.9_D=26.7_C=0.80] Mr BAYLEY (Clark) -Honourable Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to talk about budget efficiencies. I thank the member for Braddon for bringing this on. The topic of budget efficiency immediately brings to mind budget efficiency dividends. More broadly, efficiency, when it comes to budgeting, is clearly much wider. It is about managing spending, it is about infrastructure spend, it is about  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=139.5_D=6.4_C=0.69] targeted savings, and it is about efficient revenue raising.

We had the Eslake Report released in August last year, which made some clear recommendations about this kind of thing, but also clearly laid the blame as to where we are, and why we are in this budget crisis. To quote from Mr Eslake, he talks about the Tasmanian public sector finances deteriorating significantly since the latter part of 2010 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=172.2_D=8.8_C=0.73] , despite a noticeable improvement in Tasmania's economic fortunes. He goes on to say that these trends, like a deteriorating budget, were partly attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, and more recently to the need to provide for compensation payments to survivors of child sexual abuse in state institutions, but he says:

… they began before the onset of the pandemic, and have continued after it.

He is abundantly clear that it is the policy decisions of government that have got us into this crisis. He has given some really clear recommendations about revenue raising. Some of these we support, like  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=211.5_D=29.9_C=0.73] in making sure that industries like mining actually pay their fair share and pay royalties that are on par with the rest of the country. These are policies that we took to the last election and they are eminently sensible at the national level. We are wanting to see our billionaires and major corporations pay their fair share.

He has also made a clear recommendation around the infrastructure spend and how infrastructure spend should be managed. It should not be managed by picking and choosing all of the projects that  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=241.5_D=17.8_C=0.73] you want to build over the coming year in a budget and then just adding them up and sucking up the figure. He basically says you need to set a figure and then work out a priority of the infrastructure spends within that.

When it comes to infrastructure spend, the stadium is the one that stands  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=261.2_D=12.0_C=0.69] for Tasmanians as such an unnecessary, unwanted and inappropriate spend when we are in a health crisis and a housing crisis, when we have some of the worst education results in the country [Bookmark: Phr16_O=273.7_D=29.5_C=0.78] . Seeing Tasmania spending hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars on a stadium - it is going to be over a billion dollars according to Nicholas Gruen - people are just scratching their heads and asking what the logic is.

It gets worse than that when it comes to the Macquarie Point site. The member who just resumed his seat, the shadow treasurer, talked about government paying out $7 million to not build a prison. They did exactly the same thing at  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=303.7_D=1.2_C=0.56] Macquarie Point. They paid $3 million to a Melbourne developer to not build the houses from their own plan, after spending millions of dollars developing a plan for Macquarie Point. They paid them millions of dollars to not build those houses. That is an utter shame. It is an indictment and a stain on the reputation of this government.

There is a clear recommendation from Mr Eslake about public service cuts. He calls efficiency dividends utterly lazy and ineffective. The government has no mandate to deliver this, no mandate whatsoever. The policy that the government took to the last election was not growing back-office public service numbers on a per capita basis:

… a re-elected majority Liberal Government will remain committed to improving the provision of services to the community.

The policy they took to the election was not about cutting. It was about investing in the things that were needed by the Tasmanian people.

There are some parts of the government that are utterly useless and should go. Things like the Office of the Coordinator-General are not doing the work that they were set up to do and are completely focused in the wrong direction. 

I also pay tribute to that treasure of Tasmanian journalism, David Killick. He identified when he was reporting on the minister's press conference announcing the DOGE-like unit to cut efficiency, that the minister turned up with three advisers to his press conference. If the government is looking for efficiencies, they need look no further than home, and make sure that they are making the right decisions and priorities for Tasmanians.

Time expired.

[12.31 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I will start by thanking Mrs Beswick for bringing this very important motion on. It is important that we have these conversations today. I also want to reflect on some of the other comments in this place lauding Labor for our relentless interrogation of the budget that we have been doing, particularly with our shadow treasurer, Josh Willie, asking these questions. It appears as though members have all raised serious concerns this morning about the way the government is managing the budget, and rightly so.

You have eminent economists like Saul Eslake making the comments that he did overnight, absolutely attacking the credibility of the Liberals, which is now in tatters. This is the credibility of an 11-year-old government that has taken Tasmania from having no net debt - in fact $200 million worth of net cash and investments in the bank on 30 June 2014 - to the situation that we are in now, where we are heading towards $10 billion worth of net debt.
What that means for future budgets is that Tasmanians will be paying $500 million every year just to service the debt. That is before they start paying down the debt. They need to start by spending $500 million because of the policy decisions of the Tasmanian Liberal government over 11 years. That is where we have ended up. That is their determination.

Now we see the priorities of Liberals in government under pressure. We see the priorities that they put in front of people. The first thing they did was announce, two budgets ago, an efficiency dividend. Right now they are still refusing to say what this efficiency dividend is doing. This is an efficiency dividend through the departments which Saul Eslake has called lazy, and an efficiency dividend that is likely to have impacts on service delivery.

The government likes to say that they are 'right-sizing' the public service. Who do they think wrong-sized it, if that is true? Who do they think is responsible for wrong-sizing it? There is only one group of people to blame. They have made a hallmark over the course of the last 11 years of blaming everything on Labor. There is no one left to blame but themselves for this budget crisis that they created through their own economic mismanagement. It is not economic mismanagement which is just going to be felt now. This is economic mismanagement which will be felt for decades to come.

It goes to priorities. The first thing they took on was a so-called efficiency dividend. They are so secretive, they will not tell us what it is. The next thing they did was a freeze on new appointments for so-called 'non-essential' public servants. We are now in a situation where across departments, if you have someone leave, there are people being told you cannot replace that position no matter what it is, which can affect all sorts of service delivery. Service delivery the government provides is important and I should not have to tell a government that it is important, but it does impact service delivery.

The next thing they did was put Tasmania's assets up for sale in a fire sale. The budget crisis got so bad that the Premier stood in this place last Tuesday and said, 'I have broken the budget on bankrupting Tasmania and now I have to sell Tasmania's assets to help pay it back'. That is the message that he delivered in his state of the state speech. That was the next thing they did.

They still have not touched some of their most precious things, the things that they really care about. The first one: bridge party. Today, we have uncovered that they are spending almost $100 000 on the so-called bridge party that they want to celebrate themselves at a time when they have frozen the appointment of new public servants - they are throwing themselves a party. At a time when they are selling Tasmanian assets, they are throwing themselves a party. At a time where they have broken Tasmania's budget and we are going to spend half a billion dollars every year servicing the debt, they are throwing themselves a party. Shameful. It shows where their priorities are. 

The one thing that riles them up when it comes to budget management and things they will never touch, and we heard this a little bit again this morning from the Leader of the House, is pork-barrelling. They will go to their graves stopping pork-barrelling and I am pleased that the member for Lyons is here today.

They will do everything they can to make sure that they can continue to pork-barrel every election so they can continue to shovel money out the door for their mates instead of looking after Tasmania's budget and Tasmanians who desperately need it. That is where their priorities are.

[12.37 p.m.]
Mr SHELTON (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to make my contribution to the MPI and I thank the member for Braddon for bringing this on. It is easy to throw stones; it is easy to stand on the sidelines and talk Tasmania down instead of offering real solutions. It is easier to run a fear mongering campaign rather than doing the hard yards and presenting an alternative vision for the state.

What is not easy, is when it requires leadership and developing a responsible plan for Tasmania's future. Every single year Labor has had the opportunity to show Tasmanians how they would manage the state's finances. Every year they have had a chance to present an alternative budget, yet in 10 years they have failed to do so. Not once have they provided a credible plan.

How can Tasmania trust a party that refuses to be upfront about their plans? The honourable leader mentioned the previous election and Labor, through that election committed $4 billion worth of election commitments and claimed that they could save $2 billion in so-called savings, but they refused to explain how. Where will the money come from? What services will they cut and what jobs will go? The answer from Labor is silence.

Even the Greens have presented an alternative budget. The Liberal Party, when in opposition, did the same. What is Labor hiding? The reality is clear; Labor has no plan and if they did, surely they would want to tell us about it. 

Tasmanians deserve better. While Labor refuses to do the work, this government is delivering the results. The 2023-24 budget has been delivered and under a Liberal government the Tasmanian economy is strong. Only last month in February 2025, the National Australia Bank Business Survey ranked Tasmania as No 1 in business confidence and No 2 in business conditions, a full 11 points above the national average.

Our international exports reached $4.5 billion in 2024, an increase of 63 per cent over the decade. Tasmania's mining, aquaculture and farming industries are thriving. Unemployment is at a record low at 4 per cent and has remained below 4.2 per cent for nearly three years. Wages are growing at 3.9 per cent, 0.7 per cent above the national average, which means that there is more money in the pockets of Tasmanians. This is what good economic management looks like. This government has always been responsible with Tasmania's finances. Before COVID-19 we consistently delivered surplus budgets. When the pandemic hit, we made the right decisions to invest $2 billion to protect Tasmanians.

Unlike Labor, we have a responsible plan to repay that debt. We are reinvesting essential services, making Tasmania the best place to live, work and raise a family. We are fully implementing the Commission of Inquiry's recommendations, ensuring victims of historical abuse receive the compensation they deserve. Compare that to those opposite. Labor's financial track record is one Tasmanians will never forget. They start by whingeing about debt, but they are the first to oppose modest efficiencies, and the first to rule out sales of assets under any circumstances. Those opposite are always the first to say we are not spending enough. Tasmania's economy will always be better served under a Liberal government.

Let me correct the record when it comes to those opposite who say we inherited no debt. The 2013-14 Budget Papers make it clear. Quoting the Budget paper, it is estimated that the net debt will be $226.1 million as of 30 June 2014 and will increase in 2015.

Labor and the Greens chartered a pathway to debt for us. The Revised Estimates Report that was released in February 2014 and the Risk Report that we requested Treasury to prepare after we took over the budget we were left with, showed net debt was not zero, but was pushing almost half a billion dollars and the net debt was forecast to increase.

[12.42 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, it is really interesting that the member who just resumed his seat spent his whole contribution on this matter of public importance talking about the Labor Party, when it is actually a very important matter that has been raised by the member for Braddon, Mrs Beswick. It is very easy to talk about politics in here, but difficult to ignore the fundamental issues that Tasmania is facing right now. The member spent a lot of time talking about the Labor Party not preparing an alternative budget, but what we have seen over 11 years is 11 years of failed Liberal Party budgets: 11 years of failed management of the budget by the Liberal Party that has led us to the worst net debt that Tasmania has ever seen.

It is true to say that they inherited money in the bank when they came to government in 2014: $200 million of money in the bank that they have squandered and we are now heading towards the worst budget disaster that Tasmania has seen. As other speakers have said, Saul Eslake has said that budget failure of where we are right now, is directly attributable to Liberal Party policy decisions.

There is a little bit of grace and room for movement in the first months, maybe the first year of a new government to be able to blame the outgoing government for what they inherit, but 11 years on it just does not pass the pub test anymore. It does not pass the pub test anymore to have the Liberal Party constantly harking back to 11 years ago, when what history shows us is that the Liberals are not good managers of money. They are not good budget managers. After 11 years of government from the Liberal Party, we can see that they are not good managers of Tasmania's finances. Where they get off having this reputation as being good budget management, I will never understand, because what we see under 11 years of Liberal Party government is the worst net debt this state has ever seen. 

What have they had to resort to now because of their 11 years of budget mismanagement? They are looking at selling off public assets: selling off things like the buses, and our power supply. States that have done that have seen a massive increase in prices for their citizens, and that is what Tasmanians are going to see too. If Metro is sold to the highest bidder, we will see decisions being made in the interests of a private board and not in the interests of Tasmanian citizens. If TasNetworks is put on a 99-year lease - let us face it, it is the same as selling the place. We will see power prices go up for Tasmanians. That is what has been seen in other states that have privatised their power supply. 

I might be a little bit untraditional here, but I believe that government  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=30.0_C=0.85] has a responsibility to its citizens to provide core services, providing things like power, water, transport. Those are essential services of government and the government has a moral and a social obligation to provide those to their citizens. In Tasmania, the Liberal Party has managed the Budget so badly that they are looking at selling off these prime public assets that Tasmanians rely on every day and cannot afford higher bus fares, cannot afford  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.4_D=9.5_C=0.83] higher power prices and cannot afford higher car registration, which is what we will see under this privatisation agenda.

ELECTORAL AMENDMENT (ALTERNATIVE VOTING PROCEDURES) BILL 2025 (NO. 4)

Second Reading

Resumed from 11 March 2025 (page 124).

Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Minister for Justice) - Honourable Speaker, I had just started my summing up. In doing so, I want to thank members - well, the  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=106.8_D=1.7_C=0.92] opposition attorney-general,  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=109.2_D=26.8_C=0.84] who was not here in the last little bit of the debate for other reasons. I wanted to indicate my thanks to those who have spoken in support of this very important reform measure in terms of our electoral laws and ensuring that there are alternative voting procedures for Tasmanians with a vision impairment or with some form of disability. 

In my opening remarks,  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=136.8_D=1.7_C=0.88] I want to give a tribute  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=139.6_D=29.4_C=0.86] to Minister Jo Palmer. Minister Jo Palmer is the Minister for Women and the Prevention of Family Violence, and for Education, but has been a very strong advocate for this reform and raised it with me last year following feedback from Disability Voices Australia, Blind Citizens Australia and Advocate and their advocates. I subsequently met them last year as well. I want to  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=169.1_D=11.4_C=0.77] say to Jackson Reynolds-Ryan from Blind Citizens Australia, to Duncan Leading and Vaughn Bennison from Disability Voices Australia, you have made a difference.  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=181.4_D=27.2_C=0.87] You have made a difference for people with disabilities in Tasmania with this legislation. I want to say thank you for that. 

I acknowledge Jo Palmer for her advocacy. It has been very strong. I do not think you could find a more committed and caring and generous Minister for Women and the Prevention of Family Violence and for Disability Services.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=210.2_D=3.8_C=0.83] If you go back and look at her first speech, you will see her  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=214.3_D=26.4_C=0.84] history and background and experience with her family, which is on the public record. There is no doubt in my mind of that authentic commitment. In fact, I know Jo Palmer and her commitment. I have known her pretty much all of her life. Indeed, I knew her dear parents Don and Di. I visited her late father, Don,  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=241.6_D=2.7_C=0.69] when he was at Eskleigh.  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=245.1_D=28.4_C=0.86] My late mum and dad were good friends with Don and Diane Dick. I wanted to acknowledge that. It is on the public record. People do know that. They are aware of that. You cannot get a more dedicated, committed minister for the people with disabilities in Tasmania to want to make a difference. Guess what, Jo Palmer? You have. I acknowledge you, your office, your family members, and [Bookmark: Phr16_O=274.3_D=1.2_C=0.96]  thank you for your advocacy.  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=275.8_D=29.2_C=0.87] It has been fantastic. 

We are making a difference in this place. I have acknowledged all those who support this legislative reform. I would now like to go through some of the questions that were raised during the debate. I will attempt to answer those questions, to put it on the record for us here in this place, and for those in the other place who may be interested, and indeed, members of the public. In terms of those questions: will individual electors or groups of electors need to apply to the commission for an alternative voting procedure? The commission is able to act on its own motion to approve alternative voting procedures; however, the amendments also provide a mechanism for accessibility and inclusion for organisations to raise the need for alternative voting procedures with the commission.

'Accessibility and inclusion organisations' is defined in the bill and includes any organisational peak body that focuses on advocacy support or services for people with diverse needs, whether from disability, special needs, impairment or other circumstances. It also means any organisation, group or body approved by the commission. It does not prevent individuals or other groups from raising a need with the commission, in which case the commission could then act on its own motion to approve alternative procedures, and the commission could also approve an additional organisation not covered in section 130B(a) as an accessibility and inclusion organisation. I put that on the record. 

Ms Haddad spoke about the importance of the Tasmanian Electoral Commission (TEC) being an independent entity, and I absolutely concur with that. I thank you for that observation. The independence of the Electoral Commission is - across Australia - so important and particularly in Tasmania. We back it in and we thank the commission for their work.

There should not be any undue influence in those elections, whether it be from the executive or the parliament or members of the community. It is an independent commission undertaking that important work. I was going to say in my opening remarks, and I will say it now, with regard to democracy, and that is what we are on about. We are about improving democracy and the right for people to have a say, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of religion and the right to have a vote and express your views.

An engaged democracy, a proactive engaged democracy is the best form of democracy that we can possibly have and I encourage that. Getting feedback from members of the public is so important for members of parliament and I acknowledge that as well and those in this Chamber I am sure would agree with those principles.

There was the question about local government elections. The government is currently inviting public comment on forward-looking reforms to how we conduct local government elections in Tasmania. I want to pay tribute to our Minister for Local Government, Kerry Vincent, who is very dedicated. He has that long history with local government as a leader and as a mayor for Sorell, but as a leader in this space, and I cannot think of a more capable, competent minister for local government. He is getting that feedback at the moment. This new framework will be implemented through a new stand-alone local government electoral bill and supporting regulations which will be put in place ahead of the next council elections due in October 2026. That is my advice. There is a discussion paper and I wanted to draw that to your attention as well. 

With regard to what services are currently provided by the commission for electors with disability, that is outlined in Section 113 of the Electoral Act. The commission can approve procedures 'that are reasonable and appropriate to assist an elector at an ordinary pre-poll or mobile polling place who is unable to vote without assistance'. The commissioner has approved under this section, the computerised VI Vote, a system for blind and vision-impaired electors. The system is available at designated polling places and provides enhanced audio, visual and printing capabilities to enable independent voting for people with vision impairment or low vision. The commission has also approved procedures under Section 113 that allows electors to nominate another person to help them fill in a ballot paper and/or have an election official bring in a ballot paper to the elector outside a polling place if the elector is, due to disability, unable to enter. 

The commission currently provides an approved telephone voting service under sections 131 and 132 of the Electoral Act but its use is limited to electors who are travelling interstate or overseas or who are in Antarctica or another remote location. I discussed that in my second reading speech. 

Will individual electors or groups of electors need to apply? I have covered off that quite well already with regard to consulting with accessibility and inclusion organisations when developing the alternative procedures. Certainly there is an expectation that consultation will be occurring as far as practicable.

Why must the commission only be satisfied as far as practicable? Authentication and the secrecy of the vote are fundamental elements of our voting system, and that was raised by Michael Ferguson in his contribution; the secrecy of that vote in the privacy of the polling booth. It is very important in terms of upholding democracy and the rule of law, which is, as Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, I want to emphasise is so important. I could say more about that. Mr Ferguson asked about the integrity and privacy of  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.4_D=23.8_C=0.82] the telephone voting process. Once these important reforms have been implemented for electors wishing to vote who call the TEC with, for example, a print disability, would simply be asked to confirm this reason for using the service when they call to register. They would not have to provide evidence as to their disability and this is to respect the privacy of the elector.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=55.8_D=9.0_C=0.59] I am advised the telephone voting process is conducted in two stages. When an elector calls the TEC wishing to register for telephone voting, they are identified on a roll,  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=65.2_D=30.0_C=0.83] given a code and linked to a division. The voter is then transferred to a separate second stage. Once transferred, two people are identified to the voter, one to hear the vote and register it on behalf of the voter, the other person audits the vote and ensures that it is accurate and registered against the accurate code. If at the end of the transcription process the elector is satisfied with how their vote has been recorded, the ballot paper is placed in the allocated ballot box and the first team member marks the unique code as having voted on the  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=95.8_D=29.5_C=0.78] code validation system. At this point, the system will not permit a new or second ballot paper to be issued to that elector. This process has been tested through the COVID-19 pandemic and is seen as the most effective means of ensuring that the independence of an elector's vote is upheld with the utmost integrity and that the process remains private. 

Mr Ferguson asked: is there anything in the act preventing someone from disclosing how a person using [Bookmark: Phr6_O=125.4_D=29.7_C=0.75]  alternative voting procedures voted? The proposed new Section 130F provides that votes from approved alternative voting procedures are not to be disclosed except in accordance with the requirements of the procedure itself. That is in line with the existing Section 136 relating to votes cast under approved procedures from Antarctica, remote areas and outside Tasmania. It provides that any person who becomes aware of how an elector voting in accordance with the procedures under the section [Bookmark: Phr7_O=155.3_D=27.8_C=0.79]  voted is not to disclose this information to any other person except in accordance with approved procedure. Further integrity protections such as offences relating to acts by polling officials when carrying out their duties already contained in part seven of the act. There is a general provision offence that I note in Section 179 subsection B. There are some similar laws in other jurisdictions. I think I have touched on that in my  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=183.6_D=5.0_C=0.75] earlier contribution, and I have covered off on the penalty for disclosing how a person using  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=188.8_D=14.0_C=0.81] alternative voting procedures voted as well.

It has been quite a comprehensive debate in the time available at the end. I want to again thank you for that. We have had a public consultation, and we have received  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=202.9_D=24.6_C=0.86] feedback on that. I want to thank all those organisations that have provided feedback. I want to thank my department support Felicity Poulter, Michelle Davey and others within the department. Thank you so much for that support and consulting with members across the Chamber. In the time available, I want to commend this bill to the Chamber. It is a very exciting  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=228.4_D=4.4_C=0.91] reform that will deliver improved democracy and the rule of law.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=233.3_D=29.7_C=0.85] I am most encouraged by the feedback that I have received during this debate from honourable members from all sides, crossbench included. I know it is particularly important to certain members of the community. I pay tribute to you, and as I said earlier, thank you so much for your advocacy to make a difference. You have brought that to me, to minister Palmer and to our government to make a difference. You have made a difference and I commend this bill to the House.

INAUGURAL SPEECH

Member for Lyons - Mr Casey Farrell

The SPEAKER - The Standing Orders have allowed for debate to be suspended to allow the member for Lyons, Mr Farrell, to provide his inaugural speech today to the parliament. I remind members of the courtesy that we extend during members' first speeches. With that I call for his first contribution to the Tasmanian Parliament, other than those interjections, the honourable member for Lyons, Mr Farrell.

Mr FARRELL (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I am pleased to be here where I am now able to speak to you. I thank you for allowing me to give my first speech to the parliament.

In recognition of the deep history and culture of this island, I acknowledge Palawa, the Tasmanian Aboriginal people, as the original owners and continuing custodians of Lutruwita/Tasmania. I pay my respect to elders past and present.

I thank the people of Lyons for selecting me as their next best option after Rebecca White. We had a great field of candidates who each campaigned very hard. This is proven by the closeness of the count. I am certain we will see their names on ballot papers in the future. Rebecca has been a phenomenal and generous mentor and a kind friend. I wish her the very best for her campaign and apologise that my election has inconveniently disrupted my availability to help.

I thank my family, my kids: Tess who is there, and Austin and Matilda upstairs, for their understanding and excitement for this new chapter, and their mother, Kylie, who convinced me to run, worked so very hard on my campaign, and fights the good fight every day of her life as a union organiser. My parents, siblings, in-laws, nieces, nephews: everyone has played a part in getting to this moment and I thank you.

Thanks to my campaign team for their incredible work. It seems to have finally paid off. It really does take a lot of people to run a decent campaign, as everyone in the Chamber would know. I am really humbled that you chose to get behind me. A special shout-out to Dave, who ran the campaign. I know it was not easy, but you always managed to maintain a smile, at least with me.

 [Bookmark: _Hlk192774128] To my friends, particularly Amy, Maddy, Kelly, Griffin and Cecily, thank you for your endless support. I hope you already know how much I appreciate you.

Most members in their inaugural speeches reflect on where their interest in politics began. It may not surprise members present that my interest was born in my childhood home. Yes, the highly respected, enormously influential political powerhouse of the  [Bookmark: _Hlk192774156] Farrell family: my mum, Lee. She is a woman of boundless resourcefulness, quiet influence and unwavering principle.

Mum grew up on a farm in Pyengana and worked as a potter for most of my life. More accurately, she was an artist of fine ceramics with a home studio and gallery, but being insufferably humble, she would shy away from words that elevated her craft. She retired from pottery when the cost of production soared, and despite our very best efforts, we could never convince her to raise her prices. For Mum, her pottery was not for the purpose of making money, it was about creating accessible, functional beauty - dinnerware that was affordable enough to belong on everybody's dinner table.

Mum's core belief in fairness and equality is matched by a drive for participation. In 1983, as a teenager, she managed to convince her farming parents to vote for Bob Hawke in order to save the Franklin River. That victory reinforced her conviction that every person can make a difference in a democracy, and that parliament is the ultimate place for meaningful, positive change. I know that I would never have considered running for Parliament without my mum's influence, and I do not think Dad would have either. I am really glad that we both did.

Sincerely and obviously, my Dad - sorry, the honourable my Dad - has been a huge influence on my interest in politics. He never tells me what I should do. Sometimes it is really, really difficult to uncover his true opinion. That is why, until recently, most of my understanding of Tasmanian politics came from his meme page.

Watching the way he carries himself in the community and in parliament, the things he values and the fights that he will take on, has been inspirational. Like Dad, I will seek to conduct myself in a collaborative, trustworthy and respectful way. I will not take myself too seriously, but I will take my responsibility here and my commitment to the people of Lyons and Tasmania extremely seriously.

When I was born, home was in the foothills of Mount Dromedary, just outside Bridgewater. I started school at Brighton Primary. My family moved to New Norfolk when I was six. I bought my first house in New Norfolk, built a family home in Molesworth, and now I am back in New Norfolk. I have not gone far, but why would you?

I am not just a Farrell from the Derwent Valley. I am connected to so many places all around this island because my family is from all over the place.  [Bookmark: _Hlk192774335] I am a Healey and a LeFevre from Pyengana, a Browning from National Park, a Templeton from Campbell Town, a Gillard from Deloraine, a Porter from Ross, a Salter from Fingal, an Andrews from Anthill Ponds, and a MacMichael from St Helens, just to name a few. While I am proudly a Farrell from the Derwent Valley, I carry with me the history, the values and the deep connections of families from all over this great state. My roots are firmly planted in Tasmania's past and my purpose here is about shaping its future.

Every elected member knows that interest in politics is never the reason for nominating for parliament. We are here because we are prepared to dedicate our lives to make positive change for the people of our electorates and the people of Tasmania.

I am going to share with you a few short anecdotes from my life, experiences and interactions that have had great impact on me, shaped who I am and have led me to this place. They will give you an idea of what I value and what I would like for you to expect from me in this House.

My first story is about opportunity. I studied technology at university and my first job in the industry was with a Sydney-based multinational. I started in the tech support team, and in a growing business in a booming industry sector there were many opportunities for promotion. Six years in, I was working as a technical consultant and discussed with the manager what the next steps of my career could look like. He offered me a job in Sydney or London, or in the new office in the United States. When I told him that I wanted to stay in Tasmania, he told me that the opportunities were just not going to be here anymore, that in order to succeed in my career, I would have to leave. I refused to accept that. I quit my job and started a creative tech business. Within a year, I had hired my first employee, and by the end of the next year, we were a team of four.

It has always been deeply ingrained that the purpose of that business is to provide great opportunities for Tasmanians to do their best work on a world stage. I am incredibly proud of what the team has achieved and continues to achieve as they lead themselves into the future.

My next story is about inspiration. Alongside starting my own business, I joined a group of entrepreneurs who had started the beginnings of an industry peak body for start-ups. They had established a co-working space in the basement of a shop in Murray Street in Hobart. It was dark and it was grungy. Most of the furniture was broken and the Wi-Fi was terribly unreliable but the atmosphere was electric. The place was full of people working on fascinating tech, brainstorming business ideas together, inspired by the global lean start-up movement and, most importantly, it featured a massive plumbed-in commercial espresso machine.

When we were told the space was going to become unavailable to us, I organised a group of businesses to establish a new co-working space, the Typewriter Factory, which was opened by Premier Lara Giddings in 2012. When we grew out of that in less than three years, we moved into a space three times the size in the old Mercury building and became factory floor.

These spaces over the years gave the Tasmanian start-up community a home. It brought founders, creatives and technologists together, allowing us to prove that it was an industry sector that was worth nurturing and prove it we did. 

In 2016, the Tasmanian government announced funding to help establish a start-up incubator with hubs in Hobart and Launceston. I acknowledge the huge support provided to the project by the member for Bass, Mr Ferguson. Thank you. If you go back through the Mercury archives to 6 March 2016, you will find a photo of a slightly younger me with a slightly younger Mr Ferguson launching these hubs - but I strongly recommend against doing that because seeing that photo will give you a startling realisation of how long ago 2016 was.

I served on the board of the incubator, Enterprize, for a couple of years and then took the role of running it from 2018 right up to earlier this year. In that time, Enterprize grew from a tiny charity entirely dependent on government funding to a significant economic player with two nation-leading incubator programs, a fantastic schools program teaching high school students how they can become entrepreneurs and over 200 users of the hubs.

Being part of the journey with hundreds of entrepreneurs through the years has given me an immense amount of confidence and excitement about the future for Tasmania. It has also taught me a lot about the power of optimism in the face of risk and uncertainty, the value of turning fear into hope, and that while almost nothing is impossible, some things are really difficult.

My third story is about winning. When I was young, school holidays would often be spent at my grandparents' farm in Pyengana. Sometimes, my siblings and I were able to participate, shifting the irrigation, herding the cows and everyone's favourite - picking up the rocks in the paddock [Bookmark: Phr2_O=6.8_D=13.2_C=0.84] . Often, our time would be spent across the paddock in the old house with my great grandmother, Ivy, and her black Labrador. Gran would get our help with the crossword, teach us board games and, occasionally, drive us around to the shop to get a pie for lunch.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=21.1_D=6.3_C=0.85] On one visit as a young, annoying kid when Mum suggested I spend the day with Gran playing cards and board games,  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=27.8_D=6.5_C=0.88] I complained that she was not very good at them, she never won, and that I did not understand why she bothered with the crossword [Bookmark: Phr5_O=34.4_D=10.4_C=0.77]  because she always asked for help with every answer. It was not until years later that I realised Gran was not playing to win, she was making sure the game was worth playing.  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=45.7_D=9.1_C=0.86] It is the same reason that Rusty hits his little sister a catch, because in life, it is not about keeping score, it is about keeping people in the game.

Members - Hear, hear.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=57.0_D=1.0_C=0.38] Mr FARRELL - My fourth story is about learning. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=66.8_D=12.1_C=0.85]  A family friend for nearly 30 years of my life and New Norfolk legend, Ken O'Brien, who passed away just over a year ago after making it to a century taught me my next lesson after a family dinner when I was in my teens.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=80.1_D=5.0_C=0.82] Ken was a successful business operator, a war veteran and an incredibly hard worker.  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=86.2_D=5.6_C=0.87] When building his family shack, Ken was on the tools himself, but work was busy and he needed some help.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=92.5_D=12.8_C=0.80] He paid for a local building labourer to help him out and was astounded by the young man's shovelling efficiency. He remarked to him about how fit and strong he must be and was told in reply, 'I just know how to shovel properly'.  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=106.3_D=3.4_C=0.81] He taught Ken how and Ken remembered that for the rest of his life.  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=110.5_D=7.6_C=0.91] Ken told me that there is always something to learn from everybody you meet and something that you can teach them. Do not miss the opportunity.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=120.2_D=2.4_C=0.89] My fifth story is about trust.  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=123.8_D=6.6_C=0.90] For over 20 years, my GP was Dr Ralph Peters, a kind, empathetic gentleman and exceptional doctor.  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=131.4_D=16.0_C=0.88] Dr Peters cared so deeply about his community and about each of the individuals in it. He never rushed his appointments, always had a holistic interest in his patient's wellbeing and would always answer his phone or his door on the weekend if you needed help. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=148.7_D=5.5_C=0.85]  It was not until his funeral that I learned that this kind, gentle soul had been a fighter for his own freedom.  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=155.0_D=9.4_C=0.88] He had fought against apartheid in South Africa and fled his home for the safety of his young family. He settled for a new life in New Norfolk and the community embraced them all.  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=165.2_D=2.0_C=0.88] No wonder he cared so deeply for us. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=168.4_D=12.8_C=0.82]  Dr Peters saved my life once when I was a teenager by relentlessly pushing surgeons who disagreed with his diagnosis until they gave in and performed the surgery I needed. I am forever thankful to him.  [Bookmark: Phr22_O=182.9_D=8.0_C=0.90] 

What stood out most about Dr Peters was not just his medical expertise, it was his kindness, honesty and deep respect for people.  [Bookmark: Phr23_O=191.6_D=5.8_C=0.91] Those were the building blocks of the trust he had in our community - kindness, honesty and respect.

 [Bookmark: Phr24_O=200.0_D=2.4_C=0.92] My final story is about purpose.  [Bookmark: Phr25_O=203.8_D=28.9_C=0.85] The team at Enterprize established a tradition of hot chip days. If something happened that was particularly challenging, or on the flip side, if we had something to celebrate, we would declare it a hot chip day, a chance for a break from the office and to share some comfort food. The team would know that a hot chip day was inevitable if they walked past my office and heard me playing a certain speech given by Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple and Pixar at the 2005 Stanford commencement ceremony. [Bookmark: Phr26_O=233.7_D=2.7_C=0.74]  I am definitely a nerd at heart and this speech is a favourite.  [Bookmark: Phr27_O=237.6_D=6.5_C=0.85] I am paraphrasing a bit, but one of the lines that sticks with me from this speech is, 'Your time is limited, so do not waste it'.  [Bookmark: Phr28_O=245.3_D=6.4_C=0.81] Jobs is reflecting on life in general, but this is also very solid advice for parliamentarians, particularly new ones.

 [Bookmark: Phr29_O=252.6_D=4.6_C=0.83] We are all in this place for a limited amount of time and I will not be wasting it.  [Bookmark: Phr30_O=258.4_D=7.6_C=0.84] I have been provided a privilege and responsibility by the voters of Lyons and I will be using it to make as much positive change as I can.

 [Bookmark: Phr31_O=269.1_D=23.9_C=0.85] I have been responsible for managing people for most of my career and my management style has always been focused on getting the most value from the creativity and knowledge of the staff that I managed. As a manager, I would do whatever I could to make sure there was nothing in their way. I believe that this is the role of government to do what is required to allow Tasmanians to do their very best. 

 [Bookmark: Phr32_O=294.4_D=10.4_C=0.77] Do not wilfully misinterpret me. I am no advocate for small government, because small government is just vacant management. No, the right way to get out of the way is to make sure everyone has everything they need to focus on their job, to ensure the foundation is solid so they do not have to think about it.  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=12.6_D=12.5_C=0.91] As government, this means providing a healthcare system so reliable that people never worry that they will not be able to get the care they need. It means providing the best educational opportunities to every single person.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=26.0_D=18.3_C=0.87] It means running a reliable, affordable public transport system so that people can get from their homes to where the opportunities are. It means providing shelter to everyone who needs it. It means providing social and economic leadership such that everyone has access to safe, secure and well paid work.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=45.6_D=4.6_C=0.93] Imagine the things that Tasmanians can achieve if we get these things right.  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=51.1_D=8.5_C=0.89] If everyone has the confidence to do things that are a little bit risky, a bit out there, to explore the unknown and discover the unrealised opportunity [Bookmark: Phr6_O=60.5_D=11.4_C=0.88] , that is the Tasmania that I would like to see. It is the Tasmania I want my kids to grow up in, because I do not ever want them to think there is anything they have to leave home to be able to achieve.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=73.3_D=1.0_C=0.65] Honourable Speaker,  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=75.3_D=13.2_C=0.86] we are only in this place for a limited time. I will not waste mine. The people of Lyons have given me a responsibility, and I will use it to drive real, lasting change. So, let us get on with it.

Members - Hear, hear.


RECOGNITION OF VISITORS

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=98.6_D=7.6_C=0.81] The SPEAKER - Honourable members, they did leave the gallery, but I will acknowledge that the year 11 and 12 legal studies students from Fahan School were watching that speech today.  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=106.7_D=12.6_C=0.80] 

I also acknowledge in the gallery the President of the other place. Thank you for joining us.

Members - Hear, hear.

Mr Farrell - He is called honourable Dad.

The SPEAKER - I do not think I can call him honourable Dad; that would be really weird.  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=121.4_D=4.7_C=0.71] Also, the thing about us not being here very long, I do not know about that. 


JUSTICE MISCELLANEOUS (ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW TRIBUNAL) BILL 2024 (No. 36)

Second Reading

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=140.7_D=0.8_C=0.58] [2.48 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Minister for Justice) -  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=148.6_D=17.8_C=0.83] Before I speak on the bill, on indulgence, I congratulate the member for Lyons, Casey Farrell. It was an outstanding presentation. I am very proud to see your family members here and other friends as well. Congratulations from me. I look forward to working with you to make a positive difference.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=167.8_D=0.9_C=0.67] Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the bill  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=170.7_D=3.1_C=0.89] now be read a second time.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=174.8_D=28.4_C=0.88] In May 2024, the Australian Parliament passed legislation to replace the Administrative Appeals Tribunal with the Administrative Review Tribunal. The legislation that governs the tribunal would also change, with the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 being repealed and the Commonwealth Administrative Review Tribunal Act 2024 replacing it.  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=204.4_D=5.0_C=0.81] The new Commonwealth legislation commenced on 14 October 2024.  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=210.6_D=10.5_C=0.91] Transitional provisions within the Commonwealth law mean that the Administrative Review Tribunal is up and running, and Tasmanians can already access it. 

 [Bookmark: Phr21_O=222.4_D=11.4_C=0.85] The jurisdiction of the Administrative Review Tribunal is nearly identical to that of the previous Administrative Appeals Tribunal, but some changes have been made to the practices and procedures that apply.  [Bookmark: Phr22_O=235.5_D=16.9_C=0.86] For example, the new Commonwealth legislation implements recommendations from three recent reviews and inquiries, including changing the appointment process of members to the tribunal, making improvements to procedural fairness  [Bookmark: Phr23_O=253.1_D=24.9_C=0.85] and requiring the publication of certain decisions. There are 12 pieces of Tasmanian legislation that currently refer to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act. The purpose of this bill is to ensure that all references to the federal tribunal and references to the laws that govern it are up to date in Tasmanian law.

 [Bookmark: Phr24_O=278.8_D=5.7_C=0.69] Parts 2 through to 13 of the bill make the necessary consequential amendments  [Bookmark: Phr25_O=284.9_D=3.5_C=0.88] to the following pieces of Tasmanian legislation:  [Bookmark: Phr26_O=289.6_D=15.3_C=0.86] the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Tasmania) Act 1994, the Competition Policy Reform (Tasmania) Act 1996, the Corporations (Tasmania) Act 1990, the Federal Courts (State Jurisdiction) Act 1999, the Gene Technology (Tasmania) Act 2012, the Human Embryonic Research Regulation Act 2003, the Legal Profession (Board of Legal Education) Rules 2021, the Marine Safety (Domestic Commercial Vessel National Law Application) Act 2013, the New Tax System Price Exploitation Code (Tasmania) Act 1999, the Terrorism (Preventative Detention) Act 2005, the Therapeutic Goods Act 2001 and the Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act 2013.

Most of the bill's provision simply substitute relevant terms to reflect the new Administrative Review Tribunal and its governing legislation. The only amendment that changes the operation of Tasmanian law is contained within clause 30 of the bill. That clause amends Section 51 of the Terrorism (Preventative Detention) Act 2005 to remove the requirement for the annual report prepared under the act by the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice to include the number of preventative detention orders and prohibited contact orders that the tribunal has declared to be void.

This reflects that the new Administrative Review Tribunal no longer has the power to declare such orders void. Given the serious nature of these orders, it is appropriate for these decisions to only be made by a court through judicial review and not by a tribunal through administrative review.

Clause 2 of the bill provides for the bill to commence on the day on which the Commonwealth's Administrative Review Tribunal Act 2024 commences, even if the Commonwealth act commences before this bill receives royal assent. This clause ensures that the technical changes to Tasmanian legislation will apply retrospectively and our laws will operate from 14 October 2024.

The changes that the bill makes are minor and consequential in nature and they do not affect the policy that underlines any of the Tasmanian legislation that is proposed to be amended.

Honourable Speaker, I commend the bill to the House.

[2.54 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, it will not surprise the House or the Attorney-General to know that the opposition will be supporting the Justice Miscellaneous (Administrative Review Tribunal) Bill 2024, In providing that support, I will provide some brief comments to the House noting that the bill simply changes references to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), which now no longer exists and has been replaced by new tribunal of a different name, the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART), a Commonwealth tribunal referred to in Tasmanian legislation. 

There are 12 pieces of Tasmanian legislation, as we heard the Attorney-General outline, and those 12 pieces of legislation will have their reference to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal replaced with reference to the Administrative Review Tribunal.

As we heard, the Attorney-General say, there is only one substantive change to Tasmanian law, which is about the reporting of how many preventative detention orders and prohibitive conduct orders the tribunal has declared void. The reason for that is that the Administrative Review Tribunal no longer holds that power and I wondered if the Attorney-General could answer in his summing up comments where that information will be reported in future if it is still to be reported.

What the Attorney-General said in his final comments is quite true. The changes that this bill makes are minor and consequential in nature and they do not affect the policy that underlines any of the Tasmanian legislation that is being amended, simply changing a reference to a now abolished tribunal with references to its replacement. 

I could not let the opportunity of debating this bill go past without making some unsolicited comments about why that change was made by the Commonwealth government.  As members would know, the former AAT, that has now been replaced by the ART, is a federal administrative review system for appealing decisions made under Commonwealth laws, including those related to Centrelink, child support, migration, refugee visa applications, taxation, freedom of information decisions, which is the Commonwealth version of our right to information and the NDIS. They are fundamental building blocks of Australia's democracy and administrative review is a fundamental tenant of our legal system.

The work that the AAT did, that the ART now has responsibility for, is fundamentally important decisions that affect the very fabric of Australian society and affect the lives of individuals who take matters to the tribunal.

When the Albanese government was first elected, one of the first things that Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, did was make an announcement that he was going to be abolishing the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and replacing it with a new administrative body that better serves the interests of the Australian community. That was announced very early in the administration of the Albanese government. I want to share with the House some of the words that the Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, said when he made that announcement:

The AATs public standing has been irreversibly damaged as a result of the actions of the former government over nine years.

That is the Morrison government and their predecessors.

They've appointed 85 former Liberal MPs, failed Liberal candidates, former Liberal staffers and other close Liberal associates without any merit-based selection process, including some individuals with no relevant experience or expertise. The former government fatally compromised the AAT, undermined its independence and eroded the quality and efficiency of its decision making. This was a disgraceful exhibition of cronyism by the Liberal Party.

The AATs dysfunction has had a very real cost to the tens of thousands of people who rely on the AAT each year to independently review government decisions that have major and sometimes life changing impacts on their lives.

Decisions such as whether an older Australian receives an aged pension. Whether a veteran is compensated for a service injury or whether a participant in the NDIS receives funding for essential support.
The Albanese Government is committed to delivering a new, accessible, sustainable and trusted administrative review tribunal that serves the interests of the Australian people.

The central pillar will be a new transparent, merit-based appointment process.

The new body will be properly funded. We will reduce the ongoing delays currently experienced by those seeking review of Government decisions. The new body will have a modern, reliable and fit-for-purpose case management system that delivers administrative efficiencies for all users.

It might sound like quite an extraordinary step for an incoming attorney-general very early in the government's days to completely abolish a longstanding administrative tribunal, but Mr Dreyfus had no choice other than to make that decision because the Liberal Party had stacked the AAT with their mates. They had stacked the AAT with failed Liberal candidates, former Liberal MPs, former Liberal staffers and others with close links and ties to the Liberal Party.

There would be many people who are qualified to serve on the ART or its predecessor, the AAT, who might have links to the Liberal Party. The criticism is not simply that those people had a link to the Liberal Party. The criticism and the mess that Mr Dreyfus was left to fix is that people who did not have the skills to serve in those jobs had been appointed to do a very important quasi-judicial job: people who did not have any experience in administrative review law; people who did not have any experience in public sector administration. The result of that was a massive delay, a massive backlog.

The very next thing that Mr Dreyfus did was employ a surge workforce of 75 people to address that backlog, a temporary surge workforce to get through that huge log of cases that were sitting there undecided in an inefficient system stacked with Liberal mates. The second thing they did was to move to a merits-based appointment system, which is the right thing to do. All the existing members had to reapply for their appointment. People with links to the Liberal Party, people with links to the Labor Party, private citizens, it did not matter - everybody needed to reapply for their positions on the newly established Administrative Review Tribunal. They have maintained a merits-based appointment process since that time. It is a real lesson for government that stacking tribunals or other  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.5_D=1.0_C=0.82] agencies [Bookmark: Phr3_O=30.9_D=30.0_C=0.83]  with people without considering meritorious appointment is a really dangerous and short-sighted thing to do.

It led not just to those inefficiencies and backlogs, but also to a really toxic culture in the former AAT with lots of allegations of bullying. The National Secretary of the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU), Melissa Donnelly at the time, said that that reform of the [Bookmark: Phr4_O=61.3_D=7.1_C=0.70]  AAT was long overdue. They said staff had been really stressed about the tribunals and the way it was being managed. She said:

The AAT has become a workplace increasingly plagued with poor culture, unreasonable workloads and significant bullying and harassment complaints.

…

The AAT has lost the confidence of the public and many of its employees after years of partisan appointments and significant increases in workplace bullying and harassment.
 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=68.8_D=24.9_C=0.83] 
The opposition welcomes this bill.  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=94.8_D=1.8_C=0.80] It is right and proper that we [Bookmark: Phr7_O=98.7_D=7.2_C=0.70]  amend Tasmanian legislation when it refers to bodies that no longer exist. We have done that many times before with justice miscellaneous bills.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=106.5_D=25.2_C=0.84] It is also a very important lesson to everybody about the importance of not stacking tribunals with your mates and the importance of merit-based appointments to jobs like this. I really wish the new ART very well in repairing that culture. I very much hope they can continue to be governed by someone with the integrity and the foresight of Mr Dreyfus long into the future.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=135.5_D=1.0_C=0.68]  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=141.4_D=25.1_C=0.77] [3.03 a.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Deputy Speaker, I thank the Attorney-General and the minister for bringing this on. The Greens will also be supporting this bill. As the shadow attorney-general, Ms Haddad, has just said, it is solely comprising very minor changes: two names, from the pre-existing  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=167.0_D=4.2_C=0.80] Administrative Appeals Tribunal to the now existing Administrative Review Tribunal.

Yes, Ms Haddad - what a horror show it was in 2013 to something like 2022. Under the federal Liberal government, it was a series of revolving doors for people who were Liberal mates of the federal Liberal government at the time, people who had left careers as MPs. The former Energy minister Matthew Groom, one time Environment minister here, I believe, got a role on the AAT. So many people did not go through a merits-based process. That is the point. There was no sufficiently strong, and sometimes no credible merits-based process that operated for the appointment of people to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Over time it became more egregious and more extreme. It was really obvious to people who were looking at the lag in work being done: the bloating and the stalling of making decisions on such critical issues as  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=263.9_D=0.8_C=0.75] Centrelink  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=265.3_D=10.1_C=0.76] abuses, particularly by the then government. These are administrative abuses which are having appalling effects on people's lives [Bookmark: Phr20_O=277.2_D=19.5_C=0.79] .

It was a great thing that the incoming Labor government and Mark Dreyfus did when he came into his role by spilling the AAT and starting the process all over again. I think a lot of people in Australia who had been watching - let us face it, not many people understand what the AAT  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=298.1_D=6.9_C=0.91] even was as a body, but for those who did watch, they could see the perversions of justice. They could see the acts of politicisation, the undermining that was occurring of what ought to be and what had been the incredibly important independent role of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. There was  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.4_D=6.0_C=0.72] no critical check on the politicisation of that through a merits-based review [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.9_D=24.2_C=0.81] . Ultimately, there was no critical check on the abuses of power by governments at that time, at the end of that period, particularly in the last nine years where it was stacked with people who were not the right people to sit there and  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=57.0_D=4.6_C=0.82] be in judgment of other people or to take carriage of the cases  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=62.0_D=1.2_C=0.90] that came before them.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=64.5_D=30.0_C=0.89] What was irreversibly damaged has now been substantially improved. The Greens say there is room for improvement. We will continue to fight at the federal level, and always in Tasmania, to make sure that ministers do not get to have a say over the constitution of the boards and the people who sit on the boards to make decisions about  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=94.6_D=23.6_C=0.84] who should be appointed to committees, and do not have any way of controlling the process of appointment of people on those committees. It is essential to have an independent authority who can act as a stop on the perversions of  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=119.7_D=4.7_C=0.83] unjust decisions that can be made by  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=124.8_D=29.7_C=0.88] government officials.

The change to the Administrative Review Tribunal is so welcome. Nothing is perfect in that space. Nothing ever is. It is about constant vigilance. The government of the day - any government of the day, the Labor Party, the Liberals - power, unless it is checked, can become abusive. It is so important that we  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=155.0_D=20.9_C=0.86] stand and have those institutions, the courts and the administrative review tribunals. They are so essential to creating a safe, secure body politic where we can flourish and live our lives without being  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=177.9_D=6.4_C=0.86] subject to cruel, unreasonable, unfair, or unjust decisions [Bookmark: Phr12_O=184.8_D=13.9_C=0.86] . We ought to be able to have the same service and the same treatment as another person. 

We really welcome this bill, small as it is. It closes for Tasmania  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=200.4_D=15.6_C=0.81] a pretty terrible chapter of the abuse of power in Australia's history under what was, in the end days, the Scott Morrison Liberals. The really bad times. I am not saying that we have really great times now,  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=216.6_D=14.0_C=0.74] but there are such things as least worst. There is no doubt about that. I am very glad that we are living in a least worst Australia and long may it remain that way.

[3.10 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=232.7_D=1.1_C=0.62]  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=236.4_D=0.5_C=0.28]  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=238.6_D=27.1_C=0.73] Mr BEHRAKIS (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to rise and speak in support of the Justice Miscellaneous (Administrative Review Tribunal) Bill. I thank the Deputy Premier and the Attorney-General for bringing forward this legislation and the debate we have had so far. The Deputy Premier has had quite the busy week with legislation. It has been good to see. The Australian Government, as we have heard, is replacing the federal Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the AAT, with a new Administrative Review Tribunal.  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=266.6_D=5.6_C=0.60] The Commonwealth Government recently passed legislation that will establish the new tribunal and repeal the Administrative Appeals Act. [Bookmark: Phr19_O=273.2_D=29.4_C=0.84] 

The ART conducts independent reviews of administrative decisions made under a wide range of Commonwealth laws. If someone disagrees with the decision made by an Australian government department, minister or agency, the tribunal gives you an opportunity to have that decision independently reviewed. I completely agree with the remarks by the leader of the Greens. Everyone should have that ability to ensure that they are being treated fairly.

I understand that there are 12 pieces of Tasmanian legislation that refer to the AAT or the AAT  [Bookmark: Phr20_O=302.9_D=0.5_C=0.69] act. We like our legislation to be tidy and as easy to navigate as possible, hence the need to tidy up that legislation to be consistent with the Commonwealth. The ART can review decisions made under more than 400 Commonwealth acts in the legislative instruments. Most common types of decisions that are reviewed relate to visas including migration and refugee visas, Centrelink payments including family assistance, paid parental leave, student assistance, NDIS issues, child support, taxation, Commonwealth workers' compensation and veterans' entitlements, to name a few.

The Justice Miscellaneous Administrative Review Tribunal Bill amends the following legislation to replace references to the AAT and the AAT act with references to the new tribunal and/or its governing legislation in the following bills: the Human Embryonic Research Regulation Act 2003, the Legal Profession Board of Legal Education Rules 2021, the Marine Safety Domestic Commercial Vessel National Law Application Act 2013, the New Tax System Price Exploitation Code 1999, the Terrorism Preventative Detention Act 2005, the Therapeutic Goods Act 2001 and Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Act 2013. These amendments are consequential.

The bill has been drafted to commence on the same day as the Administrative Review Tribunal Act 2024. This is to ensure that it is synchronised and that the Tasmanian legislation does not change before the tribunal is actually ready to undertake that work.

These amendments are technical in nature and they do not change the policy underlying the Tasmanian legislation, it is simply to ensure that this legislation is as tidy and as easy to navigate as possible. If we did not change the name in Tasmania legislation, Tasmanians would still be able to apply to the new Administrative Review Tribunal. This is because of the transitional provision in clause 20 of Schedule 16 to the Administrative Review Tribunal. Consequential and Transitional Provisions (No 1) Act 2024 of the Commonwealth, which ensures that any person who is entitled to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal immediately before the new tribunal commences can apply to the new one instead.

It does not amend Tasmanian legislation and even then, it is still confusing for people trying to read legislation, wondering where it is that they should be going to have those issues listened to and heard and it would also be fundamentally incorrect. 

We need to ensure that these bodies are able to ensure fairness and due process for Tasmanians and Australians alike and it also needs to be ensured that those laws, that legislation is as easy to navigate for Tasmanians, especially those who are in a position where something has gone wrong and they are needing to seek review from the tribunal.

That is what this legislation seeks to accomplish and I commend the bill.

[3.14 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Minister for Justice) - Deputy Speaker, I am very pleased to stand to commend the bill and to wrap up the debate on this bill. First, I acknowledge support for the bill from my shadow representatives in this Chamber. I appreciate that, and I wanted to say thank you for that support.

It is a technical bill and does have the important effect in Tasmania to apply the law relevant to the Administrative Review Tribunal in Tasmania. I would like to respond to a few of the queries that were made relevant for this place, but also for the other place who may have an interest. Before sitting down, I will also respond to some of the unfair criticisms that have been made, particularly with respect to a certain former minister in this place, Matthew Groom. I will have more to say about that shortly. 

Regarding my response to some of the queries about how the bill can commence retrospectively, Australian courts generally apply a presumption against legislation applying retrospectively, but it is to ensure that people are only subject to laws that they know about, to have a reasonable opportunity to know about. Parliaments in Australia are not prohibited by the constitution from creating laws which apply retrospectively and both the Australian and Tasmanian Parliaments have made laws in this manner.

For these laws to be upheld in the courts, there are two things that need to occur. The law must comply with the principle of legality, which requires that any retrospective laws use clear and unambiguous language to make it absolutely clear that the law is to have retrospect effect. This bill has very clear language in clause 2 in order to make this requirement.

Second, the law must be subject to the scrutiny of the parliament. The ability for Tasmanians to assess the Federal Administrative Tribunal is generally contained in federal legislation. I do not see that as an issue.

I would like to respond to the question regarding what the effect is of the amendment in clause 30. It does not appear to be a consequential change of name. The previous AAT had the power to declare preventative detention orders and prohibited contact orders to be void. Under the Tasmanian Terrorism Preventative Detention Act 2005, I am required to prepare an annual report on the operation of the act, in my role as minister for Justice. This report is to contain the number of preventative detention orders and prohibited contact orders that the AAT has declared void.

Clause 30 of the bill amends section 51(2) subsection (f) of the Terrorism Preventive Detention Act 2005, to remove this reporting requirement. This amendment reflects the policy intent of the new Commonwealth Administrative Review Tribunal Act 2024, which removes the tribunal's power to declare preventative detention orders and prohibited contact orders void, meaning that only a court can make this decision. Given the serious nature of these orders it is appropriate for these decisions to only be made by a court through judicial review, and not by a tribunal through administrative review. The amendment means that these numbers no longer have to be reported, as this practice will no longer occur.

I do note on the way through that my department, for which I am very grateful, did make briefings available to relevant crossbenchers and others in this place, and I put on record my sincere thanks in that regard. I particularly want to acknowledge Peter Davis and Mary MacDonald for their support to not just myself, my office, but to other members in this place with respect to this bill.

Ms Haddad did have the question in terms of how well declarations have prevented detention orders and prohibited contact orders reported when they are declared void? I think I have covered that pretty well. Orders will be declared void by a federal court under the new Commonwealth legislation. Such decisions will therefore be part of the Commonwealth reporting requirements rather than the state and this would be included in any report provided by the responsible Commonwealth minister and that is relevant in the Criminal Code Act 1995 in section 104, subsection 29.

In relation to the questions: why there is a new tribunal and how is the new tribunal different from the old one? There has been reference to that during discussion. These reforms have been introduced by their government, the federal Labour government. I will have more to say about that in a moment.

We did go through a process in March 2022, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, of which I was Chair for many years during my time in the Senate. A very well founded and usually a very sensible committee.

In relation to the new tribunal, the Australian Government indicated that the new administrative review arrangements would have a number of benefits and that is set out in federal parliament.
There was a question about consultation on the bill. It is a minor technical bill with consequential changes to it. This is normal practice in terms of full public consultation, but of course, we are always happy to get feedback through myself directly or through the office or directly through the department.

The bill, as I have indicated, reflects changes to the federal law that have already occurred. In essence, the bill simply ensures that the name of the Commonwealth body is correct in Tasmanian law. In that respect, consultation was not necessary.

I have indicated what the bill will do and what would happen if we did not change the name. It would still apply, but it would be cumbersome and there would clearly need to be further efforts made to make sure that it is in line with Tasmanian legislation. It could cause confusion for people reading the legislation as the name of the federal tribunal would be incorrect, and as Attorney-General, certainly from my point of view, I pride myself and on behalf of the government in ensuring that our Tasmanian law is as clear and accessible as possible.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=8.2_D=25.4_C=0.77] There is a range of comments and criticisms with respect to a number of members of the former Administrative Appeal Tribunal and I would like to address that very shortly. The AAT and now the Review Tribunal has important work with respect to tax, refugees, disability and NDIS related matters.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=34.4_D=4.9_C=0.72] I think, in my understanding last checking was some 40,000 cases per annum. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=40.3_D=29.9_C=0.86]  There was at least for a while a backlog of some 67,000 cases and it does have important work to undertake. The allegation of political appointments, of course, there have also been allegations that some of those that have been appointed are political appointees. Now it should be based on merit. There should be an independent process in terms [Bookmark: Phr5_O=70.3_D=30.0_C=0.85]  of the appointment of those particular people, but I do know many of those who were members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal did excellent work - they are good people who did excellent, productive, professional work and work that was absolutely admired and appreciated by all those concerned. I would not want the comments and criticism shared today to besmirch the reputations [Bookmark: Phr6_O=100.9_D=26.5_C=0.78]  of some of those people. I would like to call out the Leader of the Greens for unfair and unfounded allegations with respect to her criticisms of Matthew Groom. 

Dr Woodruff - I did not make a criticism of him. I just said that he was appointed to it.

Mr BARNETT - You named Matthew Groom.

Dr Woodruff - Yes.

Mr BARNETT - You were criticising the process and in my view demeaning the reputation of certain people and you named Matthew Groom. I stand up for Matthew Groom.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=128.8_D=9.5_C=0.77] Dr Woodruff - I was criticising the process where people were appointed, not his reputation.

Mr BARNETT - I stand up for Matthew Groom. He is a lawyer. He has done a law degree. He has a Masters of Law and a Bachelor of Arts. He is competent, capable, and professional.  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=138.9_D=5.5_C=0.65] From all reports I have, he has done an excellent job in that role  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=146.0_D=4.1_C=0.68] as a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.
Whether you consider [Bookmark: Phr10_O=150.9_D=20.4_C=0.87]  the actions of the federal Labor government to be vindictive and politically motivated, I will leave that to you. There is no doubt in my mind that he has performed an excellent role. He was a minister in this place, for Parks, the Environment, for Energy. He was acting attorney-general for some time. I count him as a colleague and a friend. I am not acting in this case in a biased way, I am acting in a way that commends him  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=180.7_D=13.7_C=0.81] for what he has done and what he has served and I will not stand in this place as an Attorney-General, Minister for Justice, as part of this government to allow the unfair besmirching of reputations. I say that very strongly  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=196.2_D=5.3_C=0.75] and I want to make it really clear that that is not on.

With federal Labor, you have made a whole range of points that simply suggest that  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=203.6_D=6.6_C=0.83]  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=210.8_D=14.6_C=0.76] they are clean and green and doing exactly the right job. That has not been the case. We have just had President Trump's tariffs impacting Tasmania and Australia. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=227.1_D=17.2_C=0.80]  Why is it that Prime Minister Albanese has not picked up the phone? 

Dr Woodruff - Oh, for goodness sake. What has this got to do with stacking the AAT?

Mr BARNETT - I simply ask the question. You have laid lots of criticisms and blame at the feet of all these supposed political appointees, but  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=244.8_D=28.7_C=0.83] federal Labor has to answer that question and that is greatly disappointing in terms of the breaching of the agreements and contracts for a whole range of ambassadors all around the world that were cut short because when they came to power, they wanted to impose their Labor ideology across Australia and the globe, and unfairly and disappointingly, has impacted the relationship between our country and certain other countries.  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=273.6_D=29.9_C=0.75] I know that for a fact because I know some of those various ambassadors who have been appointed and were cut short. 

Dr Woodruff - Are you blaming what Donald Trump is doing on the Labor Party? That is the longest bow I have ever heard.

Members interjecting.

Mr BARNETT - They were doing an excellent job representing Australia.

Ms Haddad - Everything might not be perfect in the Labor Party, but I do not know if we can be held responsible for Donald Trump.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order, members on my left.

Mr BARNETT - They were doing an excellent job representing our country and I do not want their reputations besmirched by federal Labor and in terms of the comments this afternoon with respect to  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=303.7_D=1.2_C=0.16] Matthew Groom.  They are entirely rejected. I will not have a bar of it.

Having said that, the bill is an excellent bill. It is a technical bill. This is just what we need to do in Tasmania to achieve best practice. That is what we are on about here, as a government. It is good to have the support across the Chamber for the bill.

Second Reading.

[3.28 p.m.]
Mr JAENSCH (Braddon - Minister for Community Services) -  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=147.5_D=4.2_C=0.90] Deputy Speaker, I move -

That the bill be now read a second time.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=152.8_D=25.5_C=0.90] The Tasmanian Community Fund (TCF) was established to operate independently of government. Since 2000, it has awarded more than $137 million in grants to more than 3230 projects. The Tasmanian government is responsible for ensuring the appropriate governance and accountability of the Tasmanian Community Fund and its processes.  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=179.2_D=6.0_C=0.84] To this end, we are proposing targeted amendments that will provide enhanced transparency  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=185.4_D=26.8_C=0.88] and community confidence in the governance and decision-making structures and processes of the Tasmanian Community Fund. The amendments address several issues and concerns identified in the Auditor-General's August 2024 report, Tasmanian Community Fund Referendum Support and Assessment of Grant Funding to Australians for Indigenous Constitutional Recognition Ltd.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=213.6_D=2.2_C=0.83] The Auditor-General's recommendations  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=215.8_D=17.5_C=0.83] were that the TCF:
1.	Conducts and documents due diligence including recording the legislative basis, key considerations, conflicts of interest, assessment of risks, and any advice relied upon in reaching its decisions.

2.	Adopts better practice grants management to objectively assess the relative merit of grants with clear reasons why applications are approved or denied.

3.	Provides regular guidance, training, and clear directions to staff to ensure they are able to comply with Tasmanian State Service principles of remaining impartial and apolitical while following the Board's directions.

4.	Adopts better practice records management in accordance with the Archives Act and associated guidance.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=281.3_D=12.1_C=0.85] I appreciate the time taken by members and their advisers who have participated in briefings regarding this bill. I appreciated the opportunity to address the questions that were raised.  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=294.8_D=10.2_C=0.89] The amendment bill provides explicit direction that the TCF board must not directly make grants for political purposes and must act in a professional and impartial manner in performing its functions and exercising its powers more generally.
As advised in drafting the bill, the amendments do not define 'political', as it was not deemed appropriate to attempt to provide an exhaustive definition of all matters that may be considered political. The TCF board will be supported through the Department of Premier and Cabinet to obtain advice, if required, to inform its decision-making on matters such as what may constitute a political campaign or political decision.

The amendment clarifies that the TCF Board must comply with the requirements of the Archives Act 1983 and Audit Act 2008 and that grants provided by the board are considered grant expenditure for the purposes of the Public Accounts Committee Act 1970 to make it clear that decisions on such grounds may be scrutinised by the Public Accounts Committee.

The amendment bill provides a requirement for the TCF board to develop, publish and comply with a grant management framework based on contemporary best practice and aligning with relevant treasurers' instructions as though the board were an agency under the Financial Management Act 2016. It also requires the TCF board to conduct independent external performance audits of its compliance with grant management frameworks every four years and release the key recommendations publicly.

The amendment bill requires the TCF to publicly consult on the development of its draft strategic plan for a minimum period of 21 days prior to its finalisation and adoption, and to prepare and publish an annual report against a strategic plan. These amendments will help strengthen the important role the TCF board plays in the Tasmanian community. The amendments strengthen accountability and build an important framework for the expenditure of public funds by the TCF board, while ensuring they remain apolitical, independent and transparent.

As these amendments are mainly administrative in nature and do not affect the ability of the Tasmanian Community Fund to deliver community grants, targeted consultation was undertaken focusing on community sector peaks and the TCF board. I have listened to the feedback provided and have ensured the consideration of this feedback throughout the drafting process.

The proposed amendments do not seek to limit the independence of the TCF board. They are intended to explicitly articulate the parliament's expectations in relation to the prudent and appropriate management of public funds the Tasmanian Community Fund administers on behalf of the Tasmanian community. The amendments bring the TCF board's accountability and governance obligations into line with those of other statutory boards with similar responsibilities for public funds.

The TCF board has advised me that it is progressing well in implementing recommendations made in the Auditor-General's August 2024 report. The Tasmanian Community Fund has a 25-year history of supporting the Tasmanian community. The TCF board recently held its first meeting with its three new members, including the new chair, Kym Goodes. The board has shared with me that it is seeking to understand community views on the TCF and its purpose for the future.

The government looks forward to understanding those views and what needs to be considered to support the TCF to fulfil its purpose as the community intends. That will be a longer-term consideration. It is important to proceed with this amendment bill now to give Tasmanians confidence that we have acted on the Auditor-General's recommendations and support the continued work and independence of the Tasmanian Community Fund.

Deputy Speaker, I commend the bill to the House.

[3.35 p.m.]
Ms BROWN (Franklin) - Deputy Speaker, I rise today to speak on my second ever bill to this place, the Tasmanian Community Fund Amendment Bill 2024. This is legislation that directly effects one of Tasmania's most valuable funding bodies. The TCF was established to operate independently of government, ensuring that grants are allocated based on community need. Since its inception, the TCF has supported more than 3230 projects, strengthening our communities, empowering grassroots organisations and improving the lives of Tasmanians.

I want to take a moment and acknowledge and thank the independent board for their dedication and commitment to this important work. From the outset, I want to say that Labor will not be supporting this bill. While I acknowledge the government's intent, I have concerns with elements of this legislation, and these elements could undermine the independence and effectiveness of the TCF.

After reviewing the bill and related documents, I have concerns about certain aspects of it which could potentially undermine the very values that we seek to preserve. This bill introduces a potential overreach and a risk of political interference, all of which contradict the very purpose of the fund. One of my primary concerns lies with clause 5, which amends section 7 of the act regarding two functions of the board, with a new wording that states:

(2A)	For the purposes of subsection (1)(a), grants may not be made by the Board - 

to directly support, or object to, a political position or political campaign; or

for any other political purpose.

While I understand the intent behind this provision, its vague and overly broad wording creates unintended consequences.

It risks preventing the TCF from funding projects outside areas where political parties, governments, or opposition have made commitments. Take, for example, Neighbourhood Houses, of which I am a big supporter. Political parties from across the spectrum acknowledge their value and governments, or oppositions have made commitments of support for Neighbourhood Houses in the past, and this clause would prevent the TCF from funding them.

The lack of clarity could unnecessarily limit the TCF's ability to deliver projects to community organisations that desperately need them. 

Without a clear definition of political purpose, this cause introduces uncertainty and could defer worthy organisations from applying for the fund, fearing their projects may be deemed political. This is a serious flaw that risks stifling the TCF's impact.

It could also restrict the TCF's ability to work in partnership with the government, which it has done in the past. Without a proper definition of what constitutes political purpose, the clause alone could undermine the functionality of the TCF and limit its ability to effectively serve the community.

Another concern I have is the inclusion of Section 7A(d), which states:

(d)	is to include such matters as prescribed.

This provision grants the government power to change aspects of the fund's operation through regulation rather than legislation. The danger here is pretty clear.

Mr Jaensch - The act already provides for the making of regulations.

Ms BROWN - Did you not say to me that it creates opportunity for regulation rather than legislation?

Mr Jaensch - No, the act already makes provision for the making of regulations. What this is doing is making sure that that is recognised in the new section that is being inserted into the act so that within the grants framework it observes anything that is in the act and in regulation.

Ms BROWN - The decision about the fund's scope eligibility or the fund's priorities could be made behind closed doors without proper parliamentary scrutiny. The TCF's independence is fundamental to the credibility and success. By allowing such changes to be made through regulation, the bill opens the door to political influence and threatens transparency and accountability that has been the hallmarks of the fund since its inception.

I do acknowledge that there are some elements of the bill, such as updates to the administrative and reporting requirements, that are very sensible improvements that will enhance transparency and accountability. These changes ensure that the fund continues to operate effectively and with public confidence. However, there are serious flaws that I have outlined in this bill and they are the reason why we cannot support it.

Tasmanians deserve legislation that does not  threaten the integrity of the fund that is designed to serve them. For those reasons, Labor will be opposing the bill.

[3.42 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak on the Tasmanian Community Fund Amendment Bill 2024. I thank the minister and the staff for the briefings that we have had, noting that we had two briefings, one with the minister in attendance. Obviously, this is considered a pretty special bill. Maybe I will come back to that again later.

I want to begin by speaking about the Greens perspective more broadly on the wonderful Tasmanian Community Fund and the incredible work that the fund does to provide grants to not-for-profit organisations and for projects that benefit the Tasmanian community. The Tasmanian Community Fund is an incredibly important institution in our state. It enables many organisations to do much-needed community building work in many communities around Tasmania and it is much loved for that reason.

It was established in 1999 with proceeds from the sale of the Trust Bank and it was set up to ensure that there was community benefit that flowed from the sale of the Trust Bank to the people of Tasmania and that that benefit was maintained for the long-term. I had the pleasure of being part of a project that received a grant from the Tasmanian Community Fund back in 2010, when I was working in a Neighbourhood House in the northern suburbs of Launceston.

There were two Neighbourhood Houses working together providing a literacy project and we were successful in putting in an application for that, and that was really important work because we know that literacy rates within Tasmania are low, and that we have quite a low level of functional literacy. That is a critical work and an important project that the Tasmanian Community Fund was able to support and make happen with the grant that they provided.

One of the things about the Tasmanian Community Fund is the importance of independence within it. The fund was set up to be separate from government, to be at arm's length, to not have the government involved in the decisions that were being made about the funding decisions that were being made and independence is a key tenet of the TCF.

There have been threats along the way already to the independence of the Tasmanian Community Fund. This is not the first time that the government has tried to step in and undermine the independence of the Tasmanian Community Fund. One of the commitments made in the inaugural budget of the Hodgman Liberal government in 2014 was to abolish the independent TCF board and establish an unpaid independent panel with the intention to reallocate funds for the board to 'government to programs' so the funds could be reallocated to be used by the government for their programs. Completely flies in the face of the independence of the TCF and it goes to show there has been a long history of the government wanting to have a say in the way the TCF uses their money. The independence of the TCF is paramount. The government already has every cent of public money at their disposal to spend however they want. There is no justification for the government to have any involvement at all in the expenditure of TCF funds.  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.3_D=24.9_C=0.91] However, that is exactly what the minister has indicated in his second reading speech:

The TCF board will be supported through the Department of Premier and Cabinet to obtain advice, if required, to inform its decision-making on matters such as what may constitute a political campaign or a political decision.

The Department of Premier and Cabinet (DPAC) will therefore be the arbiter of what is or is not a political purpose.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=55.0_D=6.0_C=0.89] There is no detail on how this advice will be provided or which office of the department will be responsible.  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=61.4_D=28.1_C=0.87] There is no detail on how the TCF board may appeal or disagree with the advice provided by DPAC. It is completely unacceptable for a department of this government or any government to be the decision-maker on what is or is not a political purpose. We are far too involved and wrapped up in it ourselves as political parties to be able to make that decision. This amendment will unquestionably  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=90.3_D=7.0_C=0.82] impede the independence of the TCF. It will do exactly what the minister claims this bill seeks to avoid.  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=97.7_D=4.1_C=0.76] It will politicise TCF funding decisions. 
 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=102.7_D=15.2_C=0.91] 
It is not difficult to imagine what may happen when a community group submits a grant application for a cause the government of the day does not support. All that would need to happen is for it to be stamped as a political purpose by the department and it would be dead in the water.  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=118.3_D=29.7_C=0.85] That would have a chilling effect on community organisations. They will be discouraged from even submitting an application to the TCF if there is even the slightest chance that their organisation or their project could be deemed political: LGBTQIA+ community organisations, multicultural groups, women's groups, Aboriginal cultural organisations, and youth justice organisations. All of these are important community groups which provide essential services and programs  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=148.2_D=10.0_C=0.82] across the state. They may be discouraged from applying for TCF funding because of the risk that what they do might be seen as for a political purpose.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=160.1_D=10.5_C=0.93] There is quite a bit of history to how we got here with this piece of legislation before us today. The history starts back with the referendum debate -  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=172.2_D=18.2_C=0.83] with a referendum. It was not a debate at that time. Initially the referendum was supported by both political parties at a federal level. Then the situation changed and all of a sudden the Liberals decided at a federal level that they no longer supported the yes vote for a referendum, and that they did not want to see the Voice getting up.  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=191.2_D=29.2_C=0.83] As the member for Clark has just said, it is a shame. At the time what was happening in Tasmania was that every political party was in support of the referendum and of the Voice for ensuring that Aboriginals in Australia would have a greater say and would have a pathway to improvements in the conditions that they live with, and in closing the gap.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=223.1_D=25.6_C=0.87] In that context, the TCF made a decision to provide funding to an organisation that was involved in education. We know that the TCF deemed that the application from Reconciliation Tasmania, or the project with Reconciliation Tasmania, was  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=251.7_D=2.8_C=0.91] part of an education process that they had [Bookmark: Phr15_O=254.9_D=7.4_C=0.84] . For educational purposes they audited it under that banner.  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=263.6_D=26.5_C=0.87] They also had a long history of providing support for grants that assist Tasmanian Aboriginal communities. We had three political parties who all agreed and supported the referendum. We had an educational procedure and educational process in place within TCF. We had a long history of TCF providing grants to Aboriginal communities. They made that grant.

 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=290.9_D=5.4_C=0.84] I think we all know the history of what happened with the referendum, that terrible history. The referendum  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=297.0_D=8.0_C=0.85] did not get up and the Voice did not happen. Then it was after that that some people - one person - I have tried to find out how many community members had an issue with that grant and I have not been able to find that information. Yesterday when I asked the minister, he said 'a number'. One is a number.

Ms Haddad - Jonno Duniam.

Ms ROSOL - We know that Senator Jonno Duniam referred this to the Auditor-General. We do not know if anyone else  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.4_D=4.7_C=0.82] had had any issues with this grant. We have not been provided with that information.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.0_D=24.2_C=0.84] To have this amendment in front of us and supposedly saying that this maintains the independence of the TCF, and we will not have political processes and political things as part of this, this will be protected against - this whole amendment is politically motivated. The history is there from what happened with the referendum: from the grant being provided  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=56.0_D=5.0_C=0.87] as part of the Yes campaign for the referendum, through to the complaint from a Liberal  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=61.4_D=16.5_C=0.85] senator who did not support the referendum, through to the Auditor-General investigating and making a report through to this piece of legislation.

I might note that the Auditor-General did not recommend legislation. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=79.8_D=3.4_C=0.78]  I have here the recommendations that the Auditor-General made that the TCF:

1.	Conducts and documents due diligence including recording the legislative basis, key considerations, conflicts of interest, assessment of risks, and any advice relied upon in reaching its decisions.

2.	Adopts better practice grants management to objectively assess the relative merit of grants with clear reasons why applications are approved or denied.

3.	Provides regular guidance, training, and clear directions to staff to ensure they are able to comply with Tasmanian State Service principles of remaining impartial and apolitical while following the Board's directions.

4.	Adopts better practice records management in accordance with the Archives Act and associated guidance.

I cannot anywhere in there see a recommendation for the legislation that we have in front of us today.  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=139.6_D=5.9_C=0.77] Nowhere in those recommendations does it say that the TCF should be banned from supporting political purposes. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=146.7_D=28.4_C=0.88]  In fact, it is evident from reading the Auditor-General's report that the recommendations are designed to be adopted internally by the TCF board. These are processes that a board can conduct themselves without needing a piece of legislation to be enacted to do them.

I spoke today with the chair of the TCF board. I was advised by them that actually the TCF have implemented  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=175.5_D=25.3_C=0.90] nearly all of these recommendations. There is one that they are still working on at the moment. If the government wants to stand here and claim that this piece of legislation is because of the Auditor-General's recommendations, that does not actually stand up. It does not stand up from the recommendations. It does not stand up because the TCF have already done the work or almost completed the work of implementing the recommendations.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=201.8_D=7.1_C=0.77] I note that the government has an overwhelming number of recommendations from various inquiries for legislative changes that they are yet to make.  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=209.6_D=29.6_C=0.87] We are often standing in here hearing about recommendations that have not been implemented: up into the hundreds. There are outstanding recommendations from the commission of inquiry, from the Weiss Independent Review, and from the Cox Review, to name a few. The government has not made a convincing case as to why these recommendations need to be enshrined into law. They have not made a case for why they have gone above and beyond the recommendations from the report  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=239.8_D=6.6_C=0.81] with the obligations they intend to foist on the TCF in this bill.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=250.7_D=2.2_C=0.81]  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=256.6_D=22.4_C=0.87] The minister has stated that the amendments bring the TCF board's accountability and governance obligations into line with those of other statutory boards with similar responsibilities for public funds. I ask the minister to advise which other statutory boards are required to release a draft of their strategic plan for a 21-day public comment period. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=280.4_D=7.8_C=0.88]  I would also like the minister to indicate where the Auditor-General has recommended that the TCF release their strategic plan for public comment. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=289.4_D=15.6_C=0.91]  I would also like advice as to which other statutory boards are required to audit their grant management frameworks or similar every four years, and provide a copy to the minister with a written statement of the steps taken, if any, by the board in response to the audit and where the Auditor-General made this recommendation in their report.

The government has grossly overreached into the functions of the independent Tasmanian Community Fund through this bill and there is no justification for it. Since the minister has not sufficiently justified the need for these overreaching provisions, there is only one explanation as to why this bill has been brought, and everyone in the community sector knows why that is. This bill is nothing but a punishment to the TCF for supporting the Voice referendum.

In his second reading speech and in briefings yesterday, the minister indicated that the new TCF board intends to engage in some sort of consultation process to:

Understand community views on the TCF and its purpose.

and that it is necessary to bring on this amendment bill to:

Give Tasmanians confidence that we have acted on the Auditor-General's recommendations and support the continued work and independence of the Tasmanian Community Fund.

This is circuitous logic to us. What if the community consultation says that they think the purpose of the TCF is to support political purposes and campaigns? How will that consultation process interact with this bill?

It seems to be a waste of the parliament's time to bring this bill on now if some sort of review process will be entered into in the near future. I also understand that the TCF are interested in the whole act being reviewed rather than just having one selective part of this act being reviewed and amended.

This is a really targeted amendment for reasons of political motivation. The Greens, you have probably gathered from what I have said, do not support this piece of legislation and will not be voting for it. I am really disappointed that it has been brought before the parliament today.

I am also disappointed, I understand, that the TCF board have been in place for six weeks and in that time have not yet had time to meet and fully get their heads around this legislation as a new board. I understand there was a position of the previous board, but now we have a new board. It is unfortunate that we have this bill up for debate today when a key stakeholder, the stakeholder who is affected by this legislation, has not yet had time to form a position and make a submission and feedback around this piece of legislation.

We do not support it. We cannot support it. 

[3.59 p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to speak on the Tasmanian Community Fund Amendment Bill 2024.

The Tasmanian Community Fund is a really important Tasmanian institution, in terms of the funds that it has allocated to community groups and, and organisations and communities across our state for 25 years.

There are a number of us in this House who can remember the creation of it. I remember in the late 1990s hearing about the debate and the sale of the Tasmanian Trust Bank. As a kid, putting my money into the Launceston Bank for Savings, I turned up to school and they gave you -

Mr Abetz - That was the Hobart Savings Bank.

Mr O'BYRNE - the amalgamation between those two institutions created the Tasmanian Trust Bank. I remember very clearly the debate at the time. Jim Bacon was leading the Labor Party in 1999, and I think at that stage the opposition leader was - Tony Rundle had left. I am not sure who the opposition was at that stage. My memory fails me.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Sue Napier.

Mr O'BYRNE - Sue Napier at the time. Will Hodgman did not come until 2002, and then 2006 election. I remember the debate very clearly and it was one of those moments where there was agreement across the aisles in terms of the importance of the sale but more importantly the importance of the fund, and that it would play a role in our community free of political intervention from this place, from governments, from parties and political influence. It was an asset of the Tasmanian people, for the Tasmanian people, and chairs over a number of years and boards over a number of years have worked diligently to provide community groups with opportunities to seek funding for infrastructure for a whole range of good deeds that have made our community better. 

Whilst there has been some recent controversy, and I will address some of those matters in a moment, it is overwhelmingly a good thing. It has played a positive role in the Tasmanian community. I remember the debates, because there was a view and there was a fear from the community that governments would reach in, that cabinets or ministers or parliaments would influence the expenditure, would influence and direct the expenditure in a political way.

With regard to the establishment, we should never forget where this started and the intent of all sides of the House to ensure an independent, robust committee was established to allocate those funds that could make Tasmania a better place, and overwhelmingly, rarely has it done anything but. It is essentially there to strengthen the Tasmanian community.

The board, for example, granted over $1.5 million for the Scout and Girl Guide groups around Tasmania, a really valuable investment. It has assisted Rotary Clubs, Rotorac, Lions, Lioness, Probus, Apex Clubs, projects such as upgrading of public recreation facilities, environmental projects and community transport; over $880,000 to the National Trust to preserve Tasmania's historic buildings and history; over two and a half million to skate parks, bike tracks, walking tracks around the state; $1.7 million to organisations supporting victims of sexual assault or violence. You look at the TCF's website and there is example after example of where they have done good deeds for Tasmania. That in essence should never ever be forgotten or lost in what has become an unfortunate, I think, political debate.

Looking at the Auditor-General's report in response to a public issue, it is clear that the board, and talking to the new chair of the board and the new members of the board collectively, they are working together to ensure that the Auditor-General's report is respected. As we know, from time to time, all organisations, the longer you have been around at times you are constantly looking outward with regard to 'we have got a job to do, let us get the money out, let us support communities' and sometimes processes need to be reviewed and in talking to the new chair and talking to the previous chair, they in good conscience have worked hard to do to do their work in a forthright, but also thoughtful, manner.

Whilst the issue of politics and the grant that has been alluded to by the previous speaker regarding the grant around the recent referendum, regardless of what we think of the politics, it is always a political moment in Australian history. 

In some respects I do not question the good intent of the nature of the grant that has caused the controversy, but it is clear that it has raised a question around the role, and it is appropriate for us to review it and it is appropriate for the board to undertake an assessment of where they are as an organisation. 

In talking to the board I am really heartened by Ms Goodes' view that they will undertake a significant public consultation and conversation around the ongoing role of the TCF, understanding the organisations history, understanding the unique and special place that it plays regarding its support for communities, the length and breadth of our state, and to me, that is completely appropriate for an organisation that has been around for 25 years.

It is not a reflection on what has been going on before, it is not a judgment on the work that they do today, but it is an appropriate thing to do. From the Auditor General's report, there are a number of process issues that I think we all agree on about some of the reporting, particularly with the Archives Act 1983, and understanding a level of transparency for reasons for decisions and how things are made. I think that is completely appropriate. I have flagged this with the minister and I act here in goodwill. I am concerned about some elements of [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=8.2_C=0.74]  the bill which may impinge on the independence of the board and also  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=39.5_D=7.9_C=0.84] the nature of a section of the amendment bill which refers to the issue of 'politics'. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=49.2_D=19.8_C=0.75]  That is a really hard thing to define. I have been around a lot of community organisations and there are politics everywhere, particularly in my role as State Football League (SFL) president, and with football clubs around the state. There are politics everywhere. One person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter. It is all about political perspective and view. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=69.7_D=25.8_C=0.78] 

I think there are legitimate concerns. I know the board have a good intent to modernise their practices and to ensure that they act in an ethical way. I am not reflecting and I am not saying anyone else has acted unethically here. The board is very conscious of trying to ensure  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=96.4_D=8.8_C=0.70] that their practices are contemporary and that there is a level of transparency around the decision-making. They are absolutely intent  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=105.7_D=9.4_C=0.88] on having a community conversation around the role of the TCF. I understand that  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=116.8_D=18.5_C=0.83] there have been some concerns raised in corners of the community. In my head that would mean the process stuff around reporting and auditing that the TCF board have already implemented and are finalising implementation of those recommendations. 

Would it not make sense  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=136.4_D=27.2_C=0.84] to allow the TCF board to conduct that conversation with the Tasmanian community? There may very well be ideas and suggestions that will need legislative change. Would it not make sense, with a new board and a new chair, to allow that process to continue and allow that conversation to be had? Therefore, any legislative change that may or may not be required  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=164.4_D=1.7_C=0.79] will have the complete support  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=166.9_D=21.0_C=0.82] of the people we have tasked with delivering the job of allocating the funds under the TCF board.

Let us not forget the origins. If people are concerned about independence and the definition of politics, which is enormously hard to define [Bookmark: Phr12_O=189.8_D=5.3_C=0.65] : capital 'P', small 'p'; there is politics everywhere. It is in the eye of the beholder. I have made that point.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=197.2_D=22.1_C=0.79] The origins of this fund - I remember the debates very clearly. I remember listening to a radio interview of the then premier, Jim Bacon, in 1999. I was driving down Murray Street towards parliament. I was obviously not coming here. That was a few years later. I was driving past the Trust Bank building and listening to  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=221.0_D=4.9_C=0.49] an interview with Jim Bacon, then I think it was Loughran. Was Loughran the original chair?  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=226.6_D=29.2_C=0.72] I think I have that here somewhere. I think it was Gerald Loughran. I remember the care that they had because everyone thought, 'Oh, the government is going to raid the money here and we are never going to see it'. There was really clear intent from all sides of politics and particularly the chair, Gerald Loughran, that this was the Tasmanian Community Fund and the fund was there to make Tasmania a stronger and better place, and to strengthen communities.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=255.9_D=30.0_C=0.79] I have given example after example of where they have done that. They have done that in spades. I know, as every local member would hear, they would receive requests for help from bowls clubs, sporting clubs, community clubs. I have given the examples of Apex and Rotary and about, 'Look, we just want to fix up this barbecue. We think it is a great little community area. Where do we go?' Well, you know, you push them off to the  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=286.1_D=18.9_C=0.70] Tasmanian Community Fund with a bit of help and a bit of support, and you find other ways to try and support them in accessing the money. It is not just hard infrastructure like that building communities. There is a whole range of really good, worthy community groups that have benefited from the Tasmanian Community Fund.

If you have people in that role charged with  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=8.8_D=10.8_C=0.75] allocating that money, ensuring the fund is well-managed, and ensuring that transfer, if they are saying, 'We want to have a community conversation' - I understand the minister's intent.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=21.6_D=10.2_C=0.82] He has made it very clear to me that he believes from the Auditor-General's report that he needs to act in good faith with that and that this legislation is necessary. It very may well be [Bookmark: Phr4_O=32.8_D=24.3_C=0.81] , but I think there are concerns in the community around that fundamental principle of independence from the bureaucracy, and also from the government and parliament itself. There are concerns that it does act independently and makes its own decisions within a range or scope. I do not second-guess the minister's motives.

What I do believe  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=57.9_D=5.2_C=0.91] would be appropriate is that we give that process with the  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=63.9_D=28.4_C=0.74] new TCF board and the new chair, that opportunity to have that conversation with the Tasmanian community about how the TCF works. It is the Tasmanian community's money. It is their funds. It is their organisations. In an overwhelming 99.9 per cent of the decisions - there is an argument to say 100 per cent, but I am not going to get into the politics of that - they have done the right thing.  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=93.1_D=1.8_C=0.80] They have distributed the money [Bookmark: Phr8_O=95.3_D=12.2_C=0.80] . We are a stronger community because of their work. Whilst there has been a controversy, let us not forget they have done a hell of a good job. If they are saying to us [Bookmark: Phr9_O=108.4_D=28.4_C=0.87]  that independent of government they want to do this review and engage with the community, and from that there may be some recommendations around either regulations or legislation, then I think it is the appropriate time to act.

There is no question of trust in my mind of the chair in Kym Goodes, the quality of person that she is and the manner in which she has conducted herself in many public roles.  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=137.7_D=1.8_C=0.62] If it is a question of faith [Bookmark: Phr11_O=140.6_D=12.7_C=0.79] , I supported the previous chair and the previous board as in previous chairs independent of government. If there is a question mark, I think it is no longer there. The government have effectively appointed the new board.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=154.1_D=4.0_C=0.82] I do not second guess, and I am saying the minister has ulterior motives. You can read from the second reading speech. I want to thank the minister for his staff's very generous time briefing my office. I really appreciate that. In having this debate and this discussion [Bookmark: Phr14_O=177.4_D=10.7_C=0.80] , the motives to try and make sure that this is the best fund, I think you are there. I think if there is a legitimate question about some of the legislative amendments that you are proposing, even from the new board itself, then it would be a sensible and reasonable approach to allow the board to do that work. It would be unfortunate if there would be a debate in this House where a vote is called. At the minute, based on the concerns that I have reading the amendment bill and seeking advice and support  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=189.2_D=8.2_C=0.93] to inform my decision from key people, I believe I would be in no other position but to vote against the amendment bill.

It is not because I want to have a fight with the government. It is not because I disagree with the minister's intent. I believe two things. First, there is an element of the bill which I think questions the independence. I think that is a problem. Second, I have faith and trust in the chair and the new board to, for the first time I am aware of in 25 years, since the establishment of the fund back in 1999 with the enabling act, that the Tasmanian people and community organisations that have benefited will have an opportunity to have their say.

You hear feedback saying, 'The process was a bit clunky', or, 'I thought it was this and I got confused'. It is a great opportunity for the government to support a conversation with the TCF, the board, and the work that they do to ensure that we reinvigorate the Tasmanian Community Fund and re-establish [Bookmark: Phr20_O=291.1_D=2.3_C=0.77]  it in the eyes of the Tasmanian community,  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=295.3_D=9.6_C=0.70] consistent with the principles of the establishment. The sale of the People's Bank, the Old Hobart Bank for Savings and the Launceston Bank for sale - I wish I had kept that little bank. I think it was grade 3 in East Launceston Primary School. You would put your one cent and two cent pieces in and you would go, 'Nearly at the bank, and you would get there - so it is a big part of Tassie's history. 

The connection and the kind of banking institutions that we had back there in the late 1970s and the 1980s, et cetera. When we sold our bank it did not mean that we just gave it away and the money was thrown around. We established an organisation to do good deeds to strengthen the Tasmanian community, and it has overwhelmingly done that. No one can argue that. If we have a new chair, a new board, if we have a community conversation that is willing to be had, why do we not have that?

Then when a minister brings to this House a package of legislative reform, it will do so in the knowledge that it has been driven by the Tasmanian community, for the Tasmanian community, and we will be acting on their wills with good conscience and the best of intentions. It is hard to argue, even if you do want to play politics in this place, although we are trying to take politics out of it. Even if you do want to play politics, it is hard to argue. We have gone through a consultation process. We have gone through all of this sort of stuff. This is actually the will of the people. Then the minister may very well have a much better time in getting this through.

Again, I will make it very clear, I am not questioning the motives of the minister. I believe he is acting in good conscience to try and improve the TCF. I think, this House, if we can find time to work through that process with the minister, we may help him in doing that.
In summary, I thank all those Tasmanians who worked on the board of the Tasmanian Community Fund over 25 years. Your work has not been ignored, and has not been degraded by this debate. In fact, I think it has been lifted. It is an acknowledgement of the work that you have done: the chairs and all the board members over the last 25 years. We particularly wish the current board and new Chair all the very best in the work that you do because you play a very important role. This parliament values you, and the Tasmanian community values you. I believe if we can come together in a compromise to have that public consultation, we will have a better, stronger act that, consistent with the debate back in 1999 with Premier Bacon and Opposition Leader Sue Napier, we all come together and agree on the settings that we have applied. 

[4.19 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to make my contribution on the Tasmanian Community Fund Amendment Bill. I want to begin, as others have done, in recognising the amazing work Tasmania Community Fund has done over many years. I have been lucky in previous lives in volunteer capacities in various community groups to have written a number of successful TCF grant applications. I acknowledge the work that they do in empowering communities to respond to needs that they have identified within their local communities, but also capacity building and the amazing education work that they do in building capacity around community organisations. It is a really important role they play. I want to pay tribute to all the work that they have done and my appreciation for it all.

I want to indicate at the outset my opposition to this bill. I support the sentiments, particularly those expressed by the Greens member for Bass in her contribution, because it was very detailed in terms of the history of how we have got to the point of this bill being tabled and debated today, and I recognise that.

We had a briefing, late last year - it might have been October or November last year. I attended it with a number of other crossbench opposition members. It seemed to me at that point in time it was expressed to the officers who gave that briefing that there was a deep concern with the structure of this bill and the intent behind this bill. I had hoped that following that briefing, given that it was almost a universal concern about the reasons for the bill coming on and for the influence on the independence of the TCF, that we had seen the end of the bill.

It came as some surprise to me that another briefing was offered yesterday and I could not attend, unfortunately. My adviser attended on my behalf. In fact, this bill has been brought on to debate at this very early stage. It is my dismay they had not read perhaps the writing on the wall last October or November.

It is deeply disrespectful to bring this on now and recognising that the new board has only been in place for a short six weeks. I pay tribute to previous boards, as Mr O'Byrne has done, but recognising that this new board in particular has only been in place for a very short period of time and has not had an opportunity to properly respond to the issues arising out of the bill or to the issues generally around Tasmania Community Fund governance. It is deeply disrespectful to be forcing this debate so early on.

It seems to me that the previous boards have taken on board the concerns expressed by the Auditor-General and the recommendations and, as we have already heard, have largely implemented the recommendations and there is only one still outstanding which is being currently worked on. 
The issues identified in the Auditor-General's report are largely dealt with. There is no need for legislative change. Indeed, it was not a recommendation of the Auditor-General to make legislative changes. I am not quite sure what the problem is that we are trying to address with this bill. It can only lead me to one conclusion, and it was a question that we asked in the briefing we received last year: what was the reason for this?

It seemed to me that there was a complaint about a particular grant that had been received, and I note that, when I asked how many complaints have been received, that answer was not provided in the briefing. Ms Rosol also said that it was not provided to her. One is a number, and we are aware that complaint came from Senator Duniam in relation to the grant issued in relation to education about the Voice referendum.

It is one complaint that we can identify out of the thousands upon thousands of grants that they have issued over decades. It seems to me that we are taking a sledgehammer to this issue completely unnecessarily and we are jeopardising the independence of this important body. It is deeply disturbing. I can only be led to conclude that this is political retribution for what one particular person did not like the TCF providing a grant to.

I do not want to be part of that particular retribution. I want to support the TCF in their governance frameworks and the work that they are doing, and I want to applaud them for the work they have done in response to the Auditor-General's report, but I do not want to jeopardise their independence and that is exactly what this bill would do. It would insert the politics into TCF when I think they have done a fine job for the many years they have been in existence of keeping the politics out of what they do and providing a great empowering capacity building grant process to our community. 

I will be deeply opposing this bill and I say again on record, it is deeply disrespectful to be dealing with this at this time and not to have read the writing on the wall last year and withdrawn the bill. Thank you.
[4.24 p.m.]

Mr ELLIS (Braddon - Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Management) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the minister for bringing forward this important bill. There is such a key priority for this House to ensure that the Tasmanian people's money is spent well and that it delivers the amazing things that our colleagues across the Chamber have spoken about the importance of - support for Apex, for Rotary, for small sporting clubs, for jobs hubs and community transport, a whole range of worthy causes. Those are exactly the kinds of things that the Tasmanian Community Fund was set up to fund.

Imagine that fund funded a political campaign for the No campaign at the last referendum for the Voice. Imagine if those on the other side were confronted with a situation where the campaign that may have been opposed to their own personal point of view had spent not $5000, not $50,000, but $500,000 on a political campaign that was opposed to their views. All of that money could have been put towards children's wellbeing, to active participation in the community, to making a difference for every member of this community,

Members interjecting.

Ms Haddad - You are admitting that this bill was designed to punish them for involvement with the Yes campaign.
The SPEAKER - Members on my left, I appreciate the material is inflammatory but the obligation to the House stands.

Mr ELLIS - The clear point, Ms Haddad, is that regardless of what side a political campaign is on, they should not be funded by the Tasmanian community's money. 

Ms Haddad - You are making it clear that this bill is a political witch-hunt and everything the minister said about governance and so on is not true. It is a witch-hunt.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Clark, Ms Haddad.

Mr ELLIS - Regardless of what side a political campaign is on, it should not be funded by the Tasmanian community's money.   [Bookmark: Phr2_O=28.0_D=28.5_C=0.64] That is the essence of what this is. We need to be fair and impartial. It does not say in the bill that this should only stop people funding the Yes campaign in politics. It does not say that should only stop funding the No campaign.  What it says is that there should not be funding for political campaigns. We know that political parties -

Ms Haddad - It does not say just campaigns, it says political purpose.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Clark.

Mr ELLIS - Political campaigns  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=56.9_D=14.6_C=0.58] are specifically registered. I mean, this argument that there is no way to tell what is political in legislation is frankly ridiculous. It is frankly ridiculous. We know what counts as a political donation -

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=72.0_D=3.4_C=0.86] A member - What about a definition in the bill?

Mr ELLIS - but we do not know what counts as political purposes. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=78.6_D=22.6_C=0.71] 

A member - The Voice made it clear that that is not apparent.

Mr ELLIS - It simply does not make sense.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Clark, Ms Haddad, member for Clark, Mr Bayley, member for Clark, Ms Brown.

Mr ELLIS - You have come in here and passionately spoken about the need for political donation reform, so you clearly know what political is in the context of legislation. 

A member - Put it in the bill then.

Mr ELLIS - I understand that the member for Franklin is relatively new to this place.

Members interjecting.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=103.8_D=5.1_C=0.37] The SPEAKER - The House will be quiet.  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=110.0_D=18.9_C=0.80] The minister will be conscious of the impact of his language. I will ask members not to interject. If they are concerned about the language, they have the opportunity to rise and raise it with me. 

Mr ELLIS - Absolutely. I have been relatively new in this place and probably still am. I was reminded of it many times by Ms O'Connor and others when she was in this place.

Dr Woodruff - Get off your high horse. 

The SPEAKER - The Leader of the Greens, Dr Woodruff.

Mr ELLIS - The reason I mentioned that is there were fundamental mistakes in her speech around regulation being not transparent, being not brought back to this House,  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=142.1_D=29.9_C=0.82] being opaque and unclear. We all know, those of us who have been around for a little while longer, that those get tabled after Question Time every day that there is disallowance. There was a disallowance motion regarding regulation in the other place this week. Regulation is a key part of the way that we deliver the laws and rules of our community and it has to go through this parliament. There are members in this place who sit on the subordinate legislation committee  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=172.2_D=14.3_C=0.86] specifically designed to be working through legislation. That is how the rules and laws of this place work. It is important that we understand exactly what we are saying here. A donation to a political campaign  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=186.9_D=27.4_C=0.82] should not be the kind of thing that a community fund is doing, regardless of what side. 

We pose the question not because we were on a certain side of a political campaign in a referendum, because many of us were. The question is whether that is the appropriate thing for those campaigns to be doing. Of course we have a new board and that is really exciting. We have great people and I commend the minister and our team for  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=215.2_D=2.8_C=0.55] the appointments, and I thank them for the work that they are doing  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=218.5_D=29.8_C=0.86] in advance.

How can we ever let this situation happen again? How can we ever put the people who step up to serve on that board up to the reputational risk of potentially funding a political campaign in the future? I can tell you, Ms Rosol and others who contributed, is this just one person? My electorate voted 72 per cent no. Now, we have a difference of views on this side of the House about that campaign. Minister Jae [Bookmark: Phr14_O=248.6_D=25.0_C=0.77] nsch was publicly a supporter of the Yes campaign. The Premier was a public supporter of the Yes campaign. I was a public supporter of the No campaign, but of the things that we all agree is that it was inappropriate for that sort of money to be used in that political campaign.

Ms Haddad - A beautiful witch-hunt still. You have admitted that tonight.

Mr ELLIS - The 72 per cent of people in my community who voted no  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=274.8_D=3.8_C=0.65] would be deeply distressed to know that their money that could have been used for their kids' footy club  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=279.3_D=25.7_C=0.82] was used to fund the other side. I can also tell you the 28 per cent of those who supported yes, many of those people spoke to me as well about how disappointed that they were that their side's campaign was so damaged by the use of Tasmanian Community Fund money to support that campaign. Those are yes voting people. Those are people who supported the same side as you and they were so disappointed.

Ms Haddad - The board has implemented the Attorney-General's report, so why bring in a blunt instrument like this if it is not for punishment?

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Clark. 

Mr ELLIS - They were so disappointed that money that could have been used to fund community transport in their area was used to support the same side of them in a referendum. Absolutely, because they know what community purpose looks like. They know what political purpose looks like and our job as legislators is to figure out the difference.  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=24.2_C=0.85] In other debates, I can tell you what we know that you do. 

I have spoken already about the confusion about regulation and transparency. I will not go into it too much, other than just to reiterate the minister's comments that there are matters that are dealt with in regulation already in the bill. If we believe that that is not a transparent way of approaching legislation  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=55.4_D=4.3_C=0.68] specifically because obviously we know they are transparent in general, but specifically  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=60.1_D=27.7_C=0.84] to the Tasmanian Community Fund, then we have to acknowledge that it is not just new, it is already in there and that the requirement to take it into account is important. 

I have spoken about who wants this and it is really important for us to acknowledge that it should be broadly bipartisan and that when things are political that we do not involve members of the community. We do not involve, for example, members of the public service when it comes to  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=88.9_D=3.4_C=0.60] political campaigns. I know, for example, the importance of de-identifying  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=92.8_D=29.4_C=0.79] our police, our fire and emergency management staff when we have political campaigns because it is important that they are not seen to be party political. We make commitments in their best interests and perhaps on their behalf, but we do not seek to involve them in the argy bargy, the backwards and forwards that sometimes intense disagreements that can happen in political campaigns, because it is not in the best interest of the state when the public service is politicised to that degree  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=122.3_D=29.8_C=0.85] and when a fund like the Tasmanian Community Fund is politicised to that degree. That is not good for the fund and it is not good for our community. 

I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter. I know that this matter in particular, this specific legislation, is an area of passion for people. There are people who are approaching this with regards to what is in the best interest of the Community Fund.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=152.3_D=27.8_C=0.82] I know that there will be people who will approach this in regards to the particular matter of the Voice and we cannot get around the fact that is such a significant part of this discussion when it is taken up in the community, and I expect probably in this place there will be people who will seek to re-prosecute parts of the failed Yes campaign or to justify that there may be people that will have strong views because of their support for the No campaign.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=181.2_D=1.8_C=0.47] I think we can all in general  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=183.5_D=27.3_C=0.83] agree in a heart of hearts that we should not be politicising for community purpose, that we should not be using community funds to fund political campaigns. Where there is an opportunity to right that wrong and/or to prevent that kind of thing happening in the future, then we should take that moment to do so. If we do not and we come back here in 10, 15, 20 years' time after another referendum,  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=211.7_D=1.8_C=0.35] where a poor decision is made  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=213.8_D=17.5_C=0.88] and the reputation of the Community Fund is affected again, or another kind of fund of similar purpose, then I think that would be dereliction of duty for those of us who sit in this place now. We have an opportunity to do a good thing that is simply common sense for the benefit of the people of Tasmania.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=233.2_D=3.8_C=0.45] [4.35 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=238.6_D=6.2_C=0.89] Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Minister for Business, Industry and Resources) - Honourable Speaker, let us get a few facts on the table and let us get some things clear. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=245.9_D=25.4_C=0.80]  The key stakeholder in this debate is not the board, as was suggested. The key stakeholders are the people of Tasmania. They are the key stakeholder and when you go back and ask how did this fund arise, there were men, and I suggest mainly men, if not only men, who established the Trust Bank  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=272.2_D=1.9_C=0.54] in Tasmania,  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=274.9_D=6.0_C=0.77] they then amalgamated various building societies and  [Bookmark: Phr18_O=282.6_D=15.4_C=0.82] trustee banks and then ultimately it became a commercial decision that for the ongoing viability they would sell that bank to, as I understand it, the Commonwealth Bank.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=300.2_D=4.6_C=0.72] The funds from that sale, given the trustee nature of it, were determined to be invested in a community fund which we now call the Tasmanian Community Fund. It has delivered tremendous benefits right throughout Tasmania into every nook and cranny. It is a tribute to those forebears who established the bank, and the successors of those forebears who sold it, that we had this community fund. It is a community fund which has supported all sorts of community groups and needs right around this state. For that, we thank all those board members who have previously served and those that are currently serving. They have done a great job. They have done a great service for and to the people of Tasmania.

Like with any organisation and people who have been around for a while, every now and then there is either a dereliction of duty or a judgment call that is not as sound as it otherwise might be. The Auditor-General made an assessment or suggestion that the Tasmanian Community Fund should objectively assess their grants. This was a finding by the Auditor-General that was specifically disputed by the then board in circumstances where it was purported that over half a million dollars of Tasmanian money went to a political cause under the guise of 'education'.

If one was genuinely objective and wanting education for the community, would it not have been good and proper to say, 'Yes, this is an important community issue?' I still would have disagreed with it, but at least objectively say, 'This is an important community issue which we consider worthy of funding.' As a result you fund both sides equally so that there can be true community education. I am willing to say in this place - and I trust others who supported the Yes case are willing to say - that there are and were men and women of good faith on both sides of this debate. If you are willing to accept that, you are willing to accept that there were genuine arguments on either side.

In case I need to, I note such luminaries as a former federal president of the Australian Labor Party, Warren Mundine, championed the No cause. I note that Senator Jacinta Price championed the No case.

Ms Haddad - They have implemented the recommendations though, minister. Why have this legislation in the first place?

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Clark.

Mr ABETZ - To make my point about men and women of good faith, even in the electorate of Braddon you had minister Jaensch and minister Ellis on either side of the debate. They are both people of good faith.

Ms Haddad - If that is the objection, minister, with respect, they have implemented the recommendations.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Clark.

Mr ABETZ - They were both well-motivated but willing to coexist. Within the Tasmanian community it was a call which the people of Tasmania overwhelmingly rejected. The people of Tasmania voted overwhelmingly on the No side. It has been interesting that all the people who have been opposing this legislation clearly championed the yes case. That is their right and their privilege. It is a great democracy we live in.

What you have to do with these types of matters is to reflect and ask, 'Do we do this, or debate this and consider this on a tribal basis?' If it is for the yes case, it must be okay. If it is on the No case, then we oppose it.

Ms Haddad - They have implemented the recommendations of the Auditor-General's report, minister. Why legislate in this way?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I will ask the House to come to order. If you are concerned about the content of a speech there are forms of the House that members can raise if they wish. Otherwise, the minister has the call. 

Mr ABETZ - The vehemence of some of the interjections from those who supported the yes case - I understand your disappointment at being part of a losing side. Those of us who have been in politics have been part of a losing side, so I understand -

Ms Haddad - That is so patronising.

Ms DOW - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 151, continued irrelevance and tedious repetition. The points that the minister is making are not even relevant to the debate and contributions.

The SPEAKER - It might be more of a case for Standing Order 142. I suggest you have a quick look at Standing Order 142 rather than that one. I will call the minister. 

Mr ABETZ - It is interesting that I am repudiating and responding to matters raised by previous speakers. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not find those contributions in breach of Standing Orders. When one seeks to respond to that, all of a sudden it is in breach of Standing Orders, according to the Deputy Leader. Once again, with respect, it shows the tribalism that has entered into this debate. It is okay for one side to assert all sorts of things, but it is then wrong for somebody on the other side of the debate to seek to respond, rebut and expose the weaknesses of those arguments.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I will call members to order. There are forms in the House if you are concerned about the content of speeches given by any member. The minister has the call.

Mr ABETZ - The Auditor-General strongly suggested that there needed to be assessments or objective assessments of the grants that are being made. All the board of the TCF disputed every single one of the findings, recommendations, and suggestions of the Auditor-General. Let us be exceptionally clear on that. The board disputed the recommendations and suggestions of the Auditor-General.
Let me also debunk the suggestion that there was only one person who complained about the TCF's allocation of funding to the Yes campaign. You must live in an absolute bubble or have an extremely tin ear to believe that there was only one person who objected to this allocation - or should I say misallocation - of funding.

As this allocation of funding was occurring, I was involved on a voluntary basis with a community group seeking support from that organisation for a community bus. With that funding of $500 000 or thereabouts, they could have funded 10 community buses right around Tasmania. Was that an objective assessment of the allocation of these funds which were not the plaything -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass and member for Franklin. Thank you.

Mr ABETZ - of the board at the time. It was the funds that were held in trust for the benefit of the people of Tasmania.

There were many complaints about this allocation. You only had to read comments in the media, social media and general community discussion. I back the comment of Mr Ellis: his observation that there were many Yes voters who were horrified at this misallocation. They agreed that this attempt, however it was motivated, by the allocation of this money did the Yes campaign damage, as were, might I say, a lot of the corporates who thought they would jump on a winning bandwagon only to be so overwhelmingly repudiated by the people of Australia, damaging their own corporate brands.

That is what unfortunately has occurred for the Tasmanian Community Fund. It has been damaged, not irretrievably, but it has been damaged. The important thing for the people of Tasmania is that this vital, important community fund be looked after and stewarded in a manner that will ensure that the funds allocated from the sale of the Trust Bank  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=25.5_D=5.0_C=0.80] will be used in a manner that will potentially  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.5_D=28.4_C=0.82] see people disappointed but not upset. When I say 'disappointed', this is because there are always more applications for the funding than they can actually give out. It stands to reason that there will be many disappointed community groups when their request for funding is denied.

They have a right to be particularly disappointed when  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=60.8_D=1.8_C=0.85] their request for funding is denied  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=63.3_D=24.6_C=0.78] because under the guise of education the board determined - quite subjectively in my submission, quite inappropriately in my submission - in a manner that was not education in any way, shape or form. It was a political campaign. What is more, it was not even administered  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=88.7_D=4.4_C=0.86] in Tasmania by a Tasmanian organisation  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=93.4_D=14.3_C=0.82] or by a Tasmanian advertising company. In fact, it was sent to Sydney for the national Yes campaign. I have to say, in any objective assessment of that grant,  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=109.5_D=14.3_C=0.79] there was a lot missing in relation to the decision-making by the board. It was an unacceptable decision, a decision that clearly was not supported by the people of Tasmania; a huge No vote. On top of that  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=124.4_D=20.2_C=0.87] there was a substantial body of men and women from the Yes campaign and the Yes side who also saw the inappropriateness of this money being allocated.

Ms Haddad - You are confirming that this bill is a punishment tool.

Mr ABETZ - Is this therefore a witch-hunt against  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=146.2_D=24.9_C=0.74] the TCF?

Ms Haddad - That is what it is.

Dr Woodruff - That is what you have admitted.

Mr ABETZ - No it is not. What it is seeking to do -

Ms Haddad - They have implemented the recommendations. You have got a blunt instrument piece of legislation that is not needed. It is a witch-hunt and a punishment.

The SPEAKER - Order, member for Clark. I do not want to warn you this late in the day.

Mr ABETZ - What it is seeking to do is to ensure that you have proper objective assessment which people can get behind and say, 'Yes, a community bus for Dover or Smithton or on the east coast. That is something that is a community need which we can all get behind'. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=171.6_D=29.9_C=0.80]  They are the sorts of things that the Tasmanian Community Fund made its name on and quite rightly has obtained the overwhelming respect and support of the Tasmanian people. Let us be clear, when they ventured, as they did, they did themselves a lot of brain damage and a lot of reputational damage. A lot of volunteers who spend literally hours  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=201.6_D=29.6_C=0.76] getting submissions together and ready and submitting them to the Tasmanian Community Fund for assessment were bitterly disappointed. They were entitled to be so when their request for funding was just shunted aside for one huge job lot for the Yes campaign of $500,000 plus -

Ms Haddad - No. Other organisations did not miss out on funding. There is no evidence of that. That is fabricated.

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark, I can take a point of order if you wish.

Mr ABETZ - this was not even spent in Tasmania, but shipped off to Sydney for some national campaign. That is something that I would have thought everybody in this House would be able to agree on. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=232.1_D=29.4_C=0.82]  This is undoubtedly why the Auditor-General came to the conclusion, as he did, that this was a suggestion that in future, grants be objectively assessed. On any assessment, shipping the money interstate is hardly something that was intended with a fund, or for a political purpose, hardly intended for the fund. With all this you have got to ask the question: how can we protect the people's money? This is the people's money.
Members interjecting.

Mr ABETZ - They are the key stakeholders. Even if an organisation has done an extremely good job in years gone by and then makes a substantial misstep, the question has to be asked: what are you doing as a government [Bookmark: Phr15_O=292.6_D=12.4_C=0.80] , as the keeper of the fund, to ensure that such a misstep cannot and does not occur again in the future? The government, in supporting this legislation is championing the hundreds of community groups, the hundreds of volunteers who put their heart and soul into supporting  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=28.4_D=0.9_C=0.85] community services  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=29.6_D=30.0_C=0.79] on a volunteer basis right around this state then make an application to this fund, hoping that their application might succeed, and if not they will put it in again and again. To have the application rejected in favour of this fund of which I spoke - completely inappropriate, completely unacceptable - is something that I think the people  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=59.8_D=23.9_C=0.91] of Tasmania would want us to do.

Indeed, I do not think - I know - that is what the people of Tasmania want to do. It is, on any objective assessment, the right thing to do: protect this money, protect the way it is spent to ensure the reputation and the benefit right around the community [Bookmark: Phr5_O=85.0_D=12.6_C=0.63] , keeping in mind the wonderful work of our forebears who established these trustee banks then, and building societies that over time amalgamated and re amalgamated  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=97.9_D=24.8_C=0.79] and then was finally sold off. Their legacy needs to be protected. They established these trustee organisations because they wanted their organisation to be a service to the community. 

The member for Franklin, Mr O'Byrne, talked about the wonderful service that the Launceston Bank for Savings did for him, as [Bookmark: Phr7_O=123.3_D=11.8_C=0.59]  I recall correctly, the Launceston Primary School. For me, it was the Hobart Savings Bank at Blackmans Bay Primary School where we learned to save, count our pennies,  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=135.3_D=30.0_C=0.68] and, yes, that does date me, they were pennies still I think in grade 2 or something. Then we switched to dollars and cents, which made things easier. 

The people who founded these organisations did so out of the sense of community service, so that people had banking institutions and facilities that would help them in their personal lives, in their business lives and just general community service  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=165.7_D=29.6_C=0.85] and to see that which they built being used for a political purpose I think is to deny them the legacy that they are entitled to have. We, as a government, are seeking to protect that legacy, a wonderful legacy, a wonderful service that continues to be, and has the capacity to be of ongoing service to the people of Tasmania with the wonderful grants that they are able to make.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=195.7_D=21.5_C=0.87] Let us get a few things clearly on the record. First, the key stakeholders in this issue are the people of Tasmania: the key stakeholders. Second, this fund needs to be protected to ensure that any payment is made on an objective basis, one that does not  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=219.2_D=0.1_C=0.17] get  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=220.7_D=28.2_C=0.82] community upset and concerned which this clear and gross misstep by the board occasioned to the fund, and a misallocation of half a million dollars - I would have thought - unless you were completely blinded by your support of a particular cause, you could see the inappropriateness of that which was done and the need to protect for it in the future.

[4.55 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=249.9_D=6.6_C=0.54]  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=258.9_D=29.1_C=0.72] Mr BEHRAKIS (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, to start off with, in reading about this bill through the clause notes and the fact sheet, I will read out parts of the summary to really bring this conversation back to what the bill itself is going to do. It explicitly provides direction that the Tasmanian Community Fund board may not directly make grants for political purposes and must act in a professional and impartial manner in performing its functions and exercising its powers more  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=288.4_D=1.2_C=0.13] generally.  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=290.4_D=14.6_C=0.66] The idea that that is something that is a controversial thing to expect, I think it bells the cat. I think tribalism is the right word. As was said, if this was the other way around and the TCF had funded the No campaign, we would be hearing a different conversation. There would be banners drawn out in front of parliament, banners hung from the front of Parliament House -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left. We have only a little bit of time to go.

Mr BEHRAKIS - There will be questions in Question Time, members on the other side and the crossbench asking when is the minister going to do something to stop this from happening.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Order, members on my left. We have four minutes to go before the Adjournment. I am sure we will be debating this bill at length upon our return.

Mr BEHRAKIS - No one is saying that the Tasmanian Community Fund has got this wrong by supporting the Yes campaign. They got it wrong by getting involved in this debate and involved in the political conversation full stop. The notion that this is in some way an attack on the TCF or a witch-hunt is preposterous.

Ms Haddad - You have made it clear, so did Mr Abetz, and so did Mr Ellis.

Mr BEHRAKIS - No, it is not. It is to ensure that a good organisation that does good work - they do fantastic work and they support fantastic community initiatives -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Ms Haddad, order. The member will cease. Ms Haddad, you may take a point of order. There are Standing Orders available to you, but you have to stop yelling at the speakers.

Mr BEHRAKIS - To suggest that the taxpayers and members of the community expect that the money that the TCF is responsible for allocating for community groups and really important initiatives in the community that there should be some level of governance, and the vast majority of Tasmanians, regardless of if they supported the Yes campaign or the No campaign that you talked to on the streets, agree that using these funds, using these community funds for a political campaign on any side and any political purpose is not appropriate.

There are so many community groups that could well use that money. It is a lot of money and to suggest that expecting the TCF to not provide community funds to political purposes of any side should not be a controversial thing. 

We on this side are hugely supportive of the TCF but we want to ensure that money is going to the places where it is supposed to be and is meant to be targeted at. We heard from the Tasmanian Audit Office that raised huge concerns about the way that this was conducted, about the issues with risk management. They found that the public funds administered by the board during the Voice referendum was problematic in the governance and how they justified how they did their due diligence and risk management. There are instructions through ministerial expectations that state entities do not use government money, do not issue grants for political purposes and people of Tasmania rightfully should expect that no money would be used for purposes like that on any side.

To call it a witch hunt to require the TCF to stay out of politics is a preposterous thing to say and to say that this is something that only one -

Debate adjourned.


ADJOURNMENT

[5.00 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) -Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House does now adjourn.


Answer to Question - Land Titles Office - Proposal for Privatisation

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, in answer to the Leader of the Greens' question directed to the Premier concerning the Land Titles Office, I can advise as follows. The Premier is not aware of any unsolicited bid to acquire the Land Titles Office and with your indulgence and that of the House, could I ask that minister Ogilvie be given the call for an answer to Ms Burnet's question.

The SPEAKER - I am happy, given that the Leader gives up his ability to do Adjournments to provide answers to questions to give the Liberal Party the next call on the Adjournment. 


Answer to Question - Salmon Industry - Mass Mortality Crisis

Ms OGILVIE (Clark - Minister for the Environment) - Honourable Speaker, as per my commitment in relation to a question asked by Ms Burnet today, I am advised that no illegal dumping reports of deceased salmon have been made to the Environment Protection Authority (EPA). I am advised that mortality controlled waste is and has historically been received at a number of facilities across the state regulated by local councils and the EPA and are approved to receive and treat and or dispose of these mortalities. These facilities may include landfills, compost facilities, rendering or ensilage units.

While the EPA regulates a number of facilities that accept mortality waste, it should be noted that local councils also approve and regulate mortality waste sites via Environment Protection Notices, or EPS.


Salmon Industry - Mass Mortality Crisis - Access to Information

[5.01 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Honourable Speaker, I rise this evening to reflect on the opacity of the last fortnight in parliament. The Greens tried every day to extract information on the mass salmon deaths in southern Tasmania. The Greens and Mr Garland have suffered through ministers shuffling papers, buck passing questions and giving confusing non-answers. Any information we did get from Liberal ministers was as murky as the Huon and Channel waters are at the moment.

Coastal communities have been suffering for a month with stinky fat balls and oil littering our beaches. All the government did was hand wring and tell Tasmanians that the salmon industry was on notice. We asked what being 'on notice' looks like, and we got no answer. We asked about stocking density, but no minister knew who was responsible for that. We asked about claims of illegal dumping of dead salmon and, you guessed it, the minister did not have the information. We moved for a parliamentary inquiry to have full clarity on this massive, environmentally damaging event but that was roundly rejected by the Liberal and Labor parties. When we asked the Premier how much of the $30 million the Liberals got in the last five years from undeclared donations came from big salmon, he refused to answer.

They are just as stinky as the decomposing salmon that is littering the Huon and Bruny beaches at the moment. After relentless questions and nagging of ministerial officers, Mr Garland and the Greens today got a briefing from the EPA, the Chief Veterinary Officer, Public Health and the Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania. I thank them for that. What we heard made it clear why the Liberal ministers have been shuffling their papers and why the usually chatty salmon industry PR machines have gone into hiding.

Given our job in this place is to represent our communities, we want to share some of what we learned today. We heard it is likely more mortality events are occurring than we have seen publicised. We know that the Chief Veterinary Officer advised that the entire south-east region, including the east coast, are infected with the same bacteria that are in large part responsible for the die-off in the Huon and Channel.

We heard concern that north-south travelling equipment has not been cleaned properly and may be the source of bacterial transportation.

We heard dead fish waste material is overwhelming ensilage and rendering facilities at the moment, and that the 5500 tonnes of dead salmon so far comes nowhere near the quantity that has been removed from the waters.

We heard that fish in Zuidpool South Lease had antibiotics applied on 13 February. Salmon chunks started appearing on 16 February, and yet antibiotics were continually applied by Huon Aquaculture for another 10 days.

The writing was on the wall that this event was unstoppable by the time it reached Verona Sands, yet the company broadcast broad spectrum antibiotic for those 10 days unnecessarily, we believe.

We heard the council-run dumping facilities have not yet been checked for compliance but that the EPA is undergoing an investigation.

We heard that the Chief Health Officer believes there is no negative health effects of rancid fat washing up on public beaches, despite the high possibility of ingestion by children, pets or wildlife.

We heard wild fish are most definitely contaminated by antibiotics.

The failure of Liberal ministers to be in control of, and transparent about, this marine disaster is beyond belief, as is the so-called opposition running cover for both big salmon and the Liberals. Their failures and inaction are astounding. They are both as cosy as each other with big salmon and both utterly disconnected from their communities.

Why would the major parties not want the truth of what is happening; the scale of the damage that is out there? It is because, obviously, the reality of this overstocked, diseased industry reeks. Locals who maybe have been wondering whether they understand what is going on in the finfish industry have been really brought home in the last couple of weeks to the reality of how it is badly managed in Tasmania.

What coastal communities in my electorate have seen for the last month has been revolting. The last fortnight compelled me to bring some of  [Bookmark: Phr1_O=0.1_D=30.0_C=0.78] these stinking salmon fat and oil clumps into this House. These are just some of the chunks. 

The SPEAKER - The member is aware that she is not allowed to bring props into the House. The member is aware she is not allowed to do it. She has been here long enough to know that. Please put them down. 

Dr WOODRUFF - It is very important that the Liberal and Labor members -

The SPEAKER - Please put them down. 

Dr WOODRUFF - especially for Franklin, come and look at these chunks of disgusting, reeking salmon because that is what their constituents are looking at this weekend  [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=28.6_C=0.74] on the beach and probably for at least another month to come. They have been in hiding. They should front their communities. The Liberal and Labor Party should take responsibility for fixing up big salmon in Tasmania. 

Time expired.

Dr Woodruff - Would you like to have a look?

The SPEAKER - No, no, that will not do. 

I am sorry, Mr Ferguson, please resume your seat.

It is not okay to do that. It is an absolute flagrant disregard. You can share this information and these props outside the Chamber. You know the rules well enough, Dr Woodruff.


Aurora Energy Divestment - Comments by Mr Willie

[5.07 p.m.]
Mr FERGUSON (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, thank you for the call. I rise briefly tonight to bring to the notice of the House that, unfortunately, yesterday I saw a press release from the Labor Party. I am usually very thick-skinned and the first to cop it on the chin, but not when it is an outright untruth. 

Yesterday, the member for Clark, Mr Willie, issued a press release which included the following words, ' [Bookmark: Phr4_O=86.5_D=5.9_C=0.88] Michael Ferguson has sensationally admitted that, under the Liberals, Aurora Energy has been on the market for 11 years'.  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=93.9_D=13.1_C=0.88] 'It has been for sale (Aurora Energy) the entire time'. He proudly told the House.

I am very concerned about it.  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=108.6_D=21.6_C=0.75] I will say that, when I saw this press release, I had to do a double take and question myself, 'Did I really say those words?' As is the case with our wonderful support team in IT services, the opportunity for me to see the broadcast and read the Hansard occurred at some time last evening.  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=131.9_D=6.7_C=0.87] When it was available, I was able to feel far more self-assured about what I had said.  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=139.9_D=5.8_C=0.83] No, none of the words in quotation marks were in yesterday's Hansard.  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=147.9_D=1.9_C=0.79] That statement was not in the Hansard.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=152.0_D=3.5_C=0.80] Hansard does record me saying the following: ' [Bookmark: Phr11_O=156.9_D=19.8_C=0.90] He was making politics about Aurora being considered for divestment. Aurora has been considered for divestment for all of the time I have been a member of this House, the 11 years I have been a member of this side of the parliament in the government and the four years that I sat on that side of the House.' [Bookmark: Phr12_O=178.5_D=8.6_C=0.80] 

For a member of the House to issue a public statement that contains fictitious words as a direct quotation  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=187.4_D=1.7_C=0.79] is particularly concerning.  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=190.6_D=24.6_C=0.85] It follows that it is reasonable for a member of the public or the media to assume those words within quotation marks were in fact said by me. That is exactly what one news outlet did believe and reported. I have therefore had to separately advise that outlet that they have unfortunately misreported parliamentary proceedings,  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=215.8_D=4.2_C=0.71] owing to believing the fictitious quote from the member for Clark.  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=220.9_D=29.6_C=0.79] For the record of this House, I was satisfied with the response from that news outlet. 

This is a matter of precedent, of obvious misrepresentation of the proceedings of this House. I regard it as a serious matter. Honourable Speaker, you regard it as a serious matter as you have previously had to bring your concern to another occasion where a broadcast had been edited to misrepresent what had actually occurred.

That is about as much  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=250.6_D=29.8_C=0.84] as I wish to say today on this matter. They are the facts of the matter. I am very disappointed that I am the person standing here correcting the record. It should not fall to me to correct the record, but I do that. It is a serious breach, though, and I believe before having anything further to say about it, the member concerned should take the opportunity himself to have something further to say about misrepresenting proceedings of this House.

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=280.7_D=24.3_C=0.78] The SPEAKER - Before calling the next speaker, the House takes very seriously those sorts of allegations. There are, of course, debating points across the Chamber and those are rightly and freely sometimes a little confronting for people to be involved in. We all have different opinions. However, misrepresentation of members is quite serious. In particular we take that any deliberate or reckless misrepresentation of the House proceedings can constitute contempt. That is why another member has had to come into this House and formally apologise.

It could also be a breach of the Code of Conduct. I take this matter seriously. I hope that all members take that on board and that this matter is resolved without it having to come back to the House. Otherwise it is a significant issue. 

I do not want to see members using Hansard inappropriately. You can use it cleverly - we have all seen that over the years - but inappropriately is not okay. We would not want to have to get to a position of not allowing members to use Hansard in their work as that would completely undermine the process that has been in place for many years.


Exeter Show
Land Titles Office - Proposal for Privatisation

[5.12 p.m.]
Ms FINLAY (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I rise this evening to shout out the Exeter Show Society for an incredible 110th Exeter Show this year, over our break.

It was an incredible, stunning summer day, and a gathering of the community. There are a very few events like the Exeter Show that bring together the Tamar Valley, particularly those communities around the Exeter area. It is one of those great shows that still has its connections to its agricultural past. It also provides great opportunities for the kids and families to enjoy themselves.

On the day, there was show jumping, woodchopping, dog jumping and car displays. There were all sorts of incredible things for the local community to do. There were many community organisations, the Tamar Sea Rescue and the fire brigade. There were fishing demonstrations, information stalls and shearing demonstrations, and all the rides, show bags, and great treats that you can have when you are at a show.

It was an incredible demonstration and display of the talents of the Tamar Valley from people far and wide. There were the home crafts, whether it be the growing of the beautiful vegetables or the flowers. I always love the flower displays when I go to a show - the depth of colour and the beautiful colour, sometimes amazingly large and intricate flowers. I went in early on the day so that it was not crowded so that I could have a good look around.

There was a photographic exhibition as well. At the photographic exhibition, a member of the team from my office, Colleen, shout-out to Colleen, submitted photographs in a photographic exhibition for the first time ever. She was awarded a number of awards including the overall Public and Judges' Choice of the Day.

A shout-out to the Exeter Show Society for a very successful 110th Exeter Show.

There was a comment earlier about the Land Titles Office and how important it is to Tasmania. In the context of the conversation of selling Tasmania's future at the moment, I place on the record the concerns within our community, particularly about archiving and titles, and the history of Tasmania.

The government, on behalf of Tasmanians, is the custodian of an incredible historical archive: documents, titles and conveyancing transactions that date back 200 years. What a wonderful and incredible asset that is held within Tasmania. Records are kept by the government on behalf of the people of Tasmania. Some people might remember back in the day you used to be able to go to buildings and go down into basements and see source documents and original titles. This was important and useful when people were making transactions, but was also an incredible and wonderful experience.

Land titles is connected to my portfolio, as is technology. There should be credit to the government. They have just invested heavily in digitising the records, making them more accessible. I suppose a question would be, having done all that work, would you go to the extent of all that digitising just to privatise? There are so many risks associated to Tasmanians around the records that are held by that potential process. A question on the investment just made: is that the right thing to do, to just let it go?

I have a number of questions about these physical records. What will happen to the physical records if privatised? What will happen to the historical documents? What will it mean for the LIST, which is used every day by many people - not only public servants, but members of the public, businesses and organisations - in their day-to-day work? Will governments have to now pay to access the LIST to do their work every day? Will that then see an increase in the cost to do that for the everyday Tasmanian who wants to make an inquiry into the LIST, for people who are having transactions for government departments? What will it mean to access that valuable and essential critical public asset right now? Are there questions around copyright regarding the historic nature and the personal nature of some of these documents?

I wanted to raise these questions to pose the thought to the government as they go on this pathway of considering selling Tasmania's future and privatising things like the Land Titles Office. We want to make sure that our history is protected, that the people who work in that area are looked after, and that we take deep consideration of the importance of these things before they are simply sold off.

[5.17 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) – Honourable Speaker, I rise to speak tonight about Tasmania Police's response to repeated breaches of the law by Dr Peter Renshaw at the Launceston General Hospital. Early last year, two brave nurses, Tom Millen and Amanda Duncan, spoke to a parliamentary inquiry and made allegations that Dr Renshaw had falsified death certificates and prevented deaths from being reported to the coroner.

The government set up a review of this matter which reported in June. The final report found Dr Renshaw had engaged in a repeated pattern of acting outside the law. The matter was referred to Tasmania Police. In January we heard police had decided not to press charges. This was surprising and distressing for affected families and those who gave evidence to the Department of Health's review.

After hearing from key witnesses to Dr Renshaw's conduct that they were never contacted by Tasmania Police, we wrote to the Police Commissioner seeking a briefing on what they had done to investigate this matter. We are yet to hear back. We followed up the matter with the Police minister in Question Time today. What we heard was really concerning. It sounded much like Tasmania Police did not do their own investigation into this matter and instead only undertook a desktop review of the material provided to them. If police did not do their own investigation - and I cannot interpret what the minister said any other way - that would be deeply troubling. This is a serious matter of public interest. I cannot think of any justification for not having a police investigation.

It is not only the Greens who are disappointed about the way this has been handled. Let me read you the words of Amanda Duncan, one of the nurses who spoke out at the beginning. This is from a letter Amanda wrote to us today:

It is incomprehensible to me that Tasmania Police law enforcement have been clumsy in not asking simple questions to gain simple insights into severe allegations of misconduct by one individual and their employer, which has in fact impacted families across the entire state.

The community expected a robust investigation into the allegations brought forward by families and health staff. Families have reported to me that the DoH were directed to forward medical files to Tasmania Police. However some families stated to me, Tasmania Police reportedly did not receive these files by the DoH. I note who in Tasmania Police had the expertise to clinically review medical files for forensic purposes. If a clinician was engaged, were they independent of the DoH and Tasmania?

As a State Service employee, I am frankly embarrassed by the apparent mishandling of information which myself and other employees strongly believe is, in fact, a systemic issue within the Tasmanian Health Service. It was my expectation that the department of Health and Tasmania Police would work cohesively to seek truth and resolution. Instead, families have been led down the garden path and are reporting they are worse off mentally and emotionally since this supposed investigation commenced.

In my view, the decision made by the Director of Public Prosecutions may be fair and reasonable due to the fact that there appears to be a flimsy desktop review by police in the first instance. This is a dangerous precedent that unethical and potentially criminal practices in hospitals will be tolerated by the health system and police. In my view, this is a significant public health concern.

Thank you for sharing it with us, Amanda, and for allowing us to put it on the parliamentary record.

The Greens have treated this matter with sensitivity and respect ever since it arose. We do not raise this again simply to make a point or to push an agenda. We believe in justice. We believe justice requires a rigorous investigation by police, not a desktop review.

Finally, I want to note the progress of this matter in the Coroner's office. The matters uncovered by the review were referred to the Coroner's office in June. However it took until 28 January, over six months, for them to appoint an independent clinical nurse to review the cases referred to them. There was no explanation for that delay, but we do understand the major resourcing challenges facing the Coroner's office. We call on the government to provide any additional resources it may need to make sure this work is able to be done in a timely manner. The affected families deserve that at the very least.


Aurora Energy Divestment - Comments by Mr Ferguson

[5.21 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.6_D=3.1_C=0.46]  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=35.6_D=26.6_C=0.83] Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to respond to the member for Bass's comments earlier on this adjournment debate. I am glad he is still reading my press releases, even though he is on the backbench. I have been enjoying some of his contributions from the backbench, trying to stay relevant, trying to participate in the debate still.

Yesterday he was quite indignant about some of the commentary about Aurora.  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=63.2_D=5.7_C=0.81] In his contribution he said that Aurora had been considered for divestment for all the time that he had been a member of this House,  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=69.4_D=29.5_C=0.81] the 11 years that he had been a member of that side of the parliament in the government, and for the four years he sat on the other side of the House. He talked about the ministerial statement of expectations. He finished his contribution by saying, 'What are you people talking about? It has been prepared for sale this entire time.' 

I said in a press release that he said it has been for sale the entire time. I have missed out the word 'prepared'  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=99.4_D=7.9_C=0.80] for sale, so I will correct the record there. However, I think it just goes to show that the member for Bass  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=107.5_D=29.6_C=0.82] is struggling with his new position in the parliament. He is trying to stay relevant. He has been in this place for a very long time. I think this is a minor thing and he should grow a thick skin.

The SPEAKER - Before calling the next person, whilst that may be a debating point made by the member for Clark, deliberate, reckless or even inadvertent misrepresentation of the House's proceedings do constitute a potential breach. I believe we should take it a little more seriously, although the rest of your contribution was certainly appropriate  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=137.7_D=2.2_C=0.71] debating points.


Kunanyi/Mount Wellington - Zip-Line Proposal

[5.23 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=147.8_D=22.4_C=0.87] Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, last night's Hobart planning committee considered the zip-line proposal which consisted of a 25-metre high tower rising from The Springs near the heritage-listed gardens, the line itself running 1.2 kilometres and having vegetation clearance for the landing  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=172.2_D=6.8_C=0.74] at Strickland Falls. This proposed zip-line was modelled on another in New Zealand by the same proponent - [Bookmark: Phr11_O=179.6_D=29.2_C=0.84]  part of a theme-park approach for Kunanyi. It was rejected by a majority decision by the City of Hobart last night at their planning committee.

This was the latest such scheme designed to turn this special place into a theme park. The Greens expect that it will not be the last. Almost 800 submissions reached the planning committee, the vast majority in opposition. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=209.1_D=28.0_C=0.79]  Then some deputations spelled out those planning considerations pitted against the proponent and their witnesses. To have almost 800 representations is a very large interest in a proposal. It is important to hear from the public to frame your response - not only considering the professional planning advice of the application. That is what the people on the planning committee would have had to consider.  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=238.0_D=5.0_C=0.85] I thank those who took the time to make their voices heard.  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=243.4_D=29.8_C=0.86] As a former member and chair of Hobart's planning committee, I took my role very seriously. Hearing those voices would have been very important for the planning committee members as well. 

The large number of representors were placing their trust in a democratic process. They were having their voices heard on planning matters. They were placing their faith in the chance to be heard, to be represented by their  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=273.4_D=28.6_C=0.80] local government elected representatives - just like they did with the last cable car debate considered in early 2020. It was appealed at TASCAT in November 2022. If this zip-line decision is appealed - and I suspect it may not go to appeal,  [Bookmark: Phr16_O=302.8_D=2.1_C=0.71] we will have to wait and see - it would be heard through the TASCAT process.

Parties can be heard, it can be considered, it can even come out with a mediated process. However, the Liberals want to take away that right for a third-party appeal. They do not like seeing democracy at work; they are scared by the prospect, even with something as precious and as important as Kunanyi is to many Tasmanians and not only those who are direct neighbours.

Mr Felix Ellis, the minister, also wants to create, through his development assessment panels, a parallel process for developers like the proponent of the zip-line or any cable car proposal that might roll in, no doubt supported by the Liberals. It gives greater emphasis on assessment panels and takes more out of the hands of the community who should be heard loud and clear.

With the minister, Mr Abetz's, review of the mountain due later this year and the minister's capacity as minister for Business, the Greens are concerned there will be all manner of spurious development recommended for the mountain, designed to hand yet more public land over to profit-seeking entrepreneurs.

Last night's decision was a great example of why community voices in planning decisions and the right to object to projects that will affect everyone are so important. It demonstrates again why development assessment panels would do irreparable damage to the functioning of local government. It is important that everyone who will be affected by developments has the right to have their say, to protect our important landscapes such as Kunanyi.


TasTAFE - Workplace Morale - Fears of Job Cuts

[5.28 p.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, the situation unfurling at TasTAFE is extremely disturbing and is only made worse with further uncertainty for TasTAFE's future under the government's new Trumpian blueprint privatisation agenda. Workplace morale is already low with staff on stress leave. We have been told of many taking out bullying complaints and alleged unfair dismissal.

On Seek, reviews for work at TasTAFE paint a concerning picture. Overall, it has received 1.9 star rating out of five. To quote some of those reviews:

A very unethical employer
A toxic workplace
Lack of investment in modern teaching resources
Lack of involvement with industry
Complaints covered up
Lack of leadership in the organisation.

The toxic workplace is widely known throughout Tasmania. This is shameful and we have to amend it. We understand that half of the automotive teachers risk losing their jobs, including two of the three electrical teachers. That is seriously concerning because vehicle electrical is a specialist area. Teachers in this space are hard to come by. Professionals generally get paid a lot more working in the industry than they do training the experts of the future. In a world of rapid internal combustion to electric vehicle transition, why on earth would any electrical technician be considered in any possible cuts? This move is completely out of touch. It shows the divide between the industry and the rapid cuts in the training sector. This is off the back of multiple incidents at Campbell Street.

The Tasmanian government should have stepped up and they should have planned for a state-of-the-art facility. The Campbell Street centre has been aged for quite some time so progressive planning should have begun some time ago. Here was a chance for an automotive centre of excellence for contemporary accessible EV training courses.
Now with the closure of Campbell Street in the south, apprentices have to go north for training. In Question Time, the minister pointed to the trade training centres as an option in the south, but these were set up for pre-employment training. When was all the necessary equipment for training apprentices installed there, minister?

Also in Question Time, the minister made some laughable claims about there being more apprentices in the north than the south. No kidding, right now, because there is nowhere for them in the south. Rest assured, there are plenty of apprentices down here and, most importantly, the businesses that need them in the south of the state. We have examples of apprentices down here who were given just three days' notice to go for their TAFE block training in the north. Three days for them to find the transport. These are young adults, some as young as 16 years old, but most pressingly, this was three days' notice for employees for their businesses to change their plans, to alter in-booked services and to inform their customers. 

Then there is this proposed move to streamline to the Victorian Automotive Chamber of Commerce (VACC) delivery model, a model that has not been broadly asked for by the industry, not by employers and not by the students themselves. It appears it is purely only a budget-saving measure fast-tracked by the Campbell Street flooding incident. This reduces the time that apprentices spend training at TAFE in a controlled, safe learning environment with experienced teachers, and it puts the training load onto the employer. Training in a specialty facility with appropriate learning and supporting tools at hand is absolutely critical. We do not want to just say apprentices head out and start rebuilding brakes on a public member's car first when there should be options in place in an appropriate facility.

I can absolutely vouch this does happen. I began my training in automotive in such a facility before going on to Campbell Street, where it was far more controlled and the public had a lot more confidence in what was happening. We have to have these facilities available.

What does this bungled move mean for course completion rates? Are we going see people in the south simply not be able to complete their apprenticeships? This is certainly not the right road to travel to future proof and involve training for the Tasmanian automotive industry when we are moving forward. To be clear, automotive is just one important sector of TasTAFE. This is the hub for the future trades; critical care workers for those who compose an important part of Tasmania's economy.

It was disappointing that the news of TasTAFE's CEO departure was in the headlines in Victoria over a week before it was news here. What are the recruitment processes from here? Noting that under the TasTAFE act, the board must consult with the minister before making an appointment. This is a minister who looks to be making cheap measures instead of long term planning. This is a minister who has seen the 30-month statutory independent review of the implementation of the TasTAFE (Skills and Training Business) Act 2021. It has not even begun, all while VET student numbers are dropping and the Liberals still have not hired 100 extra TAFE teachers as they promised to in 2021.

This is unacceptable and it is shameful. We must have transparency around TasTAFE. The legislatively required independent review must commence, and the minister must rule out privatising TasTAFE. Most importantly, he must rule out any forced redundancies or job cuts.


Kunanyi/Mount Wellington - Zip-Line Proposal - Greens' Stance

[5.33 p.m.]
Mr BEHRAKIS (Clark) - Honourable Speaker. I was not planning on speaking, but I feel like I have to after one of those contributions from Ms Burnet. I think the Greens have belled the cat in regard to this. Like many Tasmanians, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the news that the zip-line project was going to go to council with a recommendation for approval. It is quite exciting. We will have a really good tourism venture, something that is going to be very usable and low impact on the mountain. 

The comments by the Greens both in here and outside of this place really do bell the cat. I remember when the cable car project went before the council and was rejected. The talking points at the time by those who rejected it were - I do not know, it is not ideological, it is because it did not comply with the planning scheme, I think it was 21 or 23 criteria of the planning scheme.

Unlike everybody else, we are respecting the planning rules. We had something last night that came to the council that emphatically, according to the same planning office, complied with the planning rules. Given the sensitivity of the matter, I expect they took some pretty serious care in making sure that they got this right. They emphatically supported it.

On the topic of the definitions, once again, that was all considered in the planning report. The expert planning officers; the number of times I was lectured by my now fellow member for Clark when I was on the council and she chaired the Hobart City Council planning committee - and I am glad that she brought that up as well - about respecting the advice of our good planning staff, and of course, we do. To then just completely ignore it and assume that they have not taken these things into consideration - that was all in the report.

It does speak to the Greens' attitude when it comes to planning rules. They like to lecture and claim that they are the only ones who respect the rules of the day. They like to talk about how important it is that we respect planning rules. The reality is that the Greens only respect the planning rules when the planning rules are useful as a tool to oppose development. The only consistency here is that when there is a development, there will be the Greens using an argument to oppose it. When the cable car came up and it was recommended by planning officers for refusal, it was refused. When the zip-line came up as recommended for approval, they refused. When we have applications like the Welcome Stranger - recommended for refusal, in fairness, but was refused. Then we had, I think, 202 Macquarie St emphatically recommended for approval, and refused. I am seeing a very common theme here.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=27.4_D=20.7_C=0.35] You know, the deputy - I almost called you the deputy Lord Mayor, sorry -
The SPEAKER - May I remind people that we are in a much more important place.

Mr BEHRAKIS - Indeed. The member for Clark spoke about her time as chair of the planning committee. During that time - I will not read the whole list of stats that I read out yesterday - she voted for the refusal of 536 dwellings, 256 of which were recommended for approval.

The Greens can talk about their respect for the planning rules or the respect for the rules in general, but they are only respected insofar as it is useful to them. The number of times we have heard about not approving development because of heritage reasons - like the Welcome Stranger, which was not even on the heritage site,  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=75.2_D=9.2_C=0.66] recommended for refusal because of heritage concerns. The knocking down of the derelict former Rebels clubhouse to put housing there was voted against as well.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=86.0_D=23.3_C=0.75] When the times call for it, when it is convenient to the cause, we do not mind endorsing people climbing up the front of our very old, heritage-listed Parliament House, doing who knows what sort of damage to the slate roof and then throwing rigging off the sides of it. If that was done in any other context, we would have  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=111.1_D=13.4_C=0.51] protests and lectures galore. The Greens need to take a good hard look at themselves. People need to listen to what they say in this. They really did bell the cat as far as where they stand. The only consistency here is that if there is something being proposed for this state, the Greens will be against it.


Kunanyi/Mount Wellington - Zip-Line Proposal

[5.38 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=126.8_D=16.6_C=0.39] Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Listen to this, then, Mr Behrakis. 

Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to again talk about Kunanyi/Mount Wellington, this time in celebration of the vote of the Hobart City Council and its rejection of a private commercial zip-line proposal from The Springs to Strickland Falls.  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=143.8_D=29.8_C=0.79] Last week on Adjournment I spoke of my disappointment at the recommendation of the planning officer that the development be approved. This was despite non-compliant reports and the proposal being passed off as a transport depot, not the adventure tourism development it clearly is as described in the very first line of the development application.

I also spoke about my frustration, verging on anger, at another private commercial development detested by Aboriginal people and on an acknowledged Aboriginal cultural  [Bookmark: Phr9_O=173.9_D=29.9_C=0.78] landscape of immense spiritual value that was assessed against the flawed Aboriginal Heritage Act.

Over three and a half years ago the government came into this place and acknowledged that the act does not work. Here we are again, another destructive development recommended to be waved through against an ineffective act. To add insult to injury, the Aboriginal Heritage Assessment Report did not even comply with the government's own guidelines for the surveys, consultation and authoring of such a report. This is a deep shame on you on the government benches.  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=203.9_D=30.0_C=0.79] I heard the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs update the House on progress on a new act in her state of the state speech. Aboriginal heritage needs action, not words. With the Development Assessment Panel, State Coastal Policy, and Stony Rise bills, you have demonstrated that you can act when it is in the interests of developers. Get on with it for Aboriginal people.

I congratulate the community for again standing up to defend Kunanyi: 828 representations were received with them, in the words of the planner's report, almost exclusively opposed to the proposal. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=234.4_D=29.6_C=0.80]  A small group of community members banded together some time ago to meet to discuss the proposal and coordinate the response. They established the alliance, Friends of the Mountain, and engaged strongly in the council process.

Sadly, I missed their deputations to the Hobart City Council Planning Committee last night, but I understand they were deep, passionate, compelling and clearly influential. I will not name names and identify groups, but I acknowledge here and now the incredible efforts of individuals and organisations  [Bookmark: Phr12_O=264.1_D=30.0_C=0.80] in analysing the development application, interpreting it against the management plan and planning scheme, engaging and mobilising people, and ultimately convincing councillors to vote the way they did.

Congratulations and thank you. Kunanyi is lucky to have such a dedicated, passionate cohort of lovers willing to drop everything and stand up to advocate for the values of the mountain. Hobartians are truly blessed to have Kunanyi as a backdrop to our city, for the beauty, the amenity, the economic drive, and the natural and cultural heritage  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=294.2_D=10.8_C=0.67] values. Kunanyi is connected to the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area by protected lands. What we see from Nipaluna is the spectacular and accessible eastern face of a conservation landscape that stretches from Fern Tree to the very far south-west coast. Kunanyi is lucky to have this cohort. 

The anti-environmentalists in the Liberal Party are coming, with Mr Abetz's so-called 'strategic review' that will look at the tenure and governance of the mountain. It is transparently clear, likely reinforced by this latest decision, that the strategy of the review is to loosen their protections, clear the path and pave the way for private commercial development on Kunanyi. This government has form in changing long-standing rules in the way parks and reserves are managed to allow for private commercial developments that cut across both credible values management and community sentiment. We will need you to again stand up to Mr Abetz and those keen to capitalise on undeveloped public land for their own personal, commercial gain.

For now, thank you. I acknowledge and thank those councillors who voted following deep thought and their own analysis with conscience and in line with community expectations. This decision is a win for community and a planning process that allows for proper community engagement, community representations and a decision in the community interest. It was a decision that went against the incorrect advice of the council's planners. It also highlights the importance of merit-based appeal. The proponent has recourse. He has the right to appeal - a right unsuccessfully exercised by the Mount Wellington Cableway Company when it too was rejected by councillors, this time in line with planners' advice.

This council decision is a good decision made in the face of a deficient application and bad planning advice. It was made by councillors but it was driven by people. To you all, congratulations, well done and thank you.


Wayne Simmons - Tribute

[5.43 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to make a contribution about the passing of Wayne Simmons. Wayne Simmons was a valued member of the Huon Valley community, but also part of the Labor Party family.

Wayne was somebody who I got to know from when I entered parliament. He was a mentor to many people in our movement, a friend to even more, and someone who was always there to provide advice. As I said at his wake, he was someone who provided advice, most of the time when you wanted it, but oftentimes when you did not. That is the sort of guy he was. He was always there to provide me with advice. Right up until January when he passed away, he was a pretty regular contact of mine.

The power of Wayne in the community was felt most heavily recently through his presidency of the Rotary Club of the Huon Valley, in particular in his fundraising efforts through all sorts of events, felt most passionately through the Hilltop Hike. Wayne sat on the committee for the Hilltop Hike and was passionate about mental health in the valley. He understood that in regional places like the Huon Valley, and across Tasmania, there is not enough support for people doing it tough. In regional communities it can be really tough to get access to the support you need at the right time. Travel is difficult for a lot of people. He was on the ground providing mental health first aid, and also advice to those who needed it. 

His work with the Huon Valley branch of the Labor Party - I was able to award Wayne the award for our Labor Party Branch of the Year last year for all the volunteering that they did. They did not only go to meetings. For political parties here, you will know the meetings that we have where we debate the big issues and then we all go home. He did not just do that. He set up a transport forum for Meg Brown and me to engage with local community. He brought in groups from all over the valley so that we could discuss transport and how important it was in the regional community. He was someone who, as president, led the Huon Valley Branch for a long time.

The circumstances of his passing, given his incredible contribution to the Hilltop Hike and to mental health, were tragic. I will miss him. I will miss him an incredible amount.

I wanted to pay tribute not just on behalf of me and the party, but also on behalf of people he has mentored. I cannot think of anyone in my life who supported someone like he supported Toby Thorpe, the Deputy Mayor. Wayne continued to support Toby as the Deputy Mayor, and also as a candidate for the Labor Party. He grabbed someone who was young, who he could see had a huge amount of talent and potential, and nurtured him. I know Toby and all of us are still feeling the loss.

On behalf of the Labor Party and the people I represent, I pass on my condolences to Jan, his children and grandchildren, and all those who helped and were inspired by Wayne and the beautiful life he led.

The House adjourned at 5.46 p.m.

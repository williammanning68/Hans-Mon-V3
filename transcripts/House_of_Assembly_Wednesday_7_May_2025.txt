QUESTIONS

Government Economic Agenda - Land Tax and Stamp Duty Reform

Mr WINTER question to MINISTER for FINANCE, Mr JAENSCH

[10.01 a.m.] [Bookmark: Phr4_O=48.8_D=0.9_C=0.84] 
 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=53.4_D=24.1_C=0.85] Your government has taken Tasmania from having zero net debt in 2014 to nearly $10 billion worth of net debt today. Your government has a plan to cut 2500 jobs from the public service, impose a blanket hiring freeze on many of our essential services, and announced a plan to privatise assets Tasmanians have built together for 100 years.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=78.6_D=4.3_C=0.85] Have you also been directed by the Premier to undertake long-term [Bookmark: Phr7_O=83.4_D=8.6_C=0.75]  land tax and stamp duty reform, and if so, can you update the House as to what that is? 

ANSWER
 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=93.3_D=24.6_C=0.84] 
Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question and his interest in Tasmania's budget and the plan for a pathway back to surplus. He has listed some of the very many tools and options on the table that our government is looking at and exercising to ensure that we are building our pathway back to s [Bookmark: Phr9_O=118.8_D=10.2_C=0.75] urplus, which will be seen in a couple of weeks in the state government's Budget when it is brought down. We look forward to Labor's alternative budget and its strateg [Bookmark: Phr10_O=129.4_D=25.7_C=0.77] ies for returning our state to surplus as well.

As you hopefully do, I receive feedback, commentary and questions from constituents - businesses, landowners, individual citizens - all the time regarding the government's settings in land tax, payroll tax, stamp duties of various kinds, and initiatives that we have introduced to stimulate [Bookmark: Phr11_O=156.0_D=3.4_C=0.85]  the building and construction industry to enhance the availability [Bookmark: Phr12_O=159.8_D=29.9_C=0.80]  of family-size homes, from people who are downsizing to young people getting into housing for the first time. We hear from a range of different businesses that are reaching thresholds for the first time, paying payroll tax, because they are growing. They are growing their businesses in Tasmania, employing more Tasmanians, which is a good thing. We are constantly hearing from Tasmanians who are interacting with our taxation and duty systems and we always take note of the issues that they raise.

The Premier has [Bookmark: Phr13_O=189.8_D=29.7_C=0.83]  asked me, as Finance minister, to be looking at what the future of our own state revenue system may look like in the form of duties and taxes. I have asked the Department of Treasury and Finance for advice on previous reviews that have been undertaken; new ideas, things that are happening in other states and territories that we might consider here as part of the mix.

We are not pulling anything off the table - except we will not be introducing new taxes. We will not be increasing any existing taxes.  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=219.9_D=14.6_C=0.78] Where we can make our taxes more sensible to people and more consumer-friendly, where we can reduce bill shock, where we can smooth payments, liabilities and obligations that people have, we will definitely look at that. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=234.7_D=9.5_C=0.89]  We will keep listening to Tasmanians regarding what they need. We will keep ensuring that our taxation that we do have is fair and efficient, but we will not be adding new taxes or increasing taxes.


Government Economic Agenda - Land Tax

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=246.2_D=5.6_C=0.82] Mr WINTER question to MINISTER for FINANCE, Mr JAENSCH

[10.05 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr17_O=252.6_D=29.4_C=0.87] In this letter from the Premier, sent to you on 1 November 2024, it asks you to prioritise and focus on delivering land tax and stamp duty reform. It says he will be meeting with you regularly to assess progress and that he and his team, I quote: 'can provide any assistance you may require in progressing towards our shared goals and objectives'. Are you developing any plan to replace stamp duty with a broad-based land tax? [Bookmark: Phr18_O=282.2_D=8.1_C=0.80]  Has your minority government blown this budget so badly that you are planning now to impact a land tax on the Tasmanian family home?

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=292.4_D=2.1_C=0.84] ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=299.5_D=5.2_C=0.74] No, we are not taxing the family home. It is a reflection on you, Mr Winter, and your opposition at the moment that the best you can manage is to try to scare people. 

When we have a situation where you, on one hand, demand that the government takes urgent action and shows a plan for returning us to surplus and then, on the other hand -

Mr Willie - You have not shown a plan. There is no credible evidence.

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark.

Mr JAENSCH - come out every day and try to speculate, conflate, worry people -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass.

Mr JAENSCH - worry Tasmanians who may already be under cost-of-living pressure, having trouble paying their bills. We are sensitive to that; we hear those concerns. You come out and try to put a fear into people - 

Mr Winter - It is in the letter.

Mr JAENSCH - that their house is going to be taxed under a new land tax by this government. That is not going to happen, Mr Winter. You are absolutely wrong and you are wrong to be doing that to Tasmanians who might be under cost-of-living pressures right now. 

There is nothing in any letter that you wave around that might have been written to me by the Premier that says we are going to put a land tax on people's own homes. It is irresponsible for you to suggest so and I can categorically rule it out.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I remind members to put their questions and answers through the Chair so we can avoid interjections. We are not having a repeat of yesterday.

Mr WINTER - Honourable Speaker, I have a supplementary question stemming from the minister's question.

The SPEAKER - I will hear it, but I believe the minister has answered.

Mr WINTER - Stemming from the minister's question, he has listed things that he will not do, but can he explain to the House what he is considering as part of the Premier's request to oversee long-term land tax and stamp duty reform?

The SPEAKER - The original question was: were you going to replace stamp duty with a broad-based land tax? I believe the minister answered that by saying no. He has identified a range of options he would do. I would argue that he has answered the question. However, you do have an opportunity for another five questions.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Ministerial Role

Ms BURNET question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.08 a.m.]
Your government's attack on planning has been on full display. The steamroller approach hit a new low with your move towards special stadium legislation. At a briefing on Monday, we were told your government is considering giving the minister a central role in the stadium approval. We were told a minister may be given the power to oversee and enforce conditions placed on the stadium if it is approved by parliament. The community would be disturbed by this prospect.

Given your government's build-the-stadium-at-any-cost approach, there is no way any minister could be trusted to honestly make sure crucial conditions are being met. Giving a Liberal politician final sign-off on key parts of the stadium would be your worst corruption of process yet. Will you rule out your stadium legislation containing any element of ministerial discretion, sign-off or ability to modify the plans?

The SPEAKER - I call the Premier and remind members that if they wish to allege issues such as corruption, they may do so by a substantive motion only. 

Dr Woodruff - There was no reference to corruption. It is about process.

The SPEAKER - I do not need interjections from the Leader of the Greens.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I reject the premise of the question and find the language offensive. The Greens are very good at it. Anyone who does not agree with you, irrespective of the view or topic, is somehow corrupt - 
Mr Bayley - Corruption of process, Premier. Listen.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader of the Greens. we are not having this today.

Mr ROCKLIFF - That is why Australians rejected you at the federal election: too far, too extreme. You are out of touch, and you are not standing up for Tasmanians, you are not standing up for - 

Ms BURNET - Point of order, standing order 45, relevance.

The SPEAKER - I will take 45, relevance. The Premier will come to the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - This is a key project on which we differ. I am passionate about it, as you know. I stand up for what I believe in, and what is I believe in the best interests of this state, as difficult as that may be politically. Why would you bother wanting to be on the government benches if you did not want to make tough decisions? We are elected to make decisions. Some of those decisions are difficult and some of those - 

Ms BURNET - Point of order.

The SPEAKER - I will hear the point of order, but remind members about frivolous points of order. 

Ms BURNET - Again, the Premier seems to be -

The SPEAKER - No, what is your point of order?

Ms BURNET - Relevance.

The SPEAKER - I will take the point of order on relevance again. Premier, I draw your attention to the question again.

Dr Woodruff - Rule it out.

The SPEAKER - Also, I will not take interjections from the Leader of the Greens.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We are offering briefings to all sides of parliament in terms of where we are now, taking feedback on what individual members of parliament feel are their concerns when it comes to the enabling legislation.

We had enabling legislation in this parliament in 2003, if my memory serves me correctly, for the Meander Dam. The Meander Dam had bipartisan support. Without the Meander Dam, there would still be floods throughout Deloraine, there would be no water for farmers, and there would be no economic growth. This is why you make tough decisions. That is why, as shadow minister for Primary Industries, I backed the then-minister for Primary Industries, Bryan Green, to bring in that enabling legislation.

The Parliament Square precinct involved enabling legislation; the stadia infrastructure required in Brisbane for the Olympics has had enabling legislation; Optus Oval, enabling legislation; Adelaide Oval, enabling legislation. 
The community has been consulted -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. I will hear the supplementary.

Supplementary Question

Ms BURNET - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question. 

Ms BURNET - The Premier has gone nowhere near my question, which was: will you rule out your stadium legislation containing any element of ministerial discretion, sign-off or ability to modify the plans? It is a simple question.

The SPEAKER - I will draw the Premier to the original question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Submissions to the current process finish on 8 May. Those views will be taken into account when we are drafting legislation. Various views will be taken into account when drafting legislation. You will have the opportunity to scrutinise that legislation at the time. I am going to listen to the views of Tasmanians, along with our team. We will listen to the views of your good selves. You will have the opportunity to scrutinise that legislation and either pass that legislation or not. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark, you have had your question and the supplementary.

Mr ROCKLIFF - If the legislation is not passed, the stadium will not go ahead, the team will not go ahead and the Project of State Significance (POSS) process will not go ahead.


Public Transport - Metro Tasmania Half-Price Fares

Mr O'BYRNE question to MINISTER for TRANSPORT, Mr ABETZ

[10.14 a.m.]
Last month you conceded half-price fares had not led to an uplift in passengers on buses on Metro Tasmania. However, passenger numbers for private bus operators tell a different story. Two local operators have experienced an 18 per cent increase of all fare classes compared to this time last year. This includes a 32 per cent increase in adult passengers on one service which runs shorter routes, a 24 per cent increase in concession passengers on a service that runs a longer route and a 10 per cent increase in students travelling on weekends. Is it not the reality that the idea of half-price fares is a good one but Metro is incapable of delivering? 

Rather than make the mistakes of previous ministers who failed to intervene when GBEs perform poorly, will you finally intervene and act to ensure Metro steps up and provides the important public transport services Tasmanians deserve?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. The member is right in relation to the half-price bus fares, which were designed as a cost-of-living measure for a period of 12 to 13 months. It has been implemented and worked relatively well. It has not seen an uplift in passenger numbers in relation to suburban areas, but the long-haul routes, such as in our electorate from Huonville to the city, Queenstown to Burnie, and there appears to have been a fairly substantial increase on the east coast. I had a discussion with Shane Dewsbery, 'Bubbles', just the other day about that matter. 

Our policy is as per the announcements. If there is anything further to be said on that, undoubtedly the Treasurer will say something on Budget day.

Supplementary Question

Mr O'BYRNE - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary.

Mr O'BYRNE - I appreciate you are not going to forecast the half-price fares, but the issue was more about your responsibility for your state-owned company and their obligation to the Tasmanian people. It is not a matter of half-price fares; it is a matter of your responsibility. Will you intervene and finally start to lift Metro's performance?

The SPEAKER - The original question was about intervention. I will call the Minister for Transport.

Mr ABETZ - I accept what the member says as to the other aspect of the question. The member can be assured that I take an active interest. In the 12 months or so that I have been Minister for Transport, which includes Metro, I have observed certain things, and it is my view that there is potential for improvement.

Without saying too much, those discussions continue with a relatively new chair of the board, Mr Braxton-Smith, and a new member of that board as well who has been appointed in relatively recent times.

I believe Metro, like all GBEs, can always improve its performance. I am always looking to see how that performance can be improved, for one simple reason: there is an obligation to the Tasmanian people to make sure that our GBEs perform to the very best of their ability.

The SPEAKER - The minister's time for answering the question has expired.


Budget Debt - Impact of New Borrowing

Ms JOHNSTON question to TREASURER, Mr BARNETT

[10.18 a.m.]
One of your fiscal strategy targets is to keep net debt below 10 per cent of gross state product. You are not going to meet that target - not by a long shot. The figure in your own Revised Estimates Report shows it is going to be 14.2 per cent of gross state product by the end of June, and that is before you add the massive new stadium borrowings.

Treasurer, will you be honest in your accounting and show the Tasmanian people the true impact of your new borrowing on net debt relative to gross state product, or will you continue to pretend Tasmanians will not be paying it back and use tricky accounting to hide it in a different ledger?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. It is a very important question, because it goes to the Budget that will be delivered on 29 May. We will certainly have more to say at that time, but I can assure the member and this House that we have a very strong plan.

A hallmark of that Budget will be strong economic management. It will be responsible economic management with a pathway to surplus. What that means is we will continue to ensure that we have a strong economy that will deliver jobs and opportunity for Tasmanians.

Yes, the debt reference that you have made is important. With a pathway to surplus and with our efforts to build a strong economy and responsible economic management, we will ensure that we get the balance right. It will not be 'slash and burn', as has occurred in the past under a former Labor-Greens government. It will be measured and sensible, but with a pathway to surplus.

The debt needs to be manageable, and you have made reference to that.

Mr Willie - It is in freefall.

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark, it was not your question.

Mr BARNETT - It needs to be manageable. In terms of general government debt to revenue and debt per capita, we are amongst the lowest in Australia. I am pleased with that record, but it does need to be manageable and sustainable. A lot of work has been put into it; we have received lots of feedback and we are working with business and industry.

Responsible economic management will be a hallmark of this Budget, with that pathway to surplus. It will support business and industry, as we have been doing with the transformation of our government business enterprise reform process. There is a lot more work to do. I am looking forward to delivering that Budget on 29 May.

Supplementary Question

Ms JOHNSTON - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the member for Clark with a supplementary.

Ms JOHNSTON - It goes to the original question, Treasurer: will you be hiding the impact of the new borrowings on a different ledger?

The SPEAKER - The original question was about the impact of the new borrowings. I will call the Treasurer to the original question, please.

Mr BARNETT - Thank you for the supplementary question. It will be very clear, open and transparent. The Budget will be quite open and transparent in the usual way. That will be my expectation and that is what I will deliver on Budget day. 


Macquarie Point Stadium - Outstanding Reports and Public Consultation

Mr BAYLEY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.21 a.m.]
Last week, the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) wrote to the stadium proponent seeking two outstanding reports the proponent promised would be submitted by the end of March - five weeks ago. One was a conservation management plan for the Goods Shed and the Red Shed, and the other was a flooding report, critical given the flooding risk already identified by the TPC.

The reports have not been submitted and made public. Public consultation on the TPC's draft report finishes tomorrow and many people have already lodged their representations. This is yet another example of your government treating Tasmanians with utter contempt. Do you not agree the public deserves to have all information available before consultation concludes? Is this not more evidence your special legislation is designed to avoid a damning planning assessment in the absence of all necessary information and deny Tasmanians a genuine say?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, no, this is about Tasmanians having their say and -

Mr Bayley - Without the information?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Tasmania has been having their say on this project for three years now, and they will have their say through the voices of this parliament. It does not matter what we do, what we say, what we produce -

Dr Woodruff - What is the point of the consultation process?

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens, what is the point of interjecting?

Mr ROCKLIFF - We will never get the Greens to support a jobs-creating project. You will change the goalposts and you will do all sorts of things and you put all that extreme language out there in the community, but at the end of the day we know you are not going to support it, alright. We will have as much information out there in the public arena as possible, as we have always had in a transparent way.

There have been many questions in Question Time and in the scrutiny from good friends in the media, as there should be - Budget Estimates, the Public Accounts Committee and continuing today. There will be legislation drafted as a result of the submissions that people put forward, closing tomorrow, and that will inform the legislation which will be debated in this place. 

I look forward to consulting with all members of parliament. I look forward to offering and ensuring briefings for all members of parliament in both Houses so that we can have a very sensible conversation about this. That is important. We believe in this project because it will grow our economy and support job creation. For all the extremities and extreme language you might use, I believe this is a commonsense project, difficult as these kinds of stadia projects have been across the country. It is a project worth having the fight for, for all the opportunities that will be presented for the Tasmanian community. 

The process will be open and transparent, and it will enable people to be consulted; every single member of parliament will have their say and have the opportunity to exercise their vote on behalf of their constituencies.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - A supplementary question, Honourable Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary.

Mr BAYLEY - The Premier said that Tasmanians will get to have their say through us, and he said that there will be as much information as possible on the table at that time. My question was explicitly about the two reports that have not yet been released that were promised five weeks ago. Will the Premier commit to ensuring that those reports are published and made public so that we have all of the information available, not just as much as is possible?

The SPEAKER - The Premier went close to answering, but I will allow the Premier to add to that answer.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the honourable member for your question. I will need an update on those reports and I am happy to provide an update for the parliament.

The SPEAKER - Can I confirm you will provide that to the parliament today?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Yes.


Business Confidence - Government Economic Management

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.26 a.m.]
Yesterday, Roy Morgan released a nationwide business survey which showed confidence in Tasmania had collapsed. Confidence has collapsed by 17 points in Tasmania, the biggest fall in the nation. We have gone from third spot a year ago, to a situation where business confidence, to quote Roy Morgan: 'Is now clearly the lowest of any state'.

Saul Eslake says that Tasmanian finances are set to be the worst of any state or territory and the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (TCCI) says it will be hard to ever trust your government again. Building approvals are at the lowest level in eight years [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=8.6_C=0.82] , our wages are the lowest in the nation, and young people are leaving our state in record numbers. Is it any wonder that business confidence has collapsed when this is the way you are running the economy?

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=41.8_D=3.9_C=0.44]  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=46.2_D=2.0_C=0.65] Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the questio [Bookmark: Phr6_O=54.1_D=0.6_C=0.86]  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=56.4_D=0.6_C=0.35]  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=59.6_D=6.2_C=0.83] n. Tasmanians do not embrace negativity.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The fact is that you come to this place every single day - and outside as well - and talk Tasmania down. It would be nice, occasionally, to see a media statement from you welcoming some good news for once in terms of trying to at least convey a message - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left. 

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=94.5_D=29.6_C=0.75] to the Tasmanian people that you are in their corner and you embrace good news. It might give the people of Tasmania a balanced perspective -

Mr Willie - We are holding a bad government to account. 

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark.

Mr ROCKLIFF - that you are not always negative and talking Tasmania down.

Members interjecting.

Ms Dow - Biggest fall in business confidence in the country. 

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I did not see any media release from the opposition when state final demand grew 3 per cent for the December quarter compared to a year ago, topping all other states over this period.

Members interjecting.

Mr Willie - That is debt-funded public spending. 

The SPEAKER -  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=125.1_D=2.9_C=0.58] The member for Clark - if I can stop the [Bookmark: Phr12_O=128.1_D=26.7_C=0.69]  Premier. The member for Clark is warned twice. You have two in one there, Mr Willie. The Premier will address his answers through the Chair to avoid these interjections. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - The member for Clark clearly loves talking Tasmania down because you were egging on a recession. You are always egging on a recession in this place and talking Tasmania down. 
Mr Willie - That is not true. 

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark, if you wish to stay in the Chamber, I suggest you wait until your turn to ask a question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thankfully [Bookmark: Phr13_O=155.7_D=3.1_C=0.77] , investors and small-business people [Bookmark: Phr14_O=159.1_D=28.1_C=0.77]  and Tasmanians - and I saw some figures the other day about retail trade - very good. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The other members can stop covering for him. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thankfully they do not listen to you.

The SPEAKER - Through the Chair, Premier.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Honourable Speaker, they do not listen to Mr Willie, thank goodness, because despite the scare campaign and the recession that Mr Willie eggs on, we had nation-leading economic growth.

Mr Willie - Point of order. 

The SPEAKER - Premier, I will take the point of order. 

Mr WILLIE - Honourable Speaker, I have never egged  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=189.3_D=11.3_C=0.52] on a recession.

Members interjecting.

Mr WILLIE - The Premier is making statements that are completely untrue and I ask him to address the question.

The SPEAKER - [Bookmark: Phr16_O=202.0_D=21.0_C=0.87]  The point of order was about 127 and 144, potentially. I will draw the Premier to the question. Otherwise, we will have a supplementary. If members are personally offended, they can ask for the Premier to withdraw comments. 

Mr Willie - I have a thick skin. I want him to answer the question. 

The SPEAKER -  It is not a conversation, Mr Willie. You can seek to make a personal explanation afterwards if you would like as well. Would you like to take that opportunity?

Mr Willie -  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=223.7_D=9.6_C=0.64] I have a thick skin. I want the Premier to answer the question. That is the point.

The SPEAKER - The time has expired. I imagine I will hear - I am not hearing a supplementary? [Bookmark: Phr18_O=235.5_D=5.4_C=0.68]  Well, that worked very poorly. 


Heritage Tasmania Launceston Office

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=243.8_D=2.4_C=0.35] Mrs PENTLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.30 a.m.]
A decision [Bookmark: Phr20_O=249.2_D=1.0_C=0.63]  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=251.0_D=1.2_C=0.76]  [Bookmark: Phr22_O=254.0_D=25.8_C=0.72]  to move the northern office of Heritage Tasmania away from the heart of Launceston has been strongly opposed. For more than two decades the central location has served a strategic purpose, giving staff access to historic buildings they help protect and the proponents they deal with. How was this decision communicated to affected staff? Will you admit that moving them to Prospect will make it harder for them to do their jobs effectively? [Bookmark: Phr23_O=280.6_D=3.9_C=0.78]  Will you take these concerns seriously and find a dinky-di solution?

The SPEAKER -  [Bookmark: Phr24_O=288.1_D=5.3_C=0.64] I am not sure what 'dinky-di' necessarily means in the context, but I will allow the Premier to answer the question.

ANSWER
 [Bookmark: Phr25_O=296.1_D=8.4_C=0.63] 
Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question, and I am going to have to take on notice the terminology of 'dinky-di.' I am happy to come back to present to the parliament later on when I find that information out. I thank the member for the question. I have had some advocacy in this area from yourself, and the honourable Speaker has also had advocacy in this area. Members have raised a number of these issues with me.

The proposed move was seeking to provide Heritage Tasmania staff with the opportunity to co-locate with their agency colleagues and therefore have greater access to shared resources. I would never seek to diminish the ability of Heritage Tasmania staff to undertake their statutory duties. I have received communication and correspondence from, as I understand it, those directly affected. We are always open to feedback and try to address the matters that have been raised. There have been security matters that have been raised as well about the building.

Given the advocacy of yourself and others, and the number of areas raised, I have determined that we will no longer pursue the proposed move, and that Heritage Tasmania staff will remain at St John Street.


Enabling Business Grant Program

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.33 a.m.]
Despite the fact your government is driving Tasmania deep into debt, posting record budget deficits and sending business confidence down the drain, you have stood by your controversial Enabling Business Grant Program. It runs counter to principles of competitive neutrality and does not represent good value for taxpayers. It is not even being competently managed. 

Documents we have obtained through right to information requests show you provided a $10,000 grant for a solar power system to a cafe that had been closed for more than a year. This was known at the time, as the grant assessor, with a simple search of the business website, reported the business had closed for an indefinite period of time. More than six months later, it is still listed online as being indefinitely closed. When the budget is in such dire trouble, why are taxpayers funding solar systems for businesses that have been closed for years?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. We are always willing to support businesses to thrive and grow. The Minister for Hospitality and the Small Business remains at arm's length from the grant process, which is important.

In terms of the matter that you have raised specifically, I will ensure that we will get information for you.

When it comes to cafes and others, I was pleased to be with Hamlet Cafe this morning, offering them more certainty. In terms of Earthwater Cafe, I am advised that whilst this business is not currently operating as a cafe, given the rising operational costs for that particular component of the business -

Ms Finlay - Power prices.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Sorry?

Ms Finlay - Power prices.

The SPEAKER - Sorry, we are not having a conversation across the Chamber.

Mr ROCKLIFF - However, it is still operating as a commercial kitchen, in true Tasmanian style. I commend all our small businesses. Through the pandemic, as an example, many small businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector, really had to pivot overnight. I know of some businesses in northern Tasmania that had to close their doors, but then provided a takeaway service, for example. They really had to be innovative in their approach -

Mr Willie - We are not in COVID anymore. That is the point. 

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark, you need to stop. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - In true Tasmanian style, they have pivoted this business, as I am informed, and diversified to produce commercial products in their kitchen, including canned and jarred goods in addition to local free-range eggs and fresh produce, with plans to further expand these offerings soon. The grant provided is enabling them to improve profitability and their long-term sustainability through allowing the efficient scaling up of production with additional product lines and reduced energy costs.

Acceptable evidence was provided within the application to demonstrate an ongoing business venture was in operation. The honourable member has come in with a 'gotcha' moment today and has got free-range egg all over his face.

The SPEAKER - Your time for answering the question has expired. Premier, you may have more material, but you may sit down now.


Commission of Inquiry - Rights of Children and Young People

Ms ROSOL question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.38 a.m.]
Given the findings of the commission of inquiry, will you commit to not introducing any laws that violate the rights of children and young people?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. Ms Rosol, I appreciate your passion and the deep commitment you have in this area, and I thank you for that. I understand there is a matter of public importance today. The rights of the child are paramount and will always be so, and we take the recommendations of the commission of inquiry very seriously.

We are committed to implementation. An example of that is the matter concerning the Pontville facility. Minister Jaensch outlined that investment on Monday and we look forward to that starting as soon as we possibly can, to ensure that people who attend that facility for various reasons leave that facility being very productive members of our community. That must always be the aim, and never giving up on anyone must be the aim. To your question, I am not sure if you have any specific examples of concern but the rights of the child are paramount in all circumstances.

Supplementary Question

Ms Rosol - A supplementary question, Speaker? 

The SPEAKER - I will take the supplementary question.

Ms ROSOL - I thank the Premier for his answer. Just to be clear, can the Premier confirm that he will commit to not introducing laws that violate the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child?

The SPEAKER - That probably does arise from the answer that the Premier gave.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I will just point to my previous answer. The matters coming from the question are probably the matters that have been concerning Tasmanians, some more locally and other areas around Tasmania more recently. We do have to have a comprehensive policy when it comes to these areas. We have mentioned being tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime, and we need to be, to ensure the community is confident and feels safe. As difficult as it may be to engage in that side of the conversation for the Greens, we have to engage in that side of the conversation in terms of keeping people safe in their communities.

It is not good enough that people do not feel safe in going to do their shopping, for example.

Ms ROSOL - Point of order, Standing Order 45, relevance. I am asking specifically about the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.
Enabling Business Grant Program

Mr WILLIE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.41 a.m.]
The point of these questions is that the government has a COVID hangover and you cannot manage the budget. The Department of State Growth says that the Enabling Business Grant Program -

Mr Ellis - You are needing to explain yourself today.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Mr Ellis.

Mr WILLIE - I will start again.

The SPEAKER - Your time is not starting again, but go.

Mr WILLIE - The Department of State Growth says the Enabling Business Grant Program aims to support Tasmania's small businesses to grow, adapt and innovate by providing taxpayer-funded grants for technology or other enabling purchases. The information obtained by the Labor Party shows grants were provided for glass cabinets in newsagencies, trailers for maintenance businesses and freezers in grocers. Why are taxpayers funding these things in a budget crisis and how do you think any of these things fit with the program's supposed focus on supporting small business with technology investments? 

ANSWER 

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question and I take that as a slight on small business.

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - What sort of government is this?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Over 90 per cent of Tasmanians are employed in the small business community. We are a government that supports small business. We are a government that, for example, supports all businesses in the tourism industry. Nothing ceases to amaze me when it comes to the Labor Party and their commentary on certain matters, but when you suggested that tourism marketing is 'puff and promotion', I just had to shake my head.

Members interjecting.

Mr Willie - That is not what I said.

Mr Winter - He did not say that.

Mr Willie - I was quoted incorrectly. We had that debate.



———————————————————
Member Suspended

Member for Clark - Mr Willie

[10.43 a.m.]
The SPEAKER - The member for Clark will now remove himself under Standing Order 149. You have had multiple chances to behave -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - People who find it funny on the other side - Mr Ellis will be out next. The Premier will wait until the member has left the Chamber. You may return at the end of the MPI.

Mr Willie withdrew.
———————————————————
Mr ROCKLIFF - We are always wanting to invest and support small businesses and social enterprise. That is why we are a government that supports growth in our economy, because when you support growth in our economy and make key strategic investments, such as enabling infrastructure and those types of things, and support job creation and growth, you are then able to make those very key decisions of where to invest Tasmanian taxpayer money.

Those opposite have every right to detail their policy about these particular matters, but this is why, when growing our economy, we can support important social enterprises such as the Hamlet Cafe, which has supported people with barriers to employment over the last nine years. I was there today with Emily, Jim, Matt and Cam - key contributors to that organisation. Jim, a participant, mentioned the member who just left the seat. It was a great example of listening to important areas of the community and advocates. Mr O'Byrne, who has been a very strong advocate of Hamlet Cafe over a number of years, was there today. Tasmanian taxpayer funds are wisely invested in social enterprises such as Hamlet Cafe -

The SPEAKER - Premier, your time for answering the question has expired.


Integrity Commission Reforms

Mr JENNER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.45 a.m.]
If your government has the capacity to fast-track a billion-dollar stadium project with special legislation and clear timelines, why has it failed for nearly a decade to deliver long overdue integrity reforms that your own government agreed were necessary and urgent?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank Mr Jenner for his question. You have been dogged in answering the questions about the Integrity Commission and in advocating for more support and reform in this area, and for that I commend you. 
We strongly support the values and the work of the Integrity Commission, respecting the independent nature of the commission to do its work. We are mindful of your point about the Cox review, which is an example you have raised before. We are progressing implementation of the remaining recommendations made by the Cox review as well as the recommendations of the Weiss review, and commission of inquiry in relation to the Integrity Commission as soon as possible. In terms of the Cox review, 55 recommendations were received and we have accepted the majority of those recommendations in full or in principle. Six of those recommendations are now complete, addressing technical and other relatively straightforward matters.

There has already been significant work undertaken in considering the remaining recommendations and other suggested reforms, including consultation through the release of a discussion paper in 2022.

We need to continue. We are committed to continuing the work. You have highlighted the fact, Mr Jenner, that we need to press the button on these reforms and I accept that; to put the accelerator on, you will keep us accountable to that. Can I tell you we are committed to continue with those recommendations implementations.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Project of State Significance Process

Mrs BESWICK question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF 

[10.48 a.m.]
Pulse Tasmania has just broken the news that the POSS process will end if your enabling legislation fails. You have stated there will be no ongoing costs, there will be no stadium, there will be no team. Premier, why the ultimatum? Why not allow the POSS to continue in line with the will of the parliament?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. The will of the parliament will be reflected when we vote on the enabling legislation. It is very clear and I have ensured that everyone knows my view on this important enabling legislation, and indeed the reasons for it, in ensuring that this major project can proceed along the timelines. The fact is that we have got to get the job done.

The fact is if we want a team, if we want to start this project, we have got to get on with the job. Every single member of parliament will get one vote and decide whether or not they want a team.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Greens. Leader of the Opposition.

Mr ROCKLIFF - If they want that enabling infrastructure to ensure that it supports the growth in the economy for the reasons that I expressed in the previous question - 

Mr Bayley - The Collins Street bridge? 
The SPEAKER - The Deputy leader of the Greens is warned. He has been persistent today.

Mr ROCKLIFF - to ensure that that job creation happens - this is a project that has been well canvassed and well scrutinised; more than any other project in living memory. There will continue to be consultation on the project and the enabling legislation, but we have got to make a decision. The POSS process will end. It will all end if we do not get this enabling legislation through - 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left have opportunities to ask further questions.

Mr ROCKLIFF - because there are key timelines that we have to progress to ensure that we get this project done, we can get our team established and we can start that private investment coming in to support our economy.

The SPEAKER - I will take the Deputy Leader of the Greens - sorry, Deputy Leader of the Labor Party. Sorry, my apologies. 

Mr Ellis - Easy mistake.

Ms Dow - I do not think so.

The SPEAKER - Also not helpful today. You are already under my watch.


Enabling Business Grant Program

Ms DOW question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.51 a.m.]
By my account, the enabling Business Grant Program funded 14 iPads, 17 iPhones, 14 MacBooks and at least 11 other computers. It would appear at least one person received three grants under this scheme under different business names and the program even funded two pairs of noise-cancelling headphones for a custom hat business. How did this benefit the Tasmanian community and how is it a responsible use of public money in a budget crisis?

ANSWER

I am assuming you are going to cancel this program and cancel support for small business and cancel tourism marketing funding?

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - Yes. This grant fund is a joke.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Okay, you have said yes.

Members interjecting.
The SPEAKER - The Premier does not get to ask questions across the Chamber and the Leader of the Opposition is now warned. This will stop. I am not having a repeat of yesterday. Members on my right will also listen to the Premier's answer.

Mr ROCKLIFF - My understanding is that on 30 October 2024, we launched the Hospitality Business Booster Grant Program, with grants of up to $5000 available to eligible hospitality businesses. The program aimed to support small businesses operating in the Tasmanian hospitality industry to invest in activities that will attract visitors to their regions and the like. Of course, there was high demand for that. The program yielded 88 successful applicants for a range of projects, including website upgrades, marketing campaigns, or to undertake minor works at their venues to attract more customers, which is good. 

We have other programs such as the Multicultural Grants Program. The Multicultural Small Business Grant Program was opened -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark, member for Braddon, and member for Franklin will cease interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - with a commitment of $200,000 for phase one, offering grants -

Ms DOW - Point of order, Speaker. I will just draw the attention of the Premier to the question and the grant program that is in question, and relevance. He is on another program. 

The SPEAKER - I will take relevance. Premier. I will draw you to the grant program -

Ms DOW - He is on another -

The SPEAKER - Thank you, I have taken your point of order. Premier, I will draw you to the grant program that was contained in the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The Enabling Business Grants, Hospitality Business Boost and Multicultural Business Grants have all been run by the Department of State Growth with successful applicants determined by the department.

Mrs Petrusma - That is right; arm's length.

The SPEAKER - I think he knows that he is right, thank you, minister.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The grant guidelines required a registered ABN to apply. The applications were assessed by the department and successful applicants met the guidelines. The grant process was non-competitive and this is part of the simplicity of a non-competitive process. 

I also note there was no provision for the department to deep dive and cross-check if multiple businesses owned by the same individuals or companies had put in applications, et cetera, including other grant programs. The point is that applicants apply and these are grants that are supporting our small business community.

Ms DOW - Point of order, Speaker, the Premier can correct me if I am wrong, but I thought he just said then that there was a deep dive to see if there were businesses that were provided multiple grants?

The SPEAKER - That is not a point of order. You may ask a supplementary question on that.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I also note, to my knowledge, there was no provision for the department to deep dive -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

The SPEAKER - Is there a supplementary?

Ms DOW - Yes, there is a supplementary question. Why was there no deep dive into the application process to determine whether or not there were in fact applications from the same business and whether that business received more than one grant?

The SPEAKER - It does arise from the information the Premier gave in his answer and is relevant.

Mr ROCKLIFF - My understanding is that business people have more than one business, that is possible in Tasmania, and grants would go to certain businesses as they apply for them, to add value and strengthen their business capability.


'Adult Crime, Adult Time' Policies 

Ms ROSOL question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.56 a.m.]
Last week you announced your government would pursue 'adult crime, adult time' for children who engage in criminal behaviour in response to community concern. Professor Rob White, the Tasmanian Council of Social Services (TasCOSS) and other organisations criticised your announcement and pointed to the complete lack of evidence that punitive responses achieve any reduction in youth crime. On top of this, 'adult crime, adult time' stands in total contradiction of the commission of inquiry recommendations your government committed to and are a violation of the rights of children and young people. 

In your effort to look like a tough guy, you are walking away from the government's commitment to implementing the commission of inquiry recommendations. Will you step back from tough on crime, follow the evidence, be serious about implementing the commission of inquiry's recommendations, and invest in services for children and families that are proven to reduce youth crime?

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.3_D=0.9_C=0.16] Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I point to my previous answer. There was and still is a lot of fear in the community about youth crime. People do not feel safe. Therefore, I make no apologies for saying that we will look around the country to find [Bookmark: Phr4_O=62.6_D=4.5_C=0.60]  the best policies - 

Ms Rosol - Hopefully what works.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass.

Mr ROCKLIFF - that work [Bookmark: Phr5_O=67.9_D=27.2_C=0.80] . As I understand it, there is evidence that recent Queensland policies are working. We have introduced knife crime legislation in to this place, 'post and boast' into this place as well, which is also causing concern in terms of those activities in the community. It is our job as a government to respond to community concerns and keep people safe - 

Ms Rosol - And implement evidenced-based actions.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I respect your views on diversion programs because it is an important part of what is a very complex policy response to youth crime [Bookmark: Phr8_O=118.0_D=10.5_C=0.75]  concerns in the community. We need to ensure that the community is kept safe and we need to invest in programs that ensure our young people have every opportunity [Bookmark: Phr9_O=129.2_D=25.5_C=0.85]  to be productive members of our community and good citizens for our community. We cannot give up on any one individual. We will support individuals to be better citizens. That may well be a policy response about bail and other matters - which why would we not investigate? The important thing is that there is investing in [Bookmark: Phr10_O=155.6_D=6.1_C=0.57]  areas such as Youth Alcohol and Drug Service (YADS) which I understand starts up this week.

Mr Jaensch - This week.

Mr ROCKLIFF -  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=162.5_D=27.8_C=0.79] Thank you, Mr Jaensch. That and other areas as well. 

Our youth justice model of care is the first in Australia that applies to a whole youth justice service system, outlining a collaborative approach to services across government and our community service providers and Aboriginal organisations, working together in children and young people's best interest. I thank the minister, Mr Jaensch, for leading that reform because it provides a consistent, coordinated [Bookmark: Phr12_O=191.1_D=0.5_C=0.94]  policy [Bookmark: Phr13_O=192.0_D=30.0_C=0.80]  approach to delivering trauma-informed, evidence based - to your question - and culturally safe services to children and young people in contact with, or at risk of coming into contact with the youth justice system, and their families across Tasmania. It will guide agencies and community service providers in the development and implementation of youth justice policies, programs and services. I have some more information here but time is -

Macquarie Point Stadium - Compensation to Developers
 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=222.1_D=2.7_C=0.70] 
Mr GARLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.00 a.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=231.7_D=21.6_C=0.80] We know that when you signed us up to build a stadium at Macquarie Point, there was already a comprehensive master plan for Macquarie Point that did not include the stadium. We also know the Macquarie Point Development Corporation (MPDC) and/or the government had secured agreements with a number of developers and businesses to develop or operate out of that precinct. 

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=254.2_D=29.6_C=0.85] If the stadium goes ahead, many of those agreements will need to be terminated and the Macquarie Point Development Corporation will need to compensate those developers, just as it did when it paid over $1.25 million to Milieu developers. How much is the Macquarie Point Development Corporation and, ultimately, the taxpayer liable for to compensate these businesses and developers who have had, or will have, their agreements terminated to make [Bookmark: Phr17_O=283.9_D=3.9_C=0.39]  way for your stadium?

ANSWER

 [Bookmark: Phr18_O=289.8_D=1.2_C=0.20]  [Bookmark: Phr19_O=292.6_D=11.7_C=0.77] Honourable Speaker, I thank Mr Garland for his question. You raised the example of Milieu, which I believe has been worked through and sorted. I will get the information to ensure that is the case. I am not aware of others, but if there are others, I will bring that to your attention.


Enabling Business Grant Program - Audit

Ms DOW question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.01 a.m.]
The Enabling Business Grant Program has been anti-competitive and poorly run, and was another massive waste of public money in the middle of a budget crisis. You handed out money for low-tech items like glass cabinets, freezers and trailers, when the program was supposed to be about bringing new technology into small businesses. You gave our money to a custom hat maker for noise-cancelling headphones and gave one person three grants. How can you justify this in a budget crisis? 

Will you commit today to conducting a full audit of this grants program? Will you also guarantee the House that this sort of reckless spending will never occur again under your watch?


ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I note some disparaging inferences were made towards small business in the questions, and I expect an apology. 

Members interjecting.

Ms DOW - Point of order, honourable Speaker. I ask the Premier to withdraw that. We are doing our jobs, not disparaging small businesses. It is disparaging the management of this government.

The SPEAKER - Does the member claim to be personally offended?

Ms DOW - I am.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I beg your pardon, members on my right? Premier, the member claims to be personally offended by the reflection.

Ms DOW - Yes, because it is not true and it is not the intent of the question.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - You can cease the argument. If the member is personally offended you will need to explain why you were personally offended. The Premier has said that he believed the question contained disparaging remarks. I am not sure that can be a personal reflection, but I will ask the Premier to be conscious of your concerns during his answer. 

Members on my right will stop helping the Premier. I do not think he needs you right now.

Mr Abetz - It is our job.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Mr Abetz.

Ms Dow interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader, you did get your point on the record. You can cease interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I will have to check the Hansard, because the way I interpreted the question from Mr Willie, I believe - who has fled the Chamber - was that it was disparaging and incorrect when it comes to the way the question was presented.

The SPEAKER - Premier, I will draw you to the question. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - In the instance of the Enabling Small Business, Hospitality Business Boost and Multicultural grants programs, it was deemed appropriate at the time the guidelines were released to make the program non-competitive for several reasons. 

Dr Broad - So your mates can get them.

The SPEAKER - Dr Broad.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The first being - seriously? Come on, Shane - Dr Broad. The first of these was that the application process for business to apply for competitive grants requires more time from busy business owners. We are listening to businesses. That assessment process for competitive grants is also more intensive on the department. In the case of the smaller grant, values being offered would likely have led to difficult situations where many applications of the same type would be compared against one another.

It is the department that assesses the applications received at arm's length from the government and determine those who are successful, in line with the guidelines. Of course, we will examine what any future guidelines may entail to ensure a fair, streamlined approach that does not put unnecessary burden on the time of the applicants or the department administering them.

Supplementary Question

Ms DOW - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary.

Ms DOW - The question went directly to asking the Premier whether he would undertake an audit of this grants program, and he did not answer that question. 

The SPEAKER - I will draw the Premier to the original question. I will stop the clock for a second just to remind members that even by interjection, if you wish to allege corruption or substantive misbehaviour in that way, there are ways available to you to do that in the House, but it is not okay to yell those things out in the Chamber. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - The member has just had a supplementary but, really, you are attacking small business, which I am deeply concerned about. I worry about it. It is not a good look attacking business and attacking investment in marketing, which you call 'puff and promotion' when it comes to our visitor economy.

My understanding - and correct me if I am wrong - is that Mr Willie, who has had to leave the Chamber, was posing in a picture with one of his favourite locally brewed Moonah beers -

Ms DOW - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance.

The SPEAKER - I will draw the Premier to the supplementary question he was asked.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It is relevant because you are getting up and attacking small business and attacking a program -

Mr Winter - Another question not answered.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - but Mr Willie was standing up on 23 December with one of the recipients.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

Snug Ambulance Station

Mr STREET question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

[11.08 a.m.]
You recently announced the preferred site for the new ambulance station at Snug, which was a key commitment of last year's election. With the site now announced, a constituent has reached out to ask me when the new station will be built and operational. Can you please provide an update to the House?


Unwanted Cat Management

Ms BADGER question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Ms HOWLETT

My question is from my constituent Alice, who is a wildlife carer. Many people turn to Alice when they have unwanted cats or kittens. For Alice to comply with the requirements under Tasmania's Cat Management Act 2009 and surrender these cats, she must take a three-hour drive to the closest drop-off centre in Launceston, where the current wait time is six months. Alice pays all associated costs out of her own pocket. 

In the last five years, how much funding has the government provided to cat management facilities, other organisations and individuals who care for unwanted cats, strays and kittens? How many people have been penalised for the dumping or abandoning of cats and kittens under the act in the last five years? Will your 2024-2029 Cat Management Plan actually be done by 2029?


North West Regional Hospital Car Park

Ms DOW question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

My constituent from Burnie would like to know when he could get a car park at the North West Regional Hospital.


Hotel Occupancy

Mr WOOD question to MINISTER for BUSINESS, INDUSTRY and RESOURCES, Mr ABETZ

I note the Tasmanian Hospitality Association's 'Hotel Occupancy Report' for March showed robust occupancy for the accommodation sector right across the state. The high rates of occupancy are terrifically good news for Tasmania's economy, and reflect the efforts that have been put into encouraging people to visit our great state and in supporting the sector. 

In March 2025, almost 90 per cent of all hotel rooms across Tasmania were full. This is a fantastic result. Do you have any further information about this occupancy data, and are you able to provide further information about how the hospitality industry is doing in my electorate of Bass?


Birralee Road Reconstruction

Ms BUTLER question to MINISTER for INFRASTRUCTURE, Mr VINCENT

Peter from Westbury asked when the next section of the western Birralee Road will be reconstructed, and when the reconstruction of the whole of Birralee Road will be completed. Is there funding allocated for the completion of the next section and the whole of the road? Two people have lost their lives on Birralee Road since 2018. When Peter raised concerns about that section with State Growth in 2018, he was told that significant stabilisation, patching and sealing was undertaken on the section of the road. It was terrible then, and even worse now. It requires a complete rebuild, not further repatching.

Despite the poor condition, Birralee Road was approved for B-double use and categorised as category 2, Tasmania's major regional road for carrying heavy freight. It was later assessed as substandard in terms of width for intended operation as 26M, B-double and freight route by a highly qualified and experienced traffic engineer. What Austar rating is the completed section rated, and will the rest of the reconstruction be category 3 or better?

The SPEAKER - The member's time for asking the question has expired.

MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Rights of Children and Young People

[11.13 a.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House take note of the following matter: rights of children and young people.

We know that in the past in Tasmania, the rights of children and young people have been violated. The commission of inquiry was very clear on this and starkly laid it all out. They found that practices in Ashley Youth Detention Centre, including the use of excessive force in detention and the use of solitary confinement, violate this convention. They also emphasise that detaining a child should be a measure of last resort and when a child is detained, the detention should be for the shortest appropriate time, which is Article 37 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child.

The commission of inquiry argued that all children in Australia, including Tasmania, should enjoy the rights contained in the convention, and the 191 recommendations that they made were aimed at fixing the situation, making sure Tasmania never goes there again in terms of violating children's rights. Yet here we are, with the government flagging their plans to introduce laws that are widely recognised as a violation of human rights. The proposed 'adult crime, adult time' laws violate international human rights law. Multiple organisations have raised that and pointed out that the proposal is based on Queensland's laws. After Tasmania, which has the dubious honour of having the highest rate of youth offenders proceeded against out of any state and territory, Queensland has the second highest rate.
According to ABS youth recidivism data obtained by the ABC, Queensland and Tasmania have the equal second worst youth recidivism rate, just behind the Northern Territory. The relevance of this is that tough on crime does not work. We already have significant rates of youth offenders being preceded against and significant rates of recidivism, and the actions we are taking now are not working. There is no way that 'adult crime, adult time' will fix this situation.

On top of that, the Human Rights Law Centre has noted that the Queensland laws are incompatible with multiple international obligations. The Convention of the Rights of the Child, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination - I could go on. There is a long list of international obligations that tough on crime, 'adult crime, adult time' laws are in violation of.

When Queensland introduced their laws, multiple organisations spoke out against them and highlighted these violations: the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, Amnesty International, Save the Children, the Queensland Human Rights Commission Chair, the Uniting Church of Australia and Mission Australia. It is widely accepted that tough on crime is a violation of the human rights of children in Australia and in Tasmania, if that is what the government plans to do here.

Yes, there is community concern about youth crime; yes, we do need to address the issue. However, the answer is not to introduce laws that violate the human rights of children. Let us be clear: tough-on-crime laws that have been signalled for introduction by the Premier are in direct contradiction to the recommendations of the commission of inquiry and they are a violation of the rights of children and young people. There is a wealth of evidence available about what works to reduce youth crime and what also [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=29.9_C=0.87]  respects the rights of children and young people. It is not as if we do not know what works.

We have living in Tasmanian some of those experts who have helped in identifying best practice. They are speaking out on this and I am referring to you, Professor Rob White, as one of the people, but there are others as well. There are many ways we can respond to the issue of youth crime in Tasmania. Locking them up more is not the right way. It will not [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.7_D=28.1_C=0.90]  work. It violates their rights and the government must implement policies and legislation that follow the evidence. It is not acceptable to present a tough approach that is not evidence-based and will cause harm to children in Tasmania. 

The Greens call on the government to listen to the evidence, to do the right thing, to walk away from their tough-on-crime laws and [Bookmark: Phr4_O=89.6_D=1.6_C=0.89]  implement evidence-based approaches.

[11.18 p.m.]
 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=92.2_D=2.2_C=0.52]  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=96.4_D=25.5_C=0.84] Mr JAENSCH (Braddon - Minister for Children and Youth) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for bringing on this matter today. This government has a very strong track record in terms of upholding the rights and the wellbeing and the voice of children and young people in Tasmania. It was this government that introduced a child and youth wellbeing framework and strategy, an independent Commissioner for Children and Young People, a Custodial Inspector with independent powers [Bookmark: Phr7_O=123.0_D=6.6_C=0.75] , and it is soon to implement a new Commission for Children and Young People as an independent statutory [Bookmark: Phr8_O=130.2_D=28.7_C=0.85]  body.

We developed and delivered a Child and Youth Safe Organisations Framework, a safeguarding framework for children in all schools. We delivered the Strong Families Safe Kids Child Safety redesign, which introduced the Advice and Referral Line to provide help for anyone concerned about the welfare of a child, even their own. It is not just a place to report others. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=159.2_D=28.3_C=0.85]  We introduced the intensive Family Engagement Scheme and the family restoration service as well. 

We have reduced the number of young people needing to be in out-of-home care and increased the number of families and the proportion of families who are supported by these safe places for their kids. We are increasing and extending care to young people who are ageing out of out-of-home care and ensuring that they have support for their transition to independence. We are also assuring access to staff [Bookmark: Phr10_O=188.8_D=4.0_C=0.76]  in terms of their education, training opportunities [Bookmark: Phr11_O=193.6_D=29.6_C=0.86] , driving lessons and other matters that assist them to become living independently in the community, exercising their rights to be citizens in Tasmania as well. 

We initiated the commission of inquiry and have committed to all 191 recommendations. We have developed a Youth Justice Blueprint and a model of care to guide every next step that is taken in terms of youth justice in Tasmania.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=223.4_D=28.1_C=0.89] As the Premier has said, we must keep Tasmanians safe in their communities. Every Tasmanian has a right to be safe where they live and going about their normal daily lives. We need to ensure that where young people are involved in offending that we are keeping the community safe through having appropriate resourcing and tools available for our police service as well as our courts. [Bookmark: Phr13_O=252.4_D=7.2_C=0.86]  What happens with the young people who are intercepted with their offending is a different matter, and that is guided by our Youth Justice Blueprint [Bookmark: Phr14_O=259.9_D=10.1_C=0.84]  which has a child-centred and rights-based approach to build a nation-leading best-practice approach to children and young people in conflict with the law.

 [Bookmark: Phr15_O=270.6_D=29.4_C=0.87] Our goal is to reduce the involvement of children and young people in the youth justice system through fewer children and young people entering the system in the first place, minimising the amount of time children and young people are in the youth justice system, and ensuring that fewer children and young people are re-entering the youth justice system. Using a public health approach, the blueprint has a focus on strengthening supports for children, young people and their families through an integrated and [Bookmark: Phr16_O=300.3_D=4.7_C=0.74]  multi-disciplinary service system that promotes wellbeing and reduces engagement in antisocial and youth offending behaviours. This is the blueprint that has informed the design of the new youth justice facility, the master plan for which I released this week and a briefing which will be held for members today. I look forward to seeing you there. We complement that with increased investment in youth diversion programs, more options for police and for magistrates regarding the first decisions that are made on a young person's first contact with the youth justice system and, as I said before, through care and support for young people exiting our youth justice system to prevent or reduce their reoffending.

As Mr Ellis has said, a small number of offenders are responsible for a large proportion of the offending in Tasmania. We need to focus on doing more and better for them, and for the communities that they live in and will return to. We need to keep looking at what works in Tasmania and around the world. We need to keep informing our blueprints and our models of care and considering what complementary laws and innovations may work here to keep our communities safe and deliver better outcomes for young people.

If we have got young people who are offending, entering our youth justice system and going around and around in that cycle, we are not doing the best by them or the community. We are committed to doing more and better for both.

Time expired.

[11.23 a.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this MPI from the member for Bass; it is an incredibly important one. The truth is that Tasmania's youth justice system has been failing young people for a very long time now. The majority of young people who do end up in the youth justice system have had a background in child protection or in out-of-home care.

Invariably they have been subjected to all kinds of trauma that has in time led to their offending behaviour. They have been let down a lot earlier than when they come into contact with the justice system. They have been let down in the education system, they have been let down by their families and loved ones, and they have been let down by the child protection and out-of-home care system. As I said on the MPI yesterday, the other indication that we have that our youth justice system is failing terribly is that a great number of young people who spend time at Ashley Youth Detention Centre, in the youth justice system, end up spending time at Risdon Prison later on in life.

If we had a youth justice system that was working, people would not end up graduating, for want of a better word, from the youth justice system to the adult justice system. How did we get here? We got here by this government continuously cutting funding to programs that did actually have good results for young people, who were early in their interactions with the youth justice system.

I will give you some examples. Not long after coming to government, in 2015, which was one year into their government, the government decided to scrap funding to a program that was called the U-Turn program, which was a program to steer young people away from a life of crime. This is reading from a police media release at the time:

… aim to steer young people away from a life of crime since its inception about 10 years ago.

…

…Unfortunately, during these restrictive budgetary times, everything is being reviewed. Regrettable, but necessary, decisions must be made to ensure this Department manages responsibly within its budget allocation with the primary focus being on delivery of frontline policing…

There is no argument that frontline policing needs to be funded, but by defunding something like Project U-Turn, an innovative program that gave young people who had been involved with car theft training in automotive systems and returned cars to victims of crime, we really have seen a deterioration in the offerings that the government is giving to young people to actually get them off the life of crime and onto making better decisions.

Just this week members would have received a letter from the Tasmanian Bike Collective. That is a program that does still operate, albeit on very restricted funding, and they support 80 young people every week, who are beginning or are already disengaged from education. That is one of the earliest indicators of future anti-social behaviour, the bike collective tells members of parliament.

The Bike Collective has written to members of parliament to explain the work that they do in assisting young people who are early in their interactions with the justice system, and the outstanding outcomes that they are able to achieve by working with those young people in an early-intervention way to stop them from getting further down the path of offending. Their call to action is that the government increases funding to their program and programs like it, and stops cutting funding to preventative programs that could actually make a significant difference to the lives of young people.

What is the outcome of making a difference to the lives of young people through programs like this? It is safer communities. It does mean less crime. It does mean safer places to live and work and enjoy recreational activities across Tasmania.

The government, in making its announcements about the closure of Ashley - and I did go to this on my contribution yesterday - has dragged its feet. While it is pulling out all stops in other areas of government, it is dragging its feet to close Ashley, a commitment that was made in 2021 by the former premier, Peter Gutwein. It has failed to stick to its time frame that was committed to by Mr Gutwein. It has failed to take heed of the commission of inquiry, which said Ashley needs to be closed as soon as possible; 2028 is not as soon as possible.

There are real doubts about whether this minister and this government is going to be able to deliver on the promise that it has already significantly delayed. The longer it delays it, the worse the outcomes for young people and the worse the outcomes for safer communities across Tasmania.

[11.28 a.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, it is unfathomable that Tasmania is in a position where the government is planning to have a stadium built at Mac Point before Ashley is closed. Not only should Tasmania's kids be able to play or watch a game of football, they should be able to get the education that they need to go into tertiary studies, whether at TAFE or at university. They should be able to live in a happy home environment free from violence and abuse. They should be able to pursue their dream career in Tasmania and not be forced to leave to the mainland to find work, or if they choose to, they can come back here and have a thriving life, a well-paying job and easily find a house. 

When youth do not have the support systems around them, when there is a huge amount of intergenerational debt in this state - let us not forget the exponentially growing number of young people suffering climate anxiety as they inherit a less and less liveable planet - we will see lost young people who are acting out and being antisocial. What is this government doing to support young people and keep them away from the youth justice system?

What Mr Jaensch said is absolutely fine, but it is contrary to the actions that we are seeing and the pursuits from the police minister and the Premier and this Liberal government's present investment priorities. While the government points to the Youth Justice Blueprint 2024-2034 as its mechanism for the prevention of crime as well as early intervention and diversion, when it comes to children and young people, its rhetoric is not matched by the statistics. What the statistics do tell us is that fewer and fewer Tasmanian children and young people are being diverted away from the criminal justice system.

The 2025 Productivity Commission Report on Government Services shows the proportion of youth offenders who are streamed into diversionary programs. Under this government, the proportion of these youth offenders subject to diversion has declined virtually every year from 54.4 per cent in 2014-15 to 35.6 per cent in 2023-24. These statistics will not be helped by the current tranche of increased police powers being brought on by the Liberals.

As we saw with knife crime, with wanding, with the hooning bill, which had very little to do with hooning, we have a government using the same rhetoric of other conservative colleagues in other states talking about 'adult time for adult crime'. They claim that the expansion of police powers and harsher penalties will reduce crime, despite the overwhelming evidence that this heavy-handed approach does not act as a desired deterrent. This approach is deeply flawed and it will not reduce crime. It will not make our community safer. What it will do is cause a lifetime of harm to Tasmania's children and young people. This is what was laid out in the Commission of Inquiry into the Tasmanian Government's Response to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings.

I note the serious concerns that have been raised over 'adult time for adult crime' in Queensland from international agencies over the possible breaches of youth and human rights under the UN Convention.

The Premier said in Question Time this morning we must be tough on the matter of youth crime, tough on crime, but what about tough on prevention? If we do want to reduce crime, we need far greater resourcing directed into dealing with the underlying causes of crime. We need more funding for education, including putting in place programs to lift our literacy and numeracy rates and our digital literacy as well. We need to provide more jobs and training and more equitably accessible training courses. We need more affordable housing and safe home environments. Surely, a bigger priority than 'adult time for adult crime' is the long-touted review of Tasmania's Family Violence Act 2004.

We need more investment into community-based services to support people with underlying needs contributing to criminal behaviour such as unaddressed mental health issues, alcohol/other drug uses and homelessness. We have systemic, intergenerational issues in this state which are not new, but they are also no closer to being resolved. They are complex issues and we acknowledge that. As parts of our community are not feeling safe because of some of the actions that we are seeing from a small group of young people, it is no wonder when evidence-based diversion programs are not being properly invested in in this state. We cannot just sweep all the social issues that are going on under the turf at Mac Point. We actually have to see the Liberals step up and lead and deal with them head-on as a priority. We must see the investment into essential services and social needs of Tasmania's youth, as per evidence base.

[11.33 a.m.]
Mr FAIRS (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, across government, we are in the process of implementing youth justice reforms in Tasmania that will fundamentally transform our approach to addressing offending behaviour by children and young people through a comprehensive, integrated and therapeutic approach that prioritises the rights of children and young people.
We are committed to both redesigning our youth justice system to provide for better outcomes for young people and to ensuring safe communities where individuals and families can go about their daily lives without the fear of encountering violence or threats.

In December 2023, the Tasmanian government released the Youth Justice Blueprint 2024-2034, which has a specific focus on early intervention, prevention and rehabilitation. A key principle of the blueprint is that children and young people have their rights upheld. We take the rights and best interests of the child or young person and their family into account in all matters relating to them. We actively engage with and seek the views of children, young people and their communities and provide ongoing opportunities for children and young people with lived experience to be heard. It provides a whole-of-government, whole-of-community plan outlining a multidisciplinary service response that promotes the involvement of all Tasmanians in supporting children and young people, to prevent them from being involved with the youth justice system.

In line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, this work will promote and protect the rights, wellbeing and best interests of children and young people in Tasmania. The blueprint also includes an increased focus on self-determination of Aboriginal people. The views of Aboriginal children and young people will be critical in delivering meaningful change in line with article 19 of the United Nations Declaration of Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

Using a public health approach, the blueprint has a focus on strengthening supports for children, young people and their families through an integrated and multidisciplinary service system that promotes wellbeing and reduces engagement in antisocial and youth offending behaviours. The result will be a service system that supports early intervention and diverts children and young people away from the statutory youth justice system. For those children and young people whose offending behaviour has escalated and involves a criminal justice response, the blueprint outlines an evidence-based therapeutic criminal justice approach that supports the young person to address the factors that led to their offending, preventing continued offending behaviours and ongoing involvement with the system.

It is through this holistic approach that we can address the root cause of youth offending while also ensuring the safety of the broader community. The blueprint will achieve whole-of-system reform by shifting the focus from tertiary responses to early intervention, prevention and diversion, with therapeutic responses being key. Through our focus on intervention and diversion, we aim to reduce the number of children and young people in the youth justice system by providing a range of services to support children and young people that are developmentally appropriate and that identify and address underlying causes and consequences of their offending.

As part of a therapeutic approach to youth justice, a strong focus on trauma-informed practice is required when children and young people experience adverse childhood events such as abuse, neglect, witnessing family violence, insecure attachment, death of a parent, not having a developmental needs met, exposure to drugs and alcohol, and caregivers with mental health issues. This can change the way their brains develop.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=16.8_D=24.9_C=0.85] We need to work with the children and young people in ways that acknowledge their experiences, understand their responses and triggers, and offer opportunities to learn new responses and behaviours, establishing new neural pathways. Children's rights must also be upheld, and it has been demonstrated that the implementation of a child-centred and rights-based approach can create positive change for children and young people in the youth justice system.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=42.5_D=6.4_C=0.72] Diversion away from the youth justice system is recognised as a key principle of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child [Bookmark: Phr4_O=49.5_D=5.9_C=0.90]  and the United Nations standard minimum rules for the administration of juvenile justice; the Beijing rules. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=56.2_D=24.6_C=0.78]  Diversionary processes provide pathways through which children and young people who have committed offences can be directed away from further involvement in the justice system. Diversionary processes have been shown to be effective for children and young people with offending behaviour, especially when these processes are accompanied by or provide a service, a system response that addresses the underlying drivers of the child or young person's offending behaviour. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=81.8_D=8.8_C=0.63]  The reform takes time. There are a number of moving parts. It needs to be a considered approach.

[11.38 a.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) -  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=92.1_D=24.4_C=0.87] Honourable Speaker, the Greens brought on this matter of public importance today because we are deeply concerned with what appears to be a disconnect between government ministers, in terms of the policies they are rolling out to protect children and young people in Tasmania, and members in the Chamber who were here during the process of the commission of inquiry and who [Bookmark: Phr8_O=117.1_D=3.1_C=0.75]  observed the hearings [Bookmark: Phr9_O=120.8_D=29.4_C=0.78] . We understood the failures that had occurred with our state agencies, our institutions, our regulatory bodies. 

We were there. I believe other members are in the Chamber who might have been there on the final days of the commission's hearing when they made their final report. They will understand that the Premier, Jeremy Rockliff, made a heartfelt commitment [Bookmark: Phr10_O=150.7_D=28.6_C=0.84]  following the words, stories, recommendations and findings of the commission of inquiry to make sure that going forward, government policies would be fully focused on keeping children and young people protected.

I believe the government has broadly followed through on a number of areas that the commission of inquiry made recommendations on [Bookmark: Phr11_O=179.8_D=22.3_C=0.76] , but what we are so concerned about is the devastating lack of urgency that has been displayed, notwithstanding the work that I know minister Jaensch is doing, on bringing to a close the Ashley Youth Detention Centre. There has been no urgency in bringing into place real, effective, therapeutic [Bookmark: Phr12_O=203.9_D=5.0_C=0.75]  support, and programs and pathways [Bookmark: Phr13_O=209.4_D=13.9_C=0.83]  for young people who are offenders to take them on a different path and to support them out of a path of crime. 

We are seeing an increase in crime in some parts of Tasmania [Bookmark: Phr14_O=225.1_D=13.3_C=0.82] , which we have to say is a matter of record, being overblown by the government and being used, we believe, as a populist measure. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=238.8_D=14.5_C=0.86]  Instead of sincerely responding to those communities with effective strategies for reducing crime in their community, it is being used, like Liberal governments have done many times, and Labor is not immune from this; they have also used this tactic [Bookmark: Phr16_O=253.7_D=29.7_C=0.89]  to signal to the community that they are taking strong action to prevent crime, when actually they are failing to do what all the evidence shows is required to reduce crime. 

They are failing to support the children who are victims in this in their own way, because of trauma and circumstances in their life which mean they are choosing to take part in these activities or being coerced [Bookmark: Phr17_O=283.6_D=21.4_C=0.85]  or as part of group pressure into being involved in activities, when there is no doubt that children of the age of 11 are not consciously capable of making decisions about their actions. They obviously need support and there obviously needs to be programs. We have these incredible parallel-world conversations going on with the Minister for Children and Young People and the Police minister.

We have a Premier who is meant to be leading the ship, who promised Tasmanians he was a premier with heart. He promised us that he would fulfil not just the recommendations, but the spirit of the commission of inquiry, and that is what is missing here.

When Ms Rosol asked this morning whether the Premier would uphold the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, he did not give an answer. He did not say yes. That is the only answer he should have given. That is the only answer that the commissioners and the people who presented to the commission of inquiry, who wanted change and who wanted us to never go back to the way we have been, wanted - and he did not say it.

That is why the Greens are so concerned. We stand with communities, we stand with community organisations, the legal experts, the children and young people experts, the children's commissioner - all the people in Tasmania and around the world who know that the tough-on-crime policies that are being rolled out in Tasmania at the moment will bring harm to children and will not make the community safer. That is the bottom line. We want to make the community safe, we want to look after children, and the Premier has to take charge.

MOTION

Macquarie Point Stadium and Tasmanian AFL Team

[11.43 a.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, a vote will be required. I move -

That the House -

(1)	Acknowledges: -

(a)	the unprecedented public interest and community concern surrounding the proposed Macquarie Point Multipurpose Stadium ("the Stadium");

(b)	the potential far-reaching impact the Stadium will have on the State's economy;

(c)	the importance of public scrutiny and trust in Government decision-making for large-scale developments affecting public land, urban planning, and future state budgets; and

(d)	that the Macquarie Point Multipurpose Stadium Integrated Assessment by the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) provides this public scrutiny and a level of democratic participation.

(2)	Notes: -

(a)	the broad public support for a Tasmanian team in the Australian Football League (AFL); and

(b)	the division within the Tasmanian community regarding the necessity, location, and economic justification for the Stadium.

(3)	Recognises that a development of this significance for the State should have broad-based community support and consent from a majority of Tasmanians.

(4)	Calls on the State Government to introduce legislation to enable a referendum on the location of the Stadium, to be held within eight weeks of the release of the TPC Final Integrated Assessment Report. 

I look at this parliament and I see a broken system. I look over at the Labor Party, and I see a party with an incoherent position on the stadium: supporting the stadium, whatever the price, however impossible the task, but in the same breath, claiming they will hold the government to account and scrutinise the stadium. Scrutiny means little when you have already locked in your support. That is not oversight; that is theatre. It is like a judge promising a fair trial after announcing the verdict. 

Then I look across at the Liberal Party, and I see a Premier who will do literally anything to get this project done - a bit like a modern-day pharaoh - and his party falling in behind him. Both major parties have committed to supporting this stadium, despite mounting public opposition and an ever-growing pile of independent reports highlighting critical flaws. When both major parties turn a blind eye to the evidence, the facts and the people, that is precisely when you need a referendum.

Back in 1912, Theodore Roosevelt said:

I believe in the referendum, which should be used not to destroy representative government, but to correct it whenever it becomes misrepresentative.

In a democracy, which gets its authority and legitimacy from the people, the question should not be, 'Why let the people vote on this issue?' The question the parties in this debate need to answer is, 'Why shouldn't the people get to vote on this issue?'

Whether you are for or against the stadium, giving the people a vote on a project of this magnitude and significance is critical, and if the Premier had done that at the start, we would not be in this mess. However, it is not too late to give them a say. I have heard the Premier say this project is in the best interests of Tasmanians, but I think the best judges of Tasmania's best interests are Tasmanians themselves. That is why I want to give them a vote, because this Premier is treating the people of Tasmania like subjects, not citizens, and this must change.

The people of Tasmania, especially in the north, feel ignored and taken for granted. Why would they not, when their elected representatives are not even raising their concerns about the stadium in this parliament? I have heard nothing from Dr Broad about how unpopular the stadium is in his electorate, nothing from Ms Dow, nothing from Ms Finlay or Mr Wood. Voters are simply not being giving a voice in this parliament or in this debate. Why not ask the people of Tasmania, 'Do you support a stadium being built at Macquarie Point?'

I am not the first MP to put forward a motion in this House calling for a referendum on the Macquarie Point stadium. On 26 October 2022, then Labor leader Rebecca White moved a motion calling for a referendum. I want to read from parts of her speech - noting the irony:

As a democratic institution, this parliament should be empowering the voices of the community, particularly around decisions on big issues like this one. If the government tests the numbers on this, it will soon understand the community does not want a $750 million stadium in Hobart. The Labor Party has been listening to the community. We hear what they tell us. They tell us they want the government to focus on getting the basics right. They tell us the government is failing to deliver for them and is obsessed by a stadium.

The only way the government will be stopped from progressing with this proposal is for there to be a referendum. What is wrong with asking the community how they feel before the government signs a blank cheque? The cost of a referendum would be equivalent to about 0.5 per cent of the total cost of building a stadium. That is a small price to pay, before the government allocates hundreds of millions of dollars to a project we do not believe is necessary.

We know that Tasmanians deserve their own team, but the Tasmanian community has never been asked whether they agree with spending $750 million on a stadium in Hobart, particularly when we have two stadiums in the state, one in the north and one in the south, that already host quality AFL content.

This is not a north and south thing. I argue that it is Tasmanians right across the state - no matter their age, no matter their background, no matter their gender - Tasmanians overwhelmingly do not support this stadium. The government is being ignorant or deaf to that and they are simply not listening. Also, I want to quote Dr Shane Broad from that same debate:

If you get a referendum it will be a resounding victory and the end of the stadium. It's fairly simple.

Ask what has changed? Does Dr Broad still believe that? Is that why Labor will not support a referendum anymore?

In this House, as an independent, debate on my motions is limited to an hour. I know from past experience this means I will not get to sum up or to reply to other contributions like the major parties do, so I am going to use the rest of my contribution to respond to what are likely to be the arguments against holding a referendum.

(1) Referendums are divisive: That argument does not hold here. The community is already deeply divided. In fact, a referendum might do the opposite. It could provide a decisive outcome, a clear mandate and allow us all to move forward together. This is what happens when people vote in Australia. They accept the result and get on with their lives.

(2) The Parliament will vote on this: The Premier repeatedly assures us that parliament will have the final say on this, and that would be democratic if major parties allowed their members a conscience vote, but that is not how it works. The Premier signed us up to a stadium with no mandate, with no advice and without the approval even of his Cabinet. This is a captain's call and Dean Winter is following in his footsteps. So yes, Mr Abetz, 50 MPs will vote on the stadium but we already know what 30 of them will say and it will not reflect the will of the people. It might not even reflect the will of the members. This is not democracy.

(3) The POSS Process: The government says the public will get their say through the POSS process. That is true if the POSS process runs to completion; but how many voters even know about the process, let alone how to make a formal submission on the stadium to the TPC panel? 1 per cent? We have compulsory voting in this country. That is why our democracy is healthier than most. It gives quiet Australians a voice. The less than 1 per cent of voters who provide a submission to the POSS process will not be representative of how Tasmanians feel about this project. What the government is doing to the POSS process is a perversion. It invites representations from the public while at the same time introducing legislation to prevent the TPC panel from considering and reporting on the hundreds of representations it receives. Instead, it will be incumbent on MPs to sift through the hundreds of representations in addition to the 1000 pages of reports to determine where voters in their electorate stand on this project. That is not democracy. That is tick-a-box consultation, something this government is adept at.

(4) We already know what the public thinks: Some MPs will say we do not need a referendum to tell us that the majority of the public is opposed to the stadium. We know that already. If the major parties truly understand that, then why will they not accept the will of the majority and act accordingly? There can only be two explanations: either the major parties do not know what the people think, they have become stuck in their echo chambers; or they do not care. I say, consult the people, give them a vote. Let us find out what they think. Then MPs can vote on this project with a clear understanding of public support in their electorates. If Tasmanians vote yes, we unite and support the project, just like we accept election results, but if, as Dr Broad and I expect, the majority vote no, then the government must return to the AFL and renegotiate. A referendum provides democratic legitimacy. It is what the Premier should have done right from the start. If the government and Labor lack the courage to stand up to the AFL, the people of Tasmania will. When the AFL sees how unpopular this stadium is in a state that has given so much to its national competition, the pressure will be on them to renegotiate in good faith. If they take our licence away, that is on them.

(5) No stadium, no team: The Premier and other stadium sycophants say if you want a team, you must support the stadium, no matter the cost or complications. That makes our state look desperate and pathetic. This is a reckless approach to a billion-dollar infrastructure project, especially at a time of record state debt. The idea that opposing the stadium means opposing the team is intellectually dishonest. It is a false binary that Tasmanians see through. There are thousands of Tasmanians who support the team but are not prepared to support a stadium at any cost. They should not have to wait three more years to have their say. By then it will be too late.

(6) Enabling legislation will override the referendum: Some MPs might say, 'What is the point of this referendum when the government is just going to introduce enabling legislation to approve the stadium before the referendum is held?' If this referendum motion passes, the government will have no mandate to legislate on the stadium until the POSS process and referendum are complete. By supporting this referendum you are supporting the completion of the POSS process. I remind Labor that the POSS process was something you previously supported. In a media release on 19 October 2023, their leader Rebecca White said:

Labor has supported the project entering the POSS process because it will give Tasmanians the best chance of finally getting some answers about the true costs of building this stadium. This decision is not an endorsement of the stadium. On the contrary, there are so many doubts about the engineering and financing of the stadium that this independent assessment process is the only way to get some transparency about details of the project the government has kept secret. The process will likely take up to two years to complete and will finally give Tasmanians a say on how they feel about the project.

Labor even went to the state election on a policy platform that it would not stop or pause the POSS process. Is that a broken promise?

(7) The people had their say at the last election: Mr Winter has gone on the record to say in response to my motion that the people of Tasmania have already had their say at the last election. What was Labor's position at the last election? Even Mr Winter has conceded that it was not clear. How can the last election be seen as a clear vote on the stadium when one of the major parties did not even take a clear policy on it to the election? In this place on 23 March 2023 Mr Winter said:

It is a ridiculous priority … to put that amount of money into a stadium in Hobart when we already have two great stadiums.

In May 2023, Ms White told ABC radio:

Yes, we will campaign against a stadium if elected. We will do everything we can to stop it.

By February 2024, their position had softened. They supported the POSS process and wanted to negotiate a better deal with the AFL. Ms White told ABC Mornings on 14 February that the Macquarie Point stadium would prove to be an impossible project, that it could not be built in that location for that price, and that she would not sign Tasmanians up to a blank cheque white elephant down at Macquarie Point.

Let us assume that the public understood Labor's position to be anti-stadium, and look at the composition of the parliament they elected. For the stadium: 15 of 35 is 43 per cent, with 14 Liberals and David O'Byrne, one. Against: 20 of 35 is 57 per cent, with 10 Labor members, five Greens, three Jacqui Lambie Network members, Kristie Johnston, one, and Craig Garland, one. Of 35 elected members, 20 ran against the stadium. 

The last state election was a clear rejection of the stadium that the major parties continue to ignore, and that is what is making people so angry. The major parties might have forgotten the results from the last election, but how about the federal election only days ago where the Liberals in this state experienced a violent swing against them that was three times the national average?

It is no coincidence that Lyons, Bass and Braddon, where the stadium is most unpopular recorded the largest swings. In Braddon, which is my electorate and the Premier's, the swing was five times the national trend. I believe that is the largest swing in Braddon's history, at least in federal elections. The collapse of the Liberal vote in Tasmania, particularly in the north, is the clearest message you can get that this stadium is strongly opposed by voters.

(8) We cannot justify the cost of a referendum: In response, I seek to table the letter from the Tasmanian Electoral Commissioner, dated 5 May 2025.

Leave granted, paper tabled.

Mr GARLAND - You will see a referendum would cost about $5 million, less than 0.5 per cent of the total stadium cost. This money would be well spent if it means we ultimately avoid spending $1 billion on a white elephant; Labor used to think so. The plebiscite by post and phone is just $2 million. Coincidentally, $2 million is the amount the Macquarie Point Development Corporation spent on consultants last year and less than half what they spent on consultants the year before. 

I will end with a history lesson. There are strong echoes of the Franklin Dam in this stadium saga. Both were divisive infrastructure projects sold as economic saviours, but were riven with planning problems. In 1981, a referendum on the dam was held, but it was corrupted by a misleading ballot. Many voters wrote 'No dams' on their ballot to protest the fact that they were not given an option of no dam, only a choice of locations for the dams. The referendum helped give rise to the United Tasmania Group, what we now know as the Greens. That is what happens when people feel they are not represented. I am also what happens when people feel they are not represented. 

[11.58 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Minister for Business, Industry and Resources) - Deputy Speaker, the issue the member has raised is one of those interesting philosophical questions in a democracy as to when you should or should not have a referendum, in what circumstances we can have debates about citizen-initiated referenda, et cetera. It is a great philosophical question and one that exercises the minds of those of us who live in the political world. 

However, in our democracy, people elect us not only on policy but, ultimately, for our judgment, to make decisions, which are sometimes tough decisions. Federally, when Paul Keating floated the Australian dollar, it was not a popular decision at the time but it was fundamentally important for our economic wellbeing. I think of John Howard introducing the GST. It was highly unpopular, nearly costing government. Three years later, everybody said, 'What on earth was that about?'. Then-Labor leader Kim Beazley thought he would be able to surf into office on the dissatisfaction with the GST only to find, after it was introduced, Mr Howard being re-elected with a higher majority. 

What we have to accept in these debates is  that the people we seek to serve to the very best of our ability will sometimes have a point of view and then change their point of view, or be convinced by the arguments. We can go right around Australia: Federation Square was highly unpopular. If a referendum had been held on that, it would have been stopped. Today, everybody sings its praises and says 'What a great thing'. Travelling to South Australia, the Adelaide Stadium was hugely unpopular. Now everybody sings its praises. Travelling further west to Western Australia, the Perth Stadium, similarly, was highly unpopular at the time. Now everybody sings its praises. Then, if my geography is right, we travel north-east, to Townsville. Similarly, a stadium initially unpopular is now very popular.

Therefore, we have to ask ourselves: do we want to submit anything that has a whiff of gunshot about it in the public debate to a referendum or do we exercise our judgment on particular issues and vexed issues? [Bookmark: Phr2_O=26.4_D=2.8_C=0.70] 

Mr Garland kindly [Bookmark: Phr3_O=29.8_D=23.8_C=0.79]  provided us with a history lesson in relation to the Franklin Dam. I remind him - and I suppose this is part of that history lesson - that the people of Tasmania at the federal election in 1983 overwhelmingly elected five Liberal House of Representatives members because they wanted the dam. People elsewhere [Bookmark: Phr4_O=54.9_D=14.6_C=0.68]  did not want the dam and Bob Hawke, as history will recall, defeated the Fraser government. However, in Tasmania, people wanted the dam, so what do you do in those sort of circumstances?

Mr Bayley - 40 per cent wrote 'No dams.'

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=71.3_D=3.0_C=0.14] Mr ABETZ -  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=75.3_D=27.4_C=0.81] Sorry? In 1983, I think we all recall how there were five Liberal House of Representatives members elected on the basis of supporting the dam. Allegedly, there was a referendum that was somehow confused, according to Mr Garland. With a referendum, you have to be exceptionally careful with the question being asked [Bookmark: Phr7_O=104.8_D=4.8_C=0.82] . I believe the question the member suggested was: Do you support a stadium being built at Macquarie Point? What happens if I only want a stadium built with a roof, or without a roof, or one that might be 50 metres high - in other words, lower than the Eden project the Greens championed a few years ago? [Bookmark: Phr9_O=138.3_D=2.9_C=0.68]  How do you determine [Bookmark: Phr10_O=142.0_D=18.2_C=0.84]  what the result of that referendum ought to be? To simply make it a binary 'yes' or 'no' would leave a lot of people unable to actually cast a vote. 

I also say to the member, with respect, that [Bookmark: Phr11_O=161.2_D=2.6_C=0.25]  both York Park and [Bookmark: Phr12_O=165.3_D=3.2_C=0.60]  Bellerive Oval - or Ninja Stadium, these days [Bookmark: Phr13_O=170.4_D=6.3_C=0.88]  - are not fit for purpose and cannot be retrofitted into an AFL [Bookmark: Phr14_O=177.9_D=2.3_C=0.78]  stadium and the purposes of an AFL team [Bookmark: Phr15_O=184.2_D=2.5_C=0.58] . Sure, they can use it for a visit [Bookmark: Phr16_O=187.8_D=28.1_C=0.68]  and then depart, but to have all the training and other facilities required for a football team, you need the elite facilities. 

I had the privilege some time ago of visiting Kardinia Park with the late Frank Costa and then-Geelong CEO Brian Cook. All the stuff they had around the stadium, under the seating, et cetera [Bookmark: Phr17_O=216.8_D=1.6_C=0.85] , in a huge complex [Bookmark: Phr18_O=218.9_D=5.1_C=0.54] , Bellerive and York Park, with respect, simply cannot [Bookmark: Phr19_O=226.1_D=8.4_C=0.82]  cater for.

Mr Bayley - Is that not why you are building a high-performance centre?

Mr ABETZ - If the AFL honestly thought they could run a good [Bookmark: Phr20_O=236.5_D=3.1_C=0.80]  Tasmanian team in these second-class facilities [Bookmark: Phr21_O=240.9_D=18.6_C=0.82] , why would they not support the retrofitting of one or the other facility at a lot lower cost? The simple fact is that it cannot be done. 

Further, we have the capacity in this state, [Bookmark: Phr22_O=261.7_D=10.7_C=0.72]  a great transformative opportunity, of once and for all dealing with this industrial wasteland which has been sitting there [Bookmark: Phr23_O=272.8_D=30.0_C=0.74]  for well over a decade. Labor spent $10 million trying to build a hospital there and then decided, 'No, it cannot be done.' Lots of plans. Finally, we have a plan that will work and is funded. 

Yes, the Liberals copped a pounding at the last election, especially in Tasmania but do you know who they were replaced by? The federal Labor Party,  [Bookmark: Phr24_O=302.9_D=2.0_C=0.88] which has committed $240 million to this very specific project, so you cannot really say that it was an anti-stadium vote that hit the Liberal Party because if that were the case, it was, for the electorate, out of the frying pan into the fire. By rejecting Liberals, they actually voted for the party that had given or will be giving $240 million to the stadium, so I am not sure that that argument will necessarily hold water within the community.

Mr Garland suggested that this was a white elephant and would cost a fair amount of money. Everybody has their own economic analysis and economics is not an exact science and so, you had Dr Gruen saying I think it was about 44 cents in the dollar return. We had the TPC coming up with their own figure - good luck to them - I think it was 50 something cents in the dollar, and then KPMG at 69 cents on the dollar. The Townsville Stadium, which is now seen as a huge success, was initially 21.9 cents return and so, when you have a look at some of these facilities, you can see that this sort of metric (1) is not exact, and (2) if you were to adopt that metric, we would have one hospital in Tasmania. You would not have roads -

Members interjecting.

Mr ABETZ - You would not have roads, you would not have roads around Tasmania. You would be spending that money in Sydney and Melbourne where you would get a higher return per dollar invested. The regional community, such as Tasmania, would miss out. One thing the member did not mention was - and I love this - that the Hobart City Council had their own approach to this and commissioned their own report only to be told that well over $100 million per annum would be pouring into the Hobart and wider community and economy, courtesy of the stadium being built.

Is that report right? Is Dr Gruen's report right? We can have these discussions and find out and believe what we want to believe, but what I think it does point out is that economics has never been an exact science and those who have provided reports have done so and it is for us to consider. The report from the Hobart City Council, which is the very latest, tells us that it would be a good economic investment and others who diminish the AFL stadium do not ever talk about the $360 million investment the AFL will make in local football all around Tasmania, $36 million per annum.

That is really, really good for our footy teams from Smithton and down to Huonville to the east coast. This will boost sporting involvement amongst our young people. Auskick has already seen a huge increase. Anybody who is involved in Auskick teams, be it in Kingborough, be it at Lauderdale, and I also understand elsewhere in the state and, as most law enforcement people will tell you, show me a suburb where there is a high rate of youth involvement in sport and I will show you a suburb with a low youth involvement in crime.

The social good that is never talked about in relation to the stadium is sort of sidelined, but is fundamentally important and again I say to this place that this will be a multipurpose stadium. When you develop a shopping centre or an office block, to get some sort of attraction, you do need what is called an anchor tenant. For a shopping centre you want a Woolworths or Coles or if it is a bit smaller, an IGA being an anchor tenant. Similarly, with the stadium, which is multipurpose, you would want an anchor tenant. This will be the AFL, and the AFL - welcome back, member for Clark. Good to see you.

Members interjecting.

Mr Jenner - He has been sitting there for the last half hour.

Ms Haddad - You are very friendly today. You are in a good mood.

Mr O'Byrne - Only because he has not seen Josh in a while.

Mr ABETZ - Back to the matter at hand. This is a multipurpose stadium which will facilitate concerts, cultural events, international conferences with a capacity of about 1500 people or so. There are going to be huge benefits apart from the AFL.

I agree with the member for Braddon when he says that an argument against this referendum might be that it would be divisive. I think we are mature enough as a community to discuss issues, and yes, they will divide - like they divide at election time, when we had the Voice referendum, when we had the republic referendum, and so on. It is how we conduct ourselves as a society in that difference of opinion that I think is a hallmark of Australian society. I agree with you that this suggestion or allegation that it will be divisive is not to be considered.

However, what I would say to the member is that the POSS process will continue until tomorrow, I believe, when public submissions finish - 8 May - and all that information that is gleaned will be taken by the government and considered by the government in relation to the way forward.

The government accepts that this motion has been brought forward in good faith. There is that philosophical question that I started off with: 'When do you hold a referendum? Why, in what circumstances, and for what purpose?' I simply say that governments are elected to make tough decisions, and Australian history is littered with governments making tough decisions, highly unpopular at the time, but then recognised later on as being the right decision and one that pushed the country forward.

I have every confidence that once the stadium is built, people will be asking, 'My goodness, what was that about?' and 'What a great thing it is to have an iconic gateway to our capital city replacing an industrial wasteland that has been a blot on our cityscape for well over a decade.'

I understand the motives of the honourable member, but the government, with respect, disagrees.

[12.15 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I thank the member, Mr Garland, for bringing this motion on. I absolutely acknowledge his ongoing role in the campaign to stop this folly of a stadium. It is good to have the opportunity to discuss and debate this motion. As tempting as it is to debate point-by-point all the things that the minister put in that contribution, I am really going to focus on the motion. I am very conscious about time and that there are others in this Chamber wanting to jump and have an opportunity to talk to this motion.

There is a lot to like about this motion in relation to many of the points. It is pretty straight bat analysis of many of the problems, and it lays out many of the challenges when it comes to the stadium. However, I will say at the outset that we are concerned about the notion of a plebiscite or a referendum on the location of the stadium.

We state upfront that we, in Tasmania, simply do not need a stadium, and that the stadium at Macquarie Point has been unequivocally shown, based on the evidence published thus far, that it is not in the interests of the state and the state's finances. It is not in the interests of the city and the functionality of the city, and that, no matter what level of support for that project, it simply should not go ahead because it is a bad project located in a bad situation. This referendum is about the location of the stadium. We do not believe we need a stadium at all.

Going to the motion itself, there is unprecedented public interest and community concern. We have seen that in the polling. We have heard that in the doorknocking we have all done in the context of the federal election, and the concerns are deep and wide. They are about the billion-plus dollars that this stadium would foist upon Tasmania and our capacity to pay it back. At what expense? At the expense of health, at the expense of housing, at the expense of education and other investments.

The traffic issues, the pedestrian issues, the heritage issues, the impact on the Cenotaph - under any other circumstance the Cenotaph would be sacrosanct but, in this case, it is being sacrificed on the altar of the AFL and the Premier's absolutely belligerent determination to push ahead with this stadium, in this location, no matter what the impacts. Even our cherished institutions like the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra - one of the few orchestras that have contracts with the ABC to record and broadcast - have raised their significant concerns about their future if this kind of development was to go ahead.

The far-reaching impact of the stadium on the state's economy is writ large, and the TPC's report has shown it really clearly: $1.86 billion of debt over the next 10 years; $76 million annual repayments to service that debt. That is money that would not be going to health, to housing, to education. It is a loss-making venture that returns just over 50 cents in every dollar that is invested. The cost is double the benefits, and we have seen expert after expert demonstrate and articulate that the proponent, the government and the Macquarie Point Development Corporation are overestimating the benefits and underestimating the costs.

Of course, the importance of scrutiny and trust in government decision-making is really important. Under (d) in this motion, that the Macquarie Point Stadium integrated assessment by the Planning Commission provides the public scrutiny and a level of democratic participation, I completely agree. We did not support the POSS process because it abandons the planning schemes and it abandons third-party rights of appeal, but the planning commission has stood up a credible panel and it is rolling out a credible process of engagement. I think I heard the minister say just then that they are going to abandon the POSS process as soon as tomorrow when all of the public submissions are in. That is something that it would be good for the government to confirm.

Consultation finishes tomorrow, but we do not even have all of the information on the table upon which to comment. The TPC itself has written to the Macquarie Point Development Corporation asking for two reports, including a flooding report that it promised to deliver by the end of March, which is five weeks ago. We do not even have that information and the consultation process is about to close.

The TPC process would include public hearings, but what we heard at our briefing on Monday in relation to the proposed new legislation is that instead of that, the conditions and the approval of this stadium would be worked up through private workshops, presumably with no notes and no ability for scrutiny - workshops with agencies like the Environment Protection Authority, the police, and Heritage Tasmania. As we questioned today, there is significant concern about the ministerial discretion; the ability for the minister to actually just impose conditions at their will. There is no confidence the government can do this openly and transparently, and if anyone needs convincing, they need look no further than the Spirits fiasco to see exactly how incompetent this government can be when it comes to managing big infrastructure projects.

Broad support of the Tasmanian team - we absolutely support a team. There is strong support for a team across Tasmania, including from the Greens, but the AFL deal was a dud deal that the Premier signed. He signed us up to a stadium in that location in that design, and every single dollar of cost overruns, without consulting Treasury, without consulting his own Cabinet, and without consulting the Tasmanian people. There is absolutely zero chance of renegotiation of that stadium condition provided Labor keep on signing the blank cheque for government. Why would the AFL renegotiate that agreement? What we need to do is to push back and demonstrate that the stadium will not go ahead, and that will force the AFL hand. We deserve a team. We need a team. We have long deserved a team on our own merits.

Mr Garland's point that a development of this significance should have broad community support - I completely agree, but we do not think that a plebiscite or a referendum like this is the way to demonstrate that. There are other preconditions that come first: it needs to be affordable and functional, and its impacts acceptable. It is clear that the impacts on the Cenotaph, certainly for the RSL and a whole number of returned servicepeople, do not accept that those impacts are acceptable. The only way to establish that is through a credible planning process, one that is transparent and considers all of the issues. That is all part of building social licence and community support.

When it comes to the crux of this motion calling on the state government to introduce legislation to enable a referendum on the location of the stadium to be held within eight weeks of the release of the TPC's final integrated assessment report, we Greens see numerous issues there. This is the part of the motion that we cannot support; it assumes we need a new stadium. We do not think there is a need for a new stadium. We completely reject the arguments made by the minister. He seemed to indicate that the stadium is going to be the home of the team for all of its elite training and other facilities, but we are spending an additional $60 million plus for a high performance centre in the Kingborough Municipality. He is completely off the mark there.

We have York Park. We have Bellerive. York Park has the best playing surface in the country, and both of these stadiums have had elite level AFL played in them for many years.

Close to $2 billion of debt over 10 years - this is money that should be spent on health, housing, education and the environment. Macquarie Point is the wrong place and the stadium is the wrong proposition when it comes to the kind of infrastructure that this state needs going forward. As I have touched on, there are traffic and pedestrian issues, heritage issues, flooding and evacuation issues, let alone the fact that it is a toxic site, and waste disposal has been identified as a significant issue. No matter the outcome of a referendum, it is not going to fix the fatal flaws associated with the development.
To finish up, we clearly cannot and do not trust the government in the context of a referendum. The example of the Franklin referendum has been quoted today already. We saw in that referendum that the option that many people wanted - the opportunity, which I think is similar in the context of this. This should not be about the location of the stadium. It should be about whether we have a stadium at all. That was not the question that was put to the Tasmanian people when it came to the referendum on the Franklin Dam.

We have had three referendums in Tasmania. One was on hotel closing hours in 1916, one was on casinos in 1968, and then the Franklin referendum in 1981. I could not trust - we do not trust the government to do this in a straight bat way, and that they would not just seek to orchestrate the result they are looking for.

Finally, a referendum is non-binding. It is not binding on the government. That is a significant concern.

There is a lot in this motion to support, and it lays out so many of the challenges when it comes to the stadium, and so many of the challenges that clearly cannot be addressed. That is exactly why the government is going to terminate the POSS process - it looks like they are going to cut it off at the knees and push ahead with their own legislation. The reality is that the POSS process is a process that has already been established by this parliament. It was established by this parliament. It was the Premier's own bill that established the order for the POSS. For the POSS to stop, it probably needs, we assume, an order from the parliament itself. It seems that the government has either other advice or other strategies. Being the proponent, they can withdraw from the POSS and they are going to cut that off at the knees; that means there will not be public hearings, that means there will not be a final assessment report, and it is very clear why that is. It is because the stadium does not pass the muster.

The Planning Commission's report is clearly going to be highly critical and recommend against the stadium and what the government is doing is trying to avoid that, come what may. Therefore, holding a referendum after the release of the final integrated assessment report appears to be a moot point because the government, presumably with the support of Labor, is not going to allow that POSS process to continue and Tasmanians are not only not going to get the opportunity to participate in public hearings and have the opportunity to interrogate in detail some of the issues associated with the stadium, but they are not even going to get a final planning commission report in the first place.

It is with deep regret, we completely understand and respect the will of the Tasmanian people, and we know they do not like this stadium. We are confident that if the right question was asked, 'Do we want a stadium and do we want it at Mac Point?' the answer would be no but given the way this motion is written, and given it assumes a new stadium full stop, we Greens cannot support this motion. 

[12.28 p.m.]
Mrs PENTLAND (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I welcome the chance to speak on the independent member for Braddon, Mr Garland's, motion and thank him for bringing it to the House. It is a worthwhile motion because there is no doubt the proposal for a stadium at Macquarie Point is occupying the minds of thousands of Tasmanians. While I would argue there are many issues, including providing health services, housing and education, that are more pressing, the stadium is certainly number one at the box office when it comes to public debate. There are many members of our community who feel as though they have never really had their say.

Many people I speak to, and they are often footy fans, feel as though the stadium was a proposition that was put onto Tasmania rather than something we championed for ourselves. After all, in 2022 the Premier himself said that a stadium was not part of the state's bid for a team. They feel as though it is an unfair bar to reach in order to take our rightful place in the league. They tell me they feel as though their opposition to the stadium is not being heard. It breaks their hearts to be accused of not supporting a Tasmanian team because they are unwilling to swear allegiance to a not-yet-built stadium with a price tag that no-one can really estimate. This argument that you cannot support the team and not the stadium is condescending.

Yes, the AFL has made it clear it wants the stadium, but Tasmanians have every right to say they support the Devils no matter what their view is on the stadium. The Devils are alive and well. They have not run out on the park yet, but they have already got such soul. They have a hard-working team, which is growing all the time. They have a record amount of members and they have the most uniquely Tasmanian mascot you have ever seen.

You are allowed to support and admire a club without confessing your undying love for a hypothetical piece of infrastructure. I respect the Devil's CEO, Brendon Gale, when he talks about the commercial realities of the club and the role a new stadium would play, and I agree the team needs to play at modern venues to allow it to thrive. The idea that you have to offer blind support to the Macquarie Point Stadium in order to back the team is not something I am willing to accept.

Plans change all the time and often compromises have to be found. The government's my-way-or-the-highway, which the Labor opposition now endorses, is not something I am willing to cheer on. Hundreds and thousands of Tasmanians feel the same way. Polling has clearly shown that there is a huge reservation about the stadium, despite strong support for the idea of a team. Is the government really saying those people have no idea?

In Bass and Braddon, polling showed opposition to the Macquarie Point Stadium was above 60 per cent. That is too big to ignore. As I said, many feel like they have never really been heard or had their say. While the Liberals took a clear pro-stadium policy to the past election, a lot has changed since. The plan for the private sector to pick up the shortfall has been replaced by a desire to fund it by taking on more debt. The government wants to dump the planning process it promised it would follow.

This morning, we learnt that the Premier wants the vote on his enabling legislation to be Judgment Day. He says the POSS process will not continue if the vote loses. Is that not the will of the parliament? The government needs the parliament support for the POSS to end. How will it end if the parliament does not want it to? Yes, the government's support for the stadium has not changed since the election, but the goal posts have moved.

Labor has changed its position altogether, which I am sure has angered some who wanted them to continue to oppose the stadium. No one can look at the results of the last election and definitively say that it was a vote for against the stadium. After all, elections are won and lost on a variety of issues. Elections are not single-issue referendums.

This brings me to the heart of Mr Garland's motion. Should we have a referendum on a stadium? While I have some reservations about the potential costs and acknowledge that there would be a healthy debate over what the wording on the question should be, I keep being drawn back to the idea that Tasmanians deserve to have their say. Regardless of the results of today's vote, I believe the government should provide members of both houses with the resources they need to properly survey their constituents on this issue. Individual MPs cannot afford to undertake expensive polling, but Tasmanians deserve to be heard.

On principle, I am going to support Mr Garland's motion. Sometimes you just have to go with your heart.

[12.31 p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Deputy Speaker, I know that other people want to speak and I will try and make my points, although it is going to be hard because there is a lot in it. In relation to the member who has moved this motion, we have got to know each other very well over this last 12 months. I respect the member for Braddon, I enjoy his company, we do not always agree, but I think he takes this place seriously. I will make that statement because you could not be more wrong on this one, to be honest. I do not mean that disrespectfully, but you could not be more wrong.

This motion to call on a referendum: he quoted Roosevelt in talking about referendum in the USA; in the USA a number of states, close to half of the states, have propositions on ballots. If you look at California, they have a series of propositions that get up at various elections which make that place ungovernable. It is already in isolation, out of context of reality, out of context of facts. I have been to the States and I have spoken to political organisations on both sides of the street who reckon they can spend $2 million and they can get a proposition up regardless of how badly it is worded or regardless of the consequences.

In terms of these kinds of propositions, we are elected to do a job and there has been a number of contributions not only in this debate, but a number of debates, claiming support for X and Y. All of those questions put forward to people are in context to their view, what they have in front of them, the advice they have, the full question and the full knowledge. I am not saying people are naive. I am not saying people are not applying their own values and views on this matter. Sometimes in the debates that I have had with people, who are either lukewarm or against the stadium and the team, once I put some more information on the table, they change their position. I do not want money from the government for a poll of my own constituency. I will go and talk to them and I will put forward, based on my values and my views, what I think is the best way forward. We may not always agree with our constituents, with some or all, but they employ us as a delegated democracy, to make decisions on their behalf. If I had a dollar for every Tasmanian, north and south, who has told me, 'Can we just get that stadium built?' I reckon I could fund it myself.

The kind of support that is broadly out there and the arguments that are twisted, conflated and distorted, that are used against the Macquarie Point stadium really angers me, because at the end of day, we are here to do our job.

I am not saying that the government should be without scrutiny on this; I have been the most consistent politician on this since day one. I have always said that governments need to do more than one thing. They need to do health, education, public housing, public transport, and they also need to take advantage of opportunities that are put before the Tasmanian people that will grow the economy, that will deliver on a range of positive things and positive outcomes for the community. I have been consistent since day one on this.

Whilst the Macquarie Point stadium is a complex project - it is in a difficult place, it is not going to be cheap, and there are a number of issues that the TPC have raised which need to be managed - just because they have raised issues, it does not mean that the project fails and they are unable to be dealt with. The role of governments, public officials and departments is to ensure that when there are challenges around a complex issue, we apply our minds and our best people to resolve those, to ameliorate some of the negative outcomes, but also take advantage of the positive opportunities.

In terms of a referendum: I have recently been to Adelaide - and it has been publicised, and I paid for it myself - and met with Adelaide Football Club, met with the Premier of South Australia, and had a very extensive tour of the Adelaide Oval. To a person, they said if there was a referendum, or if someone had been asked prior to the redevelopment occurring, it would not have happened; because if they had a referendum, it would have gone down. They say now that since they have seen the benefits to the Adelaide community in terms of that Adelaide redevelopment, you can barely find anyone who would vote against it now.

In fact, I lived in Adelaide for a period and I have noticed the change in that state, and many people - economists, politicians, businesspeople - point to the redevelopment of the Adelaide Oval which was a trigger for that. I had a mate who I had many debates with about the Adelaide Oval upgrade, who said, 'Oh, it's a disgrace how much they are spending on that bridge' - there is a bridge across the River Torrens from the city to the Adelaide Oval. 'It's a disgrace, that bridge. They're spending too much money.' Do you know what they say now? 'The bridge isn't big enough, because you can't fit enough people on there. It's too squeezy. It's dangerous.' Once people see the benefit of something like this, and if as politicians we try to rise above some of the politics of the day, we can actually see something positive.

Regarding the licence for the Tasmanian team: one of the oppositions raised by the then-Deputy CEO Gillon McLachlan, was, 'You can't give Tasmania a team because they'll never agree. They'll always fight it out, and we can't agree.' Well, we are demonstrating that. Disagreement is important, but let us do it on the basis of fact. If people think that this is not about parochialism, it is partly about that. Let us look at what this opportunity is for Tasmania.

People are saying, 'We've got the Tassie Devils, isn't that fantastic? They're doing a great thing. They are employing people. They're going gangbusters, people support them.' What did the Devils say? 'We need a facility that underpins the financial strength of the team.'

As I have said before in this House, this is not an ego project. It is not a whim. To get a licence, you need to have a business case. Talking to the Adelaide Football Club and those clubs on the mainland that are successful, you have to have a revenue model out of the ground that underpins your business case. Without the business case, the team falls apart.

The stadium is not just about football. I have had people coming up to me and saying, 'Gee, it's a lot of money for seven games, David, because four of them will be in Launceston. We are spending a lot of money upgrading York Park to make sure we can have successful games in Launceston, so it should not be a north-south proposition. It is a lot of money for seven games.' If it was just for seven games, I would not support it. There are two things converging here. For 30-odd years, every time you talk to someone in the conferences or the conventions industry, they are saying, 'We need a bigger facility to host larger events.' They have been saying that for years.

The team and the licence we have wanted - just because we have some of the best players who have ever played the game - we have one of the greatest histories of Australian rules football in the country - just because we have had that, it does not mean you get a team. What we need to do is build a business case for the team. The AFL, for the first time in 30 years, are taking Tasmania seriously. They have awarded us a licence on the basis that we have a business case. What does the business case take? A facility that delivers revenue for the team.

Also, when you converge the two major things that are coming from the convention bureau and the conference people, this will fundamentally change the Hobart and the Tasmanian economy.

Now, other members have talked about the need for a convention centre in Launceston. Just because you live in Launceston does not mean I disagree. I live in Hobart. You need a convention centre and Launceston needs investment because it builds the economy. We should not be saying it is either Launceston or Hobart. This is a Tasmanian question and we need a Tasmanian result. You might as well put up a referendum saying Campbell Town should be the capital of Australia. You might as well say it, but it will never happen because it is not right. It is just not going to happen. To say that you can have a team, but not the stadium, it is a proposition that is not going to work, because the AFL have said clearly if you want a team, you need a business case. 

The business case relies on the facility that gives you a revenue model, that is the facility. Suburban grounds do not work. We do not play at Subiaco. We do not play at Football Park. We do not play at Windy Hill. We do not play at Victoria Park; all grounds historically that have had 50, 60, 70,000 people attend those grounds, but the economic model does not work. The uplift for the Tasmanian economy by having a multipurpose facility at Mac Point - there is no other place in Hobart where it can be. It is either there or we do not have it, and if we do not have it, we do not have a team.

That is not being naive, that is not being patronising to people, that is just the reality and we need to come to terms with it. Do not get up here and say you support the team but not the stadium because in the cold, hard light of day they are connected and we need to come to terms with that. 

In final, I respect the fact that people are passionate about this. They are passionate about football in Tasmania, they are passionate about the economic opportunity, but it is not a zero-sum game. We do need to invest.

Yes, we play AFL football at Bellerive. It is not an AFL-standard stadium. You talk to anyone in football and in the sporting community, it is not up to scratch. No disrespect to them, but they ran out of beer on the first day of the Ashes Test. I respect the member for Braddon, I really do. I love his passion, but he could not be more wrong on the issue of this AFL Stadium and the location of it.

Time expired.

MOTION

Efficiency Dividend Documents

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=8.7_D=0.1_C=0.86] [12.52 p.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I will require a vote. I move -

That the House orders the Treasurer, the Honourable Guy Barnett MP, to table the following information in the House by 4.00 p.m. on Thursday 8 May -

The total amount each agency was requested to save during the current financial year under the Tasmanian government’s efficiency dividend policy. 

(2)	The total amount saved during the current financial year through the Tasmanian government’s efficiency dividend, broken down by Agency. 

(3)	A summary of the measures taken to produce each Agency’s savings, including the value of each measure. 

(4)	The total number of job requests rejected through the Tasmanian government’s vacancy control and hiring freeze policies in the current financial year to date, broken down by agency.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=19.9_D=5.4_C=0.72] I will make it very clear that this is about the current financial year, so it is looking back in a way and it is not about next year's projected savings. We had a debate last year about projected savings [Bookmark: Phr10_O=116.8_D=11.0_C=0.78]  and there was some concern from some members that they were worried advice being given to the government around savings strategies would be made in the public domain, and [Bookmark: Phr11_O=128.6_D=25.1_C=0.79]  that would have detrimental effect on the capacity of public servants to give frank and fearless advice. I disagreed with that at the time. We were after the settled savings strategies, but this is about what has taken place to date in the current financial year, so I will make that very clear from the outset.

As I have said in previous [Bookmark: Phr12_O=154.0_D=5.9_C=0.92]  debates on ordering the production of documents [Bookmark: Phr13_O=161.4_D=29.7_C=0.86] , the parliament has the explicit right and power to order the production of documents, just like the government has a right to claim immunity. My thoughts about that are well established. They are on the public record. That is a feature of our Westminster parliamentary system, which is, for all its faults, one of the best systems - or the best system, in my opinion - on the globe; you only have to look at [Bookmark: Phr14_O=191.2_D=25.3_C=0.82]  the uncertainty with geopolitics and other systems, which are struggling with human rights issues, and trade, economic and social issues. 

We are very fortunate that we have responsible government in Tasmania and Australia. That does not mean the government being responsible in a budgetary sense or social policy, it means that they sit in the parliament and are accountable to other parliamentarians. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=217.4_D=3.4_C=0.76]  They make collective decisions and they are accountable for those [Bookmark: Phr16_O=221.0_D=10.4_C=0.84]  and there are certain provisions to protect those collective decisions. All my thoughts on that are on the public record, and they stand for this debate [Bookmark: Phr17_O=234.0_D=9.2_C=0.93] . 

This is an important transparency measure. We have a government that has been less than transparent when it comes to managing the budget. [Bookmark: Phr18_O=244.9_D=27.2_C=0.75]  I have produced examples in previous debates about former governments that produced whole chapters of budget saving strategies in previous budgets and I will refer to the budget from 2011-2012, which has been talked about at length in this parliament and in committees and a whole range of other things. For newer members, you can look these up on the Treasury website [Bookmark: Phr19_O=273.1_D=29.6_C=0.78] . There is a budgets archive section where you can look up the 2011-2012 Budget. There is a whole chapter - chapter 4 - on how the government of the day was trying to save money, rightly or wrongly. 

This government has not produced anything like that, and I have heard the questions in this House in question time from some of the crossbench around what is an essential worker and what is not an essential worker. If someone was not an essential worker, why [Bookmark: Phr20_O=302.9_D=2.0_C=0.50]  were they employed in the first place? There has been a lot of discussion in the public domain, too, around the sorts of workers it may or may not include. Here is your chance to give some of those answers. We have not had a definitive answer from this government on what an essential worker is or what a non-essential worker is. This would produce some of the information around the positions that have been targeted for savings. 

The first part of the motion asks for the total amount each agency was requested to save during the current financial year under the Tasmanian government's efficiency dividend policy. Some may question why I put that in there when it is in the Budget. There is a section in the Budget outlining what each agency has to save . However, the point of that is whether there has been any policy and parameter changes from this government. 

We have had the government walk in to this place this year and make some quite drastic announcements, including privatisation of government assets. Everything is for sale. The Premier has told us it is effectively a fire sale because he needs to manage debt. There was that huge announcement. We had the Treasurer, at a time it was trendy for conservatives to act like Trump, talking about his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) set-up to try to find savings. We had a hiring freeze, which was announced as parliament returned this year.

Have there been any policy and parameter changes? Has there been pushback from departments? Some departments may say: 'We cannot do that this financial year for these reasons, but we could probably save some more through the efficiency dividend next year.' Perhaps, there is some compromise there. Have there been any policy and parameter changes in that regard?

When it comes to the efficiency dividend, we know it is lazy policy and lazy politics. It is not just me as shadow treasurer who has said that. The media have called this government out through editorials. You have respected people like Saul Eslake talking about the inefficiencies it creates. Mr Eslake has talked at length about his experience working for ANZ Bank, and how the bank was driven by the bottom line. A decision was made by the board that it needed to make some savings in the business. The decision-making then filters down through the organisation, so you do not have any strategic decision-making. You have middle managers saying: 'We need to save this much in our unit. Maybe we will let these positions go.' There is actually no strategic direction of the policy. That can create inefficiencies in service delivery, which impacts Tasmanians. 

It would be interesting to know what sorts of positions are being targeted through the efficiency dividend. It is a matter of transparency. There has been some debate, whether it is in Health -

MOTION

Efficiency Dividend Documents

Resumed from above (page 53).

[2.30 p.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, before the break, I was talking about transparency of governments past and the difficulty we have had in trying to get the same level of transparency from this government with its efficiency dividend policy. By way of example, I pointed out the budget from 2011-2012. It outlines agency savings strategies and goes through comprehensive lists. If you look at Education, they were implementing and reviewing the education system process, extending a voluntary workforce renewal program, deferring the rollout of child and family centres - a great Labor initiative establishing a single corporate services model. It goes on and on with the different things they were doing. They were trying to be very transparent back then, but we have not had that same level from this government.

My motion last year to get the savings strategies was unsuccessful, but this one is different because we are looking at the current financial year; not things that may or may not be finalised in the lead-up to the Budget. It is important we get this information because many Tasmanians are starting to realise that this government has not been good at managing the budget and has lost its way. We are in the biggest deficits the state has ever seen, extraordinary deficits, record debt, with a debt servicing cost of $500 million in the last year of the forward Estimates. That is just to service the debt, not to pay it off, and we know it is going to get worse. 

This year's Budget will be a real test for the Treasurer on whether he can stop that ballooning debt. He may talk about a pathway to surplus. He tried to do that for 12 months without showing any evidence of it. In fact, Saul Eslake said the only evidence of a pathway to surplus was if you turned the charts upside down. You may try to skate through and do the same thing again, but we will be looking very closely at that debt figure and I suspect it is going to keep increasing because it is not stabilised.

What do we have to show for all of that? The economy is flatlining. We have business confidence taking a huge hit in the new Roy Morgan poll, with a 17 per cent crash over the last 12 months. The government is propping up the economy with debt-funded Tasmanian taxpayer spending. We have public services at breaking point, facing cuts because the government has not been able to manage the budget well. That impacts Tasmanians. 

We have some of the worst health outcomes in the country. We have the Premier, who was the health minister, promising, when he was shadow health minister, to make Tasmania the healthiest state by 2025. He has not lived up to that. He has been part of the government and now the leader of the government for a long time. 

We have some of the worst education outcomes in the country, and we know education is one of the biggest levers state governments of any colour can pull to improve the lives of Tasmanians and improve outcomes in lots of other areas, whether it is justice, health or economic prosperity. 

As I mentioned before the lunch break, I have been taking note of some of the crossbench and questions this year about what is an essential worker what is a non-essential worker? If you talk about something like education, which I know well, it is all very well to say they are not targeting roles in schools. However, if you remove a curriculum officer, you remove support from schools. If you remove someone from the school office, you remove support for teachers in the school. If you remove a principal network leader - and we know being a principal is an incredibly tough job these days, the principals end up with a bigger burden and no support from within the department. We want some transparency about these positions. 

Going back to managing the budget and what we have to show for it, it is unfortunate that we have had nine consecutive quarters of negative interstate migration. That means there are more people moving to the mainland for better opportunities than are moving here. Our population would be in decline if not for overseas migration. We know population is a key contributor to economic growth. It is flatlining under this government. Population flow is a good indicator of how the government is managing its policy settings and direction, and delivering its policy agenda, whether it is delivering certainty and predictability, whether the economy is going well. At the moment there is a huge outflow, which is a massive problem for all of us and the quality of life we can live here. We have skills shortages. We need good, skilled people here contributing their taxes to the services we all rely upon and contributing to the economy for prosperity and economic growth. That is what we have to show at the moment for this record debt.

The government has not been great in terms of its budget projections and managing to meet its own targets. For example, it is pretty much in breach of all the strategies in its fiscal strategy. That has caused the credit rating agencies to say it is not worth the paper it is written on, effectively, because there is no budget discipline in Tasmania. We know their numbers in the budget cannot be believed either. If you look at expenditure growth over the last 20 years, it grows every year but the government, after former treasurer Michael Ferguson's last effort in 2023-24, of 14.7 per cent growth for the government sector, was predicting negative 3.5 per cent government expenditure growth. It had never happened in the 20 years beforehand, including that Budget in 2011-12 that has been talked about a lot. It never happened, and they thought it was a reasonable thing to project in the Budget.

I said at the time to treasurer Ferguson, 'You are either going to implement the biggest austerity budget in more than 20 years, or you are going to blow the budget.' What happened? He got a little bit miffed when I said that. He said, 'It is not a certainty that we will blow the budget', but what happened? We had a Revised Estimates Report and a nearly half-a-billion dollar blowout. It was entirely predictable. They spent $4 million a day more than what they projected in the Budget.

I have put that challenge, I have set a test for ballooning debt for the Treasurer. I have said in this place that I will be looking at his projections in the forward Estimates very carefully too. I recall him saying in this place that he wanted to look at that and make sure that they were reasonable assumptions. We will be looking at those assumptions in this year's budget to see if they are believable, Treasurer, and holding you to that test as well. If you are projecting negative 3.5 per cent expenditure growth, which has never been achieved in 20 years, your figures will not be believable either, and you will be doing the same thing. You will be coming to parliament with a supplementary appropriation bill, effectively on the credit card, with no plan to pay for it, and asking the parliament for more money.

They are not managing the budget well, and it is so dire that you now have the credit rating agencies breathing down our necks. They are setting a test for this government as well. We had S&P late last year come out and downgrade their outlook for Tasmania from stable to negative. They set a test. They said that if this government breaches 120 per cent debt to operating revenue, it may give them cause to downgrade our credit rating, which would effectively mean higher interests on that record debt that they have racked up. They said that there was a rising debt burden and they were concerned so much that they had to downgrade the outlook for Tasmania from stable to negative.

At Moody's earlier this year there was talk about weakening governance in Tasmania. We had both rating agencies talking in the media about the fiscal strategy, how it was unambitious and was not really worth the paper it was written on because this government was showing no budget discipline or fiscal discipline to abide by any of it. Moody's talked about weakening governance as well. They set a test with their downgrade in their outlook from stable to negative: they said 130 per cent by, I believe, fiscal year 2026.

You have the credit agencies saying that Tasmania cannot go on doing what it has been doing, which is spending. This government has been spending with no plan to pay for it. When 65 per cent of the revenue comes from the federal government, you have to be very disciplined in how you manage the Tasmanian finances. We are not like other states. We do not have the same levers to pull. We are in that sort of state where the credit agencies are saying those sorts of things.

We are in this situation now where this government is implementing cuts and efficiency dividends. It has a privatisation agenda. It has gone pretty quiet about that for a while. I think their federal colleagues said, 'Please stop talking about privatisation during the federal election, it is probably not helping us much,' because they know how unpopular it is. That is why they did not take it to the election. They did not have the courage of their convictions to go to the election and say, 'We are going to sell these things,' and try to sell the merits of it. The message we got from the Premier earlier this year was that he needed to pay off debt and that everything was for sale apart from the Hydro, although there are parts of Hydro that may be for sale.

I may take the opportunity to wrap up there, because I would like to sum up at the end. Hopefully I will be able to get the opportunity to do that after I have heard other members' comments. I know there is an amendment from the government, so I will listen to that debate as well. I know that there are other members who want to speak. I would like to respond to that which [Bookmark: Phr3_O=10.6_D=11.3_C=0.74]  - I am learning in this House that you can do that, so I will finish up there. Given that there is only an hour and a half of the debate, I will listen to the other members and then take that opportunity at the end, hopefully.

[2.42 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Deputy Premier) -  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=22.8_D=1.9_C=0.65] Honourable Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to respond to [Bookmark: Phr6_O=38.6_D=5.0_C=0.59]  the Shadow Treasurer in respect to this motion [Bookmark: Phr7_O=45.1_D=20.4_C=0.84] . I will go through each part of the motion shortly, but my introductory remarks I will say that the shadow treasurer is consistently and relentlessly negative about our economy and business in this state and the prospects for the future. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=67.3_D=2.8_C=0.78]  It is disappointing, but not surprising. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=71.5_D=20.6_C=0.88] 

We have received the National Australia Bank survey indicating confidence levels are the highest in the country. We have the economy growing, record retail sales, unemployment at historic lows [Bookmark: Phr10_O=93.4_D=10.0_C=0.92] . We have every intention to continue the good work that has occurred [Bookmark: Phr11_O=104.4_D=1.2_C=0.87] , where we have seen [Bookmark: Phr12_O=107.0_D=1.5_C=0.90]  since 2014 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=110.3_D=2.7_C=0.91]  more than 26 per cent growth in our economy [Bookmark: Phr14_O=114.0_D=3.8_C=0.85] , more than $40 billion in gross state product [Bookmark: Phr15_O=118.8_D=24.6_C=0.84] . These are some very good numbers, but we know there is a lot more to do and we have a very, very big reform agenda. 

There was a mention of the GBE reforms; no mention of the red tape reforms or the streamlining of that for business and the 40,000 small businesses tha [Bookmark: Phr16_O=144.2_D=4.2_C=0.86] t so desperately need and appreciate that sort of support. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=149.1_D=15.0_C=0.75]  It was certainly a topic of conversation in Question Time today, but as a government we back small business to the hilt and will continue to do so. We know that they are the engine room of our economy, particularly in the rural and regional areas like in my electorate of Lyons, in the [Bookmark: Phr18_O=166.9_D=13.4_C=0.77]  electorate of Mark Shelton and others. There is no question about that. This is the shadow treasurer who lauded the federal Labor government budget [Bookmark: Phr19_O=181.5_D=23.0_C=0.73]  which has a trillion dollars of debt and deficits right through for the next 10 years. 

We have made it very clear, as I said today as recently as this morning, we have a very strong plan. The 2030 Strong Plan will continue with those commitments, and in terms of that pla [Bookmark: Phr20_O=206.2_D=0.5_C=0.96] n we will deliver [Bookmark: Phr21_O=208.6_D=7.4_C=0.87]  a Budget. I will deliver a Budget which is strong on economic responsibility [Bookmark: Phr22_O=216.8_D=1.5_C=0.97]  and sustainability [Bookmark: Phr23_O=219.3_D=9.4_C=0.76]  and with a pathway to surplus. That will be clear for all to see. It will be open and transparent. The big question will be how [Bookmark: Phr24_O=229.4_D=17.1_C=0.85]  will Labor respond and will there be an alternative budget? That is the call. This Chamber called for that last year and we call for it again. We want that commitment that there will be an alternative budget. [Bookmark: Phr25_O=248.9_D=8.9_C=0.85]  We want the negativity to cease. 

I say right up front in response specifically to this motion [Bookmark: Phr26_O=259.6_D=17.8_C=0.84] , my grateful thanks for the incredible hard work that Tasmania's public servants, across every single department in every community, continue to deliver the essential services that Tasmanians appreciate [Bookmark: Phr27_O=278.7_D=26.2_C=0.81]  and know how important it is. I thank the public service for delivering those services. They do it with dedication, with professionalism and with care. They are the backbone of our state service and their contribution underpins, frankly, the wellbeing of every Tasmanian: those essential services of health, education, community safety, housing and so much more. The motion today, frankly, is just another political stunt by the Labor Party to scare people, to scare the community, and scare specifically the hard-working public servants, who I have just acknowledged, appreciate and admire.

It was the Labor policy, announced not so long ago, to abolish the associate secretary positions in the state services as part of their budget repair. We would like to know more about their $2 billion in savings that they announced during the election campaign. We will look forward to hearing more about that.

However, our policy as a government is not about diminishing the value of our public service or those services, far from it. We are taking a very careful look at where we can improve and ensure taxpayer dollars are spent wisely, so that the Tasmanian community has the services it needs and deserves. We are reviewing the efficiency and the productivity of our public services. I note that the Federal Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, on Sunday evening I believe, said that productivity improvements would be a key part and a key objective of the federal Labor government over the next three years.

That is our policy in Tasmania, I am not saying he is adopting our policy directly, but it is a very similar message. The Federal Labor treasurer is focused on productivity improvements. We have made the merit of that clear. I have talked about the importance of cutting red tape to support small business, medium business, larger business and industry. I have talked about the reforming of our government businesses, which is ongoing. That will be the biggest transformational reform in 30 years and this will set us up for the next 30 years.

We are all about ensuring that our public service remains strong, responsive and sustainable into the future. It is about better positioning our workforce to meet the growing demands, to streamline the processes and modernise the service delivery. The honourable minister Ogilvie knows the importance of the digitisation and IT improvements which we are continuing to invest in and the merit of that. We will continue in that regard and we are not just about a cost-cutting exercise for the sake of it. This is a strategic initiative that is focused on productivity, efficiency, renewal and it is a balanced thoughtful approach; one that respects the service of our public sector, it supports the workforce renewal and ensures Tasmanians continue to receive the high-quality services that they rely on.

I will now provide answers to points one to three, which I will outline to the House now and note that very clearly. I will be seeking an amendment which I am foreshadowing now officially, today, for the provision of the information under point four, to be extended by a week, to Friday 16 May 2025.

The SPEAKER - Can I clarify if you are wanting - yes.

Mr BARNETT - I will do that very shortly once I have responded to the first three points. The information relating to point four requires collation of information from each agency which is not held centrally, so that will take a little extra time, hence the amendment.

If I could just be very clear now in terms of the response to the total amount each agency was requested to save during the current financial year under the Tasmanian government's Efficiency Dividend Policy, which is the first point of the motion from the opposition. The answer is as follows: if Mr Willie had read the budget papers, he would already know that this information was presented in the 2024-25 budget papers at the Policy and Parameters statement 
and I highlight table 4.5 on pages 69 to 84 of Budget Paper number one. In terms of point two, the total amount saved during the current financial year through the Tasmanian Government's Efficiency Dividend, broken down by agency and in terms of the answer, the Department of Treasury and Finance received data from agencies and reports on the actual expenditure at the output level, not by initiative or sub-initiative. The individual outputs are not broken down or separated into individual policy or parameter line items.

The estimated outcome, which will be disclosed in agency chapters in the 2025-26 budget, will show individual estimates outcomes for each agency at an output level. This will show whether agencies are meeting their budget targets, which include their budget efficiency dividend (BED) targets. The Department of Treasury and Finance also provides regular public and reporting as required under the state's reporting framework through quarterly reports. The most recent, the 2024-25 December quarterly report, was published alongside the 2024-25 Revised Estimates Report. The 2024-25 March quarterly report will be published in the 2025-26 budget papers on 29 May 2025.

Agencies will need to report on their achievement of savings and other measures, including a discussion on key deliverables in their annual reports. In response to point three of the motion, a summary of the measures taken to produce each agency's savings, including the value of each measure under the Financial Management Act 2016, the Treasurer's instruction, be they financial management accountable authorities or agency heads, are responsible to their ministers for the in-year management of their agency budget, including managing budget pressures within existing budget allocations.

This means that the departments are expected to find efficiencies for this year's Budget. The general principles of how those savings are to be achieved are as follows, and I will outline those now: One, savings measures must be achievable in both the short term and the long term. This means that agencies must identify savings measures that are structural and achievable on an ongoing basis. It is acknowledged that some savings measures will have a lead time, particularly those making structural or service delivery changes. In these instances, short-term savings measures may be used to meet allocated savings until the longer term measures can be implemented.

Two, savings measures must be allocated to activities and costs within the control or influence of the agency. In general terms, this means that savings measures should be applied to controlled activities and not applied to administered items or for specific activities funded from specific external parties, such as the Australian Government. Three, savings measures must consider operational impacts. This means that the savings measures must consider matters including, but not limited to, timing and transitional issues, staffing impact, internal communications, and change-management requirements.

Four, savings measures must not negatively impact the outcomes of frontline services. This means that while a savings measure can be allocated to any agency operating cost allowed within these principles, including those associated with frontline services, such as reduction of staff, it should have no impact or limit the impact on the intended outcome of frontline services - that is, no reduction in services.

Five, savings measure achievement must be able to be reliably reported to the budget committee. This means that agencies must be able to regularly and accurately report on the progress to the budget committee.

As noted above, accountable authorities are required to manage their agency budgets in accordance with the Financial Management Act and associated Treasurer's Instructions and 'Financial Management - Better Practice Guidelines.' This includes decision-making and implementation of savings measures.

With respect to (4), the total number of job requests rejected from the Tasmanian government's basic vacancy control and hiring freeze policies in the current financial year to date broken down by agency and job title - I ask first that the House note the answers I provided to points (1) to (3), and with respect to (4),  [Bookmark: _Hlk197526013] I now officially move my amendment. I move -

First amendment

Remove the word: "table"

Insert instead: "provide to all members of parliament"

Second amendment

Remove the words: "in the House by 4pm on Thursday 8 May"

Insert instead: "by 4pm on Friday 16 May"

The SPEAKER - Do you wish to speak to the amendment now or do you feel that you have covered it in your collaborative piece?

Mr BARNETT - I think I have covered it pretty well and I have explained that in my introductory remarks. I think there needs to be an adequate amount of time to respond and provide that information, so that is the reason for the amendment. I hope that is acceptable and agreeable to members in this Chamber.

I will leave it there. I know others would like to speak on this important matter. I commend the amendment to the Chamber.

Mr Willie - Are we speaking to the amendment?

The SPEAKER - You can speak to the amendment, but I will allow other members to speak to the amendment and the substantive motion because of the constraint with time.

Mr Bayley - I will do that, but I am happy to hear from Mr Willie.

The SPEAKER - I am happy to be flexible given this shortened time for the debate.

Mr Willie - I will speak to the amendment and then do summing up.

The SPEAKER - We are technically on the amendment but I will allow people to canvass the existing substantive motion.

[3.00 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for bringing this motion forward and indicate at the outset that we Greens are certainly willing to support it. It is a transparency measure and we see great benefit in any and all transparency, not least when it comes to the state's finances and some of the highly controversial and highly dubious, it must be said, approaches that the government is taking towards the Budget.

There is significant concern about the Budget; that is really clear. It is driving concern about specific spending initiatives - projects like the stadium, for example, cuts and the like. There is also significant concern simply because the government has shown a casual willingness and ability to ignore expert advice, including advice that they themselves commissioned.

The work of Saul Eslake that was commissioned by the government on the request of the Jacqui Lambie Network was a really important piece of work. It demonstrated that there are significant challenges ahead and that the government is seriously challenged when it comes to its financial management of this state. That was thrown in the bin immediately - it was acknowledged and some nice platitudes were said about Mr Eslake, then it was rejected outright.

When it comes to the kinds of measures that the member for Clark is seeking to get some transparency about through this motion - efficiency dividends, hiring freezes, vacancy control and the like - Mr Eslake has been really clear in labelling these as lazy measures. They are ineffective measures and they do not work, so it is entirely reasonable for us in this House to be seeking additional transparency in this space. As a result, we support the motion.

The February Revised Estimates Report demonstrated just how challenging things were when it comes to budget chaos. The deficit blew out to $1.3 billion, up by $500 million. Net debt was up and is projected to be $9.6 billion by 2027-28. Mr Eslake is [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=24.9_C=0.78]  predicting a $16 billion debt burden for the state by 2035, taking a remarkable $750 million a year to service. The challenges are great, and the more information and the more transparency we have about this, absolutely the better.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=56.0_D=15.3_C=0.71] I stand on a unity ticket with Mr Willie when it comes to criticising the government about their pathway to surplus. There is no pathway to surplus. It is an absolute mirage. There is no pathway to surplus and if you are going to continue that line, Treasurer, into this next budget cycle and at the next Budget, then it is incumbent upon you to be clearer about that pathway to surplus. If you believe it is there, Treasurer, I invite you to unpack it more clearly for this House and for the Tasmanian people.

Mr Barnett - It is in the Budget on 29 May.

The SPEAKER - Thank you. We will hear the member. No-one interjected on you, Treasurer, and you still have time to take the call.

Mr BAYLEY -  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=96.6_D=12.6_C=0.61] We do not see pathways to surplus, and there are experts out there who are advising us and saying publicly that they also do not see any pathway to surplus [Bookmark: Phr6_O=109.7_D=28.8_C=0.80] . There certainly will not be unless you deviate from some of the current trajectories. Dismissing outright Mr Eslake's propositions about increasing revenue as opposed to cost savings, or Mr Eslake's proposition around managing the infrastructure spend and setting a budget and prioritising projects that sit under that budget, and making sure you can afford them as opposed to the approach you currently have, which is effectively [Bookmark: Phr7_O=139.1_D=2.2_C=0.61]  picking and choosing winners in projects [Bookmark: Phr8_O=141.7_D=24.6_C=0.75]  and writing blank cheques for projects such as the Macquarie Point stadium, a stadium that the Planning Commission says is going to add $1.8 billion debt to our books over 10 years, costing an additional $76 million a year to service. 

There are serious challenges there. I put on the record again our overt opposition to [Bookmark: Phr9_O=167.1_D=10.2_C=0.74]  the notion of privatising public assets as a way to plug the budget black hole, as a way to service some of those debt requirements [Bookmark: Phr10_O=177.6_D=25.5_C=0.84]  and as a way to make the budget look a little bit better. 

It is important that we get this kind of information and we get it in a timely fashion. We are going into a budget cycle. We are going to hear the Treasurer's Budget in a couple of weeks. We are going to produce an alternative budget, and having these kinds of figures available to us would be important and useful [Bookmark: Phr11_O=204.0_D=6.0_C=0.85]  to inform the thinking and inform the analysis that goes into our budget. I make the point in terms o [Bookmark: Phr12_O=211.5_D=23.0_C=0.85] f the government's approach to the Labor Party - they literally have a motion on the books that we are going to debate this afternoon calling on the Labor Party itself to produce an alternative budget. Fair enough, but if you are going to do that, give them the information. Give us the information we need to be able to inform that and make some informed and credible decisions.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=237.5_D=12.7_C=0.66] The Treasurer described this as a scare campaign. I do not know where the scare is here. People are scared already, Treasurer. People are scared for their jobs. People are scared for the services that rely on those jobs [Bookmark: Phr14_O=250.6_D=30.0_C=0.80] , and they are scared by the efficiency dividends and the hiring freezes that your government has announced. I do not see how increasing transparency around those 'savings' could be considered a scare campaign. It is a transparency campaign. This is a transparency motion, not a scare motion. Whenever you see someone throw up the sort of allegations of a scare campaign and start throwing barbs across the Chamber like that [Bookmark: Phr15_O=280.7_D=24.1_C=0.82] , you realise that there is something to hide. I reject that outright. This is all about transparency.

When it comes to the Treasurer's contribution, I heard him basically say that the first three lots of information being requested by this motion are effectively publicly available at the moment and relatively easy to seek out. I do not necessarily accept that number three is publicly available. The Treasurer talked about the detailed parameters that are informing some of these decisions, but he did not actually talk about the measures that have been taken by each agency to produce the savings. So, there are the parameters around it that he did detail, but not necessarily the savings that are being undertaken. 

If that is the case, it should not take too much for the government to compile them and put them on the Table of this House by tomorrow afternoon. When it comes to the fourth, I believe this is really important information: the total number of job requests rejected through the Tasmanian government's vacancy control and hiring freeze policies in the current financial year to date, broken down by agency and job total.

That should be relatively easy information. Each of the agencies has their advisory panels and systems in place. They know how many jobs they have advised; they know how many that would be lost. It should not take too much information to send a message to each of those different agencies and request them to detail what have been their HR figures to date, particularly when it comes to the job requests rejected because of the vacancy control and hiring freezes.

When it comes to the amendment, I clearly see what you are trying to do here. You are trying to get an extra week to pull this information together and, of course, if we are not sitting next Friday 16 May, there is no mechanism for you to table that information, providing it to all members of parliament. I can see the logic. I do not think there is anything untoward here, but I do not think that you need an extra week to pull this information together. I think this information should be relatively easy to ascertain.

You have already given us a summary of your view on the first three points. Dealing with the fourth should be a pretty simple exercise of getting in touch with the agency heads over the - assuming this motion passes, immediately after this motion passes and having it put on the table by 4:00 p.m. tomorrow - 

Mr Shelton - One day. One day.

Mr BAYLEY - should not be too much of a stretch. There are a whole lot of departments in these agencies, Mr Shelton, that are looking after HR, so I do not see it as a huge problem. I will leave it there because I know Mr Willie wants to set up. Perhaps Mr Shelton has something to say as part of this debate as well, I am not sure, but we certainly support this motion. We can appreciate the sentiment behind the amendment and do not see anything untoward about it, but I do not see it as being a necessary amendment to this motion for the government to do its work. We look forward to seeing this information in due course.

[3.10 p.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - I can indicate we do not support the amendment. The Treasurer outlined some parameters. He said that the heads of agency are responsible for managing budgets, achieving short-term/long-term savings, some with a short-term focus, some with a lead-in time. They need to be allocated to activities within its control and not subject to other programs. You gave an example of the federal government maybe funding things and having a program. They need to consider its operational impacts, must not negatively impact services, or limit the impact to frontline services and be reliable to be reported to the budget committee.

The reason we do not support this is it would be a real worry that if these things are not being recorded in departments in real time to achieve the efficiency dividend, I would expect that departments have this information available to them now, particularly given the level of detail that the Treasurer outlined.

I do not think it is unreasonable for this information to be tabled. We are looking at the last financial year up to date. The departments have to achieve these targets and there would be a level of documentation around that. It is different from the debate last year, where we were looking into the future and people were worried about advice and things like that; this is completely different. I believe that the government could provide this information tomorrow.

[3.12 p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Honourable Speaker, I will be brief. A number of these similar motions have been proposed and moved around information that is in the public interest, although some of the previous motions moved by Labor are more speculative, in terms of some of the information that they are requiring. The information that they are seeking in this motion is consistent, I believe, with more a factual outcome. I understand that the minister's comments about this in relation to the amendment that has been proposed by the minister - I may have missed his comments - if he committed to circulating it with the new date of next week, it does not have to be tabled. 

If you would circulate that, and I know the amendment but in terms of the information which gives effect to that - I may have missed that as I was out of the House and in a meeting, to me that is important. I believe 24 hours' notice with some of the information is not a big ask - but the element around the job requests and denials, that is micro data inside a department that may not be readily aggregated up into a report within the short period of time, given everything else that the department is doing heading into a budget period.

I think that information is really important. In our haste to obtain the information, I can imagine a world where if the information is wrong, you are moving a censure motion saying that the minister has misled the House. That may be inadvertent because you have not given him enough time.

Mr Bayley - That is a stretch.

Mr O'BYRNE - I saw your no-confidence motion in Duigan recently, and you did not cover yourself in any glory there. The information is important; it does need to be in the public domain. I support the request. I believe given the cycle we are in, heading into a budget only weeks away, in terms of the work that I know hundreds of public sector workers are doing in terms of pulling that together, there is a fair bit of work. We want the information. A period of five working days effectively is not an unreasonable request to seek that extra information. I would support the amendment. I support the motion in getting the information out publicly. It is not a fishing exercise. It is specific information. I believe the House will be informed heading into the budget cycle, or the budget debate in the budget weeks and estimates. That information is important. I support the motion.

Mr Willie - By way of interjection through the Speaker, could you indicate whether you support the motion without amendment?

Mr O'BYRNE - I support the amendment. I will be voting for the amendment. You did not circulate the - 

Mr Willie - It is not my amendment.

Mr O'BYRNE - Yes. I know. I have not made up my mind. I believe that a reasonable amount of time should be given to the minister's office. They have agreed to give you the information; an extra few working days is, I believe, in the spirit of trying to get the information, not an unreasonable request. As I said, one element of the information you request, having been a minister and understanding that there are a whole lot of things that go on, the last thing that you would want is for the minister to inadvertently mislead the House. I am sure, Mr Willie, that is not what your intent is. 

If you want that information within 24 hours, it either may not be provided in a form which is accurate or correct, or it may not be able to be pulled together. There are assumptions from outside of government about what happens inside government in terms of what information they have. I can tell you that is a bit of data that will take a little time to work through, and to double check. It has to go through multiple eyes from different outputs of departments, up through senior managers and deputy secretaries to departmental secretaries and heads of government. These processes occur. If you want the correct information, it is not an unreasonable amendment. You will get the motion up with that amendment. You may not without it. 

Amendments agreed to.

[3.18 p.m.]
Mr SHELTON (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, it is a great thing that amendment passed because, as I interjected -

The SPEAKER - Inappropriately, but let us not go there.

Mr SHELTON - My apologies, honourable Speaker. For the parliament to ask a minister to come up with information in one day, the day has not passed yet, so it will be late on the afternoon of the Wednesday to supply that information by the Thursday. The minister indicated that some of that information is in the Budget from last year. Nevertheless, when you go back to agencies, it is going to take them time to double-check to make sure the information is relevant and correct. As the member for Franklin who just spoke indicated, it is not an appropriate amount of time if we want accuracy in the information that comes into this Chamber.

The member who moved the motion went into the finances of Tasmania. When I entered this parliament, between 2010 and 2014 we had unemployment at 8 per cent. Unemployment was high. Now it is at 4 per cent, half the rate. It has never been there before in my life. What we have been able to achieve in the 11 years since 2014 is an unemployment rate that, at times, has been among the best in the nation. Tasmania has been punching well above its weight. 

We only have this very small economy and everybody appreciates that, so you do get fluctuations. Population has been mentioned. You get people coming to the state at times and leaving the state at times. It is a shame that many of our university graduates have to go to Melbourne and Sydney to achieve their goals. That does not mean the Tasmanian economy is poor. It simply talks about where the opportunities for those young people are. Hobart has a high percentage of engineers and academics because of the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS), CSIRO and so forth, but that is not spread uniformly across the state, particularly in the north. Those science-based people need to find their own niche in life and expand their opportunities.

The member talked about people leaving the state and coming back in. Going back to when I first came into this parliament, over those four years, you could go to the airport and all you saw was high-vis. There were no jobs here and everybody was putting on a high-vis jacket and heading to the mainland. Now what we have, when you look around the state, is positions vacant, people wanted. You have a look at the shopfronts and around the place; there are opportunities for people around the state. That is a positive for Tasmania. 

We need to employ everyone, but from the agricultural point of view, if it were not for federal governments of both colours setting up processes to attract labour from the Pacific islands into the agriculture sector, we would not be able to get the work done. There would be no unemployment because there would be job vacancies all over the show. That is a good thing as far as our economy goes. It shows that there are a lot of businesses out there, big and small, that are investing in their businesses to employ people and struggling to find the people they need.

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=16.8_D=29.6_C=0.71] Regarding efficiency dividends, I was a TAFE teacher before I came into here, and efficiency dividends and vacancy control have been used all my working life. I was in the TAFE from 1981. In the period from 2000 to 2010, when there was a Labor government, there were redundancy packages offered to my work colleagues [Bookmark: Phr3_O=47.4_D=27.9_C=0.78]  and efficiency dividends being asked of TAFE colleges back in those days. It is not a new process we are going through. It is what governments do in order to keep their expenses under control and it is about prudent management of the budget. 

The Treasurer is going through his budget process right now and will deliver the Budget on 29 May. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=76.1_D=25.8_C=0.83]  Of course, that is a huge effort by Treasury and the Treasurer. We are representative of the Tasmanian community and it is about spending the Tasmanian taxpayers' money prudently, making sure it is efficient and we can get the best value out of those dollars  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=102.8_D=6.9_C=0.81] we can. I look forward to the Budget the same as everybody else here to see where this Treasurer [Bookmark: Phr6_O=110.1_D=10.2_C=0.71]  has taken it. I congratulate the Treasurer on the work he is doing.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=122.7_D=8.3_C=0.79] As far as these numbers are concerned, we are talking about [Bookmark: Phr8_O=132.8_D=3.5_C=0.71]  a financial year that has not finished yet. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=137.5_D=5.7_C=0.71]  It is 7 May today and the financial year goes to the end of June, so there is approximately 10 per cent of the year left. You cannot account for that [Bookmark: Phr11_O=153.1_D=7.3_C=0.78]  last bit accurately until you actually get to that point.

[3.22 p.m.]
Mr STREET (Franklin) -  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=164.8_D=2.4_C=0.50]  [Bookmark: Phr14_O=169.3_D=13.3_C=0.59]  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=184.5_D=4.6_C=0.62] Honourable Speaker, this is not the first time we have seen the Labor Party bring in a motion calling on the tabling of documents with less than 24 hours' notice, so I thank the House for supporting the amendment the Treasurer moved. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=202.9_D=14.9_C=0.69]  I caught the end of Mr O'Byrne's contribution, saying he did not think five extra working days was an onerous ask. I do not think it is either. It was an entirely reasonable amendment [Bookmark: Phr18_O=218.7_D=26.3_C=0.79] . It is not my job to lecture the Labor Party on the motions it brings in here, but when it is asking for the tabling of documents, it is putting public servants under extreme pressure - public servants who have jobs to do as well as providing this information, and 24 hours' notice is not acceptable. 

This is another motion from Labor attempting to demonise something the government has put in place that I believe is entirely reasonable [Bookmark: Phr19_O=245.5_D=3.1_C=0.70] . The Labor Party has only so long that it can come into this place [Bookmark: Phr20_O=249.6_D=11.5_C=0.68] , complain about the debt the state is currently carrying, but then not articulate what it would do if it were on the government benches to rectify the situation. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=262.9_D=25.8_C=0.82]  At what point are they going to identify what money we have spent as a government during the COVID crisis and to deal with the commission of inquiry? What money would they not have spent that the government has spent? 

We know why we are carrying the debt we are. We also know we need to get back to balanced budgets and surplus budgets. However, we need to do that sensibly and progressively to make sure we do not damage [Bookmark: Phr22_O=289.0_D=15.9_C=0.80]  the very strong economy we have in Tasmania at the minute. We could jeopardise any number of jobs by rushing back to surplus. The Premier has made the comment in this place before that we could deliver a surplus budget this year, but it would not be a responsible budget. It would be a budget that would damage the Tasmanian economy overall and so, the efficiency dividend that we have put in place is an entirely sensible measure to make sure that we have the public service now that Tasmania needs, now and into the future, that it is fit for purpose and that it is delivering services as efficiently as possible.

I would say to the Labor Party that it is the height of hypocrisy to continually criticise the government's economic management, our budget performance, without being prepared to provide an alternative budget. I will not use the word 'kooky' to describe the Greens' budget because that is the word that gets used every time in this place, but -

Mr Willie - You just did.

Mr STREET - You are right, Mr Willie, I just did, but at least they are prepared to have the courage of their convictions. It has to be said that basically the Greens' alternative budget is to just cut all the funding for the things that they do not agree with to zero, pile it all into the things that they do support, and then declare the same bottom line as the government. However, they at least do it. They at least identify the areas that they do not support and are prepared to defund them.

What we get from Labor is the argument that we need to deliver more services, that we have a health crisis, that we have an education crisis, that we have a housing crisis, but that we are also carrying too much debt. It is then incumbent upon the Labor opposition to outline exactly what they would do policy-wise to rectify the situations that they believe exist within Tasmania, but also reduce debt at the same time because it cannot be done. It cannot be done.

They are converse arguments that they are trying to carry with the Tasmanian public and, much like they tried to do with the stadium during the election, where they told people who were supportive of the stadium, 'Oh look, this is just a little bit of a political play that we have to make to oppose the stadium, but really we support it,' and then after the election, they changed their position and supported the stadium.

They are trying to have two different conversations with the Tasmanian public at the same time. Inevitably, you get caught out when you try and tell two different stories on two different sides of the street. I say to the shadow treasurer: we look forward to seeing his alternative budget where he lays out the Labor Party's priorities, where they might point out the mistakes that we have made in terms of the money we have spent that they would not have spent.

We look forward to seeing them produce the figures to reduce the government's debt, while also spending more money in health, education and housing to rectify a situation that they have described in various times in this place as catastrophic and a crisis. We know that we have more work to do in all of those areas. We will deal with them sensibly and prudently. What we will not do is lie to the Tasmanian people and say you can spend more of the taxpayer's money while also reducing debt.

Our budget delivered on 29 May by the Treasurer will be a sensible budget. It will be a sensible pathway to surplus that does not damage the economic gains that we have made and, like I have said a couple of times during this contribution, we look forward to seeing what the Labor alternative to our budget is on 29 May, in the week after.

[3.31 p.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I thank members for their contributions. I mean that genuinely; everyone comes into this place with a different view of how things should be done and that is fine. I will, by way of explanation, explain our vote on the amendment. The member for Franklin made some reasonable arguments about paragraph (4) of the motion, and in the spirit of collaboration, given that he had indicated he would support the motion, I decided that we would not oppose the government's amendment for an increase in timeframe. I am a reasonable person and that is an explanation on that vote. I look forward to the information being provided if the motion is successful.

The Treasurer talking about economic growth: he is quoting some figures, but we do know that a lot of that economic growth is underpinned by debt-funded public spending. It is not just me pointing that out; Saul Eslake has pointed that out, too. He talked a bit about small business and business confidence. What businesses need is certainty and predictability, and when a government says it is going to do something, it actually happens within the timeframe they are talking about. There is no greater example of that than the Spirits debacle, where you had businesses that were investing in their business, they were being told there was going to be increased capacity in the economy, and what happened? The ships had no port to operate from. That hurts business confidence when the government is unpredictable and it cannot deliver stability or predictability and they cannot get those fundamentals right at the moment.

I was surprised that the Treasurer wanted to bring up the federal Budget. We just had the Labor Party comprehensively be returned to government and the mess that they were left by the federal Liberal Party, a trillion dollars' worth of debt with not much to show for it. They have actually improved the set of figures at a national level on what was left to them by the Liberal Party.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my right, nobody interjected on you except each other so allow the member to be heard in silence.

Mr WILLIE - That was good for me, Honourable Speaker, not to interject.

The SPEAKER - I am very proud of you, Mr Willie. If only it may long continue.

Do you have a point of order or are you just standing?

Mr SHELTON - Point of order: members should tell the truth in here.

Mr WILLIE - I am telling the truth.

Mr SHELTON - When you say, 'spent millions of dollars' without anything to prove -

The SPEAKER - The member will resume his seat. The member, as a former speaker, knows that that is not a point of order. If the member wishes to make a substantive allegation of misleading the House, he may do so through the appropriate forms.

Mr Willie has the call.

Mr WILLIE - What I was saying is that the federal Labor Party was returned comprehensively for their budget management. They inherited an absolute mess from the federal Liberal Party. It seems to be history repeating in Tasmania. The state's finances have never been worse and the Liberals in Tasmania have form when it comes to state debt. That is Tasmania's history.

It has often been Labor governments that have had to get the budget back into shape throughout Tasmania's history, so I was very surprised that he wanted to bring up budget management. The Liberal brand has been trashed all over the country in terms of budget management. You had Colin Barnett in Western Australia. There are many Australians now who know that myth of economic responsibility from the Liberals just does not exist. It is a complete myth and they have demonstrated that through their actions time and time again.

I, too, like the Treasurer, thank public servants for their hard work. They are working under extraordinary circumstances at the moment, a lot of challenges, and what does not help them is cuts to the budget because the budget has not been managed well. I have said this to the Treasurer in a number of forums: if you do not manage the budget well, you cannot invest in health and you cannot invest in education in the way that Tasmanians deserve.

We talked about productivity and the federal Treasurer. We agree with that. Productivity, participation and population are some of the fundamentals of economics and they are key challenges for the Tasmanian economy.

He talks a bit about GBE reform. It is interesting he wanted to mention that too, given the ferry fiasco. It was actually Dean Winter, me and other members of the Labor Party who put together a policy document for GBE reform. We announced that. What did the Liberal Party do at the time? They criticised it as 'more red tape'. What ended up happening about a month later? They copied most of it.

It was interesting you wanted to mention that as well.

The Treasurer went through a number of parameters and I thank him for that. I did speak about that on the amendment.

We had Mr Bayley; thank you for his contribution. He was concerned about the budget position. He echoed thoughts about efficiency dividends being lazy measures and that we need transparency for those.

He had concern about the pathway to surplus and at the time the Treasurer was interjecting about that. The Treasurer will try to talk about a pathway to surplus in the next Budget. There is no doubt about that; he is already doing it. Even if he gets close to a net operating balance surplus, it does not necessarily stop the debt. He needs a cash surplus to stabilise the debt. The debt for Tasmania is actually in freefall. It will continue ballooning until this government can get a cash surplus. That is when it will stabilise and that is a key test for him.

We had Mr Shelton try to explain away Tasmania's population challenges. That is a concern. This is a major challenge for Tasmania. We have had nine consecutive quarters of negative interstate migration. It is not something that you can explain away. We need to make sure that there are working-age people in Tasmania contributing to the economy, contributing their skills, and also paying taxes to deliver the services we all rely upon. You can try to explain away population growth, but that is a key concern, I believe. It is about confidence in the state.
	
	He said that the government is prudent in its spending. If you are nearly $10 billion in debt in the forward estimates and that is 'prudent spending', I would hate to see what reckless spending is under the government. It would be far, far worse. Prudent spending is not getting yourself into $10 billion worth of debt.
	
	Then we had the member for Franklin come and make a contribution. It is always fascinating that those on that side are very focused on what the Labor Party is doing. I will tell you what Tasmanians care about: they care about the actual Tasmanian budget that delivers the services and economy they need. They do not care about these silly games that get played each year around budget time.
	
	It is pretty telling that it is only the Liberal Party that carries on like this around this time of the year. They are elected to govern. You should be focusing on governing and improving outcomes for Tasmanians. We unfortunately were not able to form government. The opposition's role is to hold the government to account. They do not like it. They do not like the focus being on them and being held to account, so they try to create distractions rather than being focused on the job. I am sure we are going to have that debate this afternoon.
	
	That said, we will outline a number of measures this year. We are serious about being fiscally responsible. This government has lost its way. It cannot continue. It is about the future of the state. I have young children myself. It is about future generations being saddled with this government's debt. We will start to outline our plan for government, and we take that responsibility very seriously. We will not be dictated to by a Liberal Party that has completely trashed the state's finances. They have no credibility now when it comes to managing the economy or the budget. We will not play their silly games. They should be focused on Tasmanians and governing the state.
	
	I will leave it there. I thank members for their contribution again and I look forward to the vote.
	
	Motion, as amended, agreed to.
	
	
WAIVER OF PRIVATE MEMBERS TIME
	
	The SPEAKER - The debate having been concluded, does the member wish to waive the remainder of the time? You have 14 minutes.
	
	Mr WILLIE - Yes.
	
	
MOTION

Minister for Business, Industry and Resources -Referral to Privileges and Conduct Committee
	
[3.41 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, a vote will be required. I move -

That the House refers the Minister for Business, Industry and Resources, the Hon. Eric Abetz MP, to the Privileges and Conduct Committee to investigate and report upon whether he deliberately misrepresented the MinterEllison Stadium representation to the Tasmanian Planning Commission as being impartial legal advice and legal opinion, and whether or not this is a breach of the Code of Conduct contained in the Standing Orders of the House of Assembly.

This is a serious issue and we certainly do not take a referral to Privileges lightly. Such is the severity of this issue in our minds that we are taking this action and are seeking the support of the House for this motion and for the referral of the minister to the Privileges Committee.

I will take a moment to remind the House that this motion is not seeking a finding of guilt. This is not a censure. This is not a no-confidence motion. This is a referral to Privileges. While we Greens are convinced,  and I will lay out, that the minister has repeatedly misled the public and the parliament, all in a transparent attempt to construct a justification for abandoning the stadium POSS process and orchestrating a parliamentary approval for the Macquarie Point Stadium, despite its so many flaws, here in this place you need not be convinced of that. You may not be convinced of that and that should not preclude you from supporting this motion. It is the job of the Privileges and Conduct Committee to investigate and hear the evidence, to deliberate on the context and circumstance and to adjudicate on the question of misleading [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.6_D=24.4_C=0.77] , and thus consistency with the Tasmanian parliament members' code of conduct. 

Via this motion I am simply seeking a referral. It is the committee's job to judge and that is an important distinction. I remind the House of our obligations under the Code of Conduct:

A member must only make statements in parliament and in public that are, to the best of their knowledge, accurate and honest. [Bookmark: Phr3_O=55.6_D=26.5_C=0.76]  

A member must not mislead Parliament or the public in statements that they make. 

Whether any misleading was intentional or unintentional, a Member is obliged to correct the Parliamentary record, or the public record, at the earliest opportunity in a manner that is appropriate to the circumstances. 

Two days ago, I wrote to the minister laying out our concerns with regards to his public and parliamentary statements and calling on him to correct the parliamentary and the public record. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=83.1_D=2.8_C=0.48]  While I have provided a copy of the letter to members [Bookmark: Phr5_O=86.3_D=7.8_C=0.82] , I will take the time to read it into Hansard. 

Dear Minister, 

I write regarding recent statements you have made in the media and Parliament [Bookmark: Phr6_O=94.4_D=25.9_C=0.82] . In seeking to manufacture a pretence for your government to bypass the Tasmanian Planning Commission and fast-track approval of the stadium through special legislation, you have knowingly misled the Tasmanian public and the parliament. You have made objectively misleading and dishonest statements to characterise an argumentative submission made to the Planning Commission as being 'legal advice' and impartial 'legal opinion'. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=120.9_D=3.4_C=0.72]  That has been provided to the Macquarie Point Development Corporation [Bookmark: Phr8_O=124.8_D=26.5_C=0.75]  (MPDC).

In Parliament on 9 April, you said, 

That is where the MinterEllison legal opinion is so strong and so robust. It might be a multinational firm, but does that in any way, shape or form undermine the robustness and integrity of the legal opinion? Not at all. Indeed, Mr Bayley could not lay a glove on it for very good reason, because it is robust, it is good, it stands for itself and it is obvious.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=152.0_D=5.7_C=0.71] On 14 April, the minister told ABC Mornings program:

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=158.1_D=10.8_C=0.81] MinterEllison have provided a very robust legal advice to the Macquarie Point Development Corporation in which they said the report contains errors of law, approach and analysis.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=170.6_D=22.6_C=0.78] Both these statements are dishonest and inaccurate. As you know, law firm MinterEllison has been acting on behalf of Macquarie Point Development Corporation through the Project of State Significance assessment process. Immediately following the release of the Planning Commission's draft Integrated Assessment Report, MinterEllison collaborated with the Government to draft a submission to the Commission as part of its consultation process. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=193.9_D=24.6_C=0.74]  This submission, known in Law as a representation is, by its own description, an argument made on behalf of Macquarie Point Development Corporation to further its own agenda and make its case within the stadium statutory assessment process. It is not impartial legal advice or opinion. Far from it. In fact, DPAC and the Macquarie Point Development Corporation themselves had a direct hand in writing parts of this submission.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=219.4_D=3.4_C=0.72] You have made the statements I have quoted in the full knowledge they are misleading. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=223.4_D=29.7_C=0.83]  In reference to this representation you told ABC Stateline: 'as a lawyer myself, having read that opinion, I thought it was robust.' As a lawyer, your acknowledgement of having read this representation establishes that you cannot plead ignorance on this matter. No lawyer would be ignorant or incompetent enough to not know the basic and fundamental difference between a representation made to further a proponent's case in a statutory assessment process and impartial legal advice. 

Given the above [Bookmark: Phr15_O=253.2_D=29.4_C=0.77] , it is clear you have knowingly misled Parliament and the public by deliberately misrepresenting the MinterEllison letter as legal advice. You have done this to further your government's goal of undermining public trust in the independent expert panel conducting the stadium's assessment and to build the case for an extraordinary political intervention through a corrupted legislative approval process. As Leader of Government Business in the House of Assembly, you should be well aware your conduct is in breach of the Standing Orders of the Tasmanian Parliament.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=282.9_D=22.0_C=0.82] Further Standing Orders, I call on you to correct the parliamentary and public record. We expect you to do so prior to Question Time on Tuesday, May 6 - 

That was yesterday.

Failure to do so will leave the Greens no choice but to pursue accountability through the Parliament. 

Yours sincerely,
Vica Bayley MP.

Here we are. The Minister failed to address the issue and I am here seeking your support to refer him to Privileges. 

Before I go into the substance of the issue and why it needs to be investigated, I will outline that the threshold for referral is not necessarily all that high, according to some.

On 15 April on WIN News, the member for Bass, Mr Ferguson, was reported as saying that he will write to the Privileges Committee and the Speaker of the House regarding the conduct of a former member of this place, Ms Rebecca White. This was because of his concern about Ms White's public statements that former federal member for Lyons, Brian Mitchell, supported her nomination. Mr Mitchell did not support Ms White publicly, but seemingly also sought preselection and thus was eligible for compensation as a sitting member not preselected to contest the seat in last week's election. For Mr Ferguson, this was evidence of a mistruth and justified action by the Privileges and Conduct Committee.

The most recent actual referral to Privileges - minister Barnett as Energy minister in September 2023, had significantly more substance. Minister Barnett failed to adhere to an order of the House to provide members updated cost estimates for Marinus Link, the North West Transmission Developments and the Battery of the Nation projects. More recently, just a few weeks ago, while not a referral to Privileges, there was a no-confidence advance in minister Duigan by the opposition. It has to be said, that motion relied significantly on hearsay and subjective analysis and advice, and it lacked evidence. It failed. 

In this case it is very clear that minister Abetz did not fully comply with the order that we as this House passed, including the amendments that the Labor Party introduced into this motion. We are not seeking redress for that in this case. We do not feel as if the minister fully complied with the order. The Labor Party passed an amendment to the motion that asked them to articulate the reasons why they would not release the information that was requested. They did not release all the information that was requested and they did not give us the reasons for that, but the information that was released was telling. By its own admission, the package of information tabled in parliament only addressed the first of four requests within the order. There was no justification for the withholding of information as requested by Mr Willie in his amendment.

The information we did get was damning enough. It demonstrated that the board of the Macquarie Point Development Corporation and the head of the State Service directly inputted into the representation submitted to the Tasmanian Planning Commission by law firm MinterEllison. MinterEllison has been engaged by the Macquarie Point Development Corporation since last year. This representation showed that there was direct involvement in writing it by agents of government.

To recap, on 31 March, in line with its statutory timelines, at 4.00 p.m. the TPC published its draft integrated assessment report for the Macquarie Point stadium. The report is damning. Whether it is the costs overshadowing benefits; traffic and pedestrian issues; flooding; impacts on heritage values, including the otherwise sacred Cenotaph; emergency evacuation; or site contamination and waste disposal; the TPC has raised a litany of issues associated with the stadium, many of which cannot be mitigated by design adjustments or conditions. The impact on the Cenotaph is case in point. The stadium will have an impact on the Cenotaph, the values of the Cenotaph and the ambience of the Cenotaph. That cannot be addressed. They cannot be designed away and they cannot be conditioned away.

By 3 April, the Macquarie Point Development Corporation had published a media statement and publicly released a representation to the TPC consultation process addressed to the TPC on MinterEllison letterhead. By its own admission, the letter is the first of three representations that the commission were told it could expect. This is important. The representation is a defence of the Macquarie Point Development Corporation's case and a push back on the planning commission. We do not have a problem with the representation, as it is the right of the proponent to make a representation into that space. Where it does go wrong, though, is that it seeks to undermine the credibility of the planning commission and its report. I quote directly from that representation:

The draft IAR does not comply with the requirements of the State Policies and Projects Act. It contains errors of law, approach and analysis. It is argumentative and lacks balance to support the making of representations. It should be given limited, if any, weight.

Documents released in that parliamentary order demonstrate that this claim and this context is exactly what the government agents and stadium proponents injected into the representation. The document release has a draft of the representation and an email communication demonstrating feedback, including via a track change document and email input from the head of the State Service.

Let me read into Hansard some of this correspondence. This is from Anne Beach, the CEO of Macquarie Point Development Corporation, to the lawyer at 6.29 p.m. on Wednesday 2 April: 

Thanks, Josh. Attached are the tracked amendments we have just worked through with the board. Thank you for joining the meeting at short notice. Can you please review and send through a final this evening for our final review and for submission by Minters tomorrow morning? 

Thanks for your help, 
Anne.

Then another one, from the head of the State Service, no less, Kathrine Morgan-Wicks. This was at 9.48 p.m. on the same day, Wednesday 2 April. It is an email to a whole raft of people, including the lawyer, the author of the representation. It says, amongst other things, a few typos and corrections:

3.2b, it goes beyond the state economy. It questions the validity of government budget and investment, debt, decisions and corresponding impacts on credit rating. Perhaps something like - 

And then she produces a paragraph:

'The discussion and assessment of the business and investment case, which appears to extend to matters of the state economy, budget decisions, total state sector debt and credit rating, including the alternative use of funds, is irrelevant and beyond the reasonable scope of economic considerations for the purposes of an assessment under the SPP Act and the objectives of the resource management and planning system.'

This, of course, can be picked up in the representation too, if it is not too late. Thank you for the opportunity prior to release. 

Kind regards.

Of course, that whole paragraph, word for word, is included in the representation, which is completely fine, if it is a representation, but this is the distinction. It is the right of the proponent to input and to advocate its position. It might be aggressive, it might be intimidatory to have it submitted by a law firm on a law firm's letterhead, but it is not necessarily untoward.
The Tasmanian Planning Commission pushed back. They have written to the Macquarie Point Development Corporation four times now about these issues, once in January, another time on 8 April, another time on 15 April, and on 30 April they wrote again, requesting additional reports. I will read into Hansard a little bit of the email from the Planning Commission's chair, Mr John Ramsay, back to the lawyer from MinterEllison:

I refer to the MinterEllison representation of 3 April last on behalf of the Crown Right of Tasmania. The commission undertakes its assessment tasks in accordance with its legal obligations and responsibilities. The Macquarie Point Development Corporation has been aware of the commission's view of the scope of the assessment since the publication of the guidelines, and its view was subsequently confirmed to the Macquarie Point Development Corporation in my correspondence to the Macquarie Point Development Corporation of 22 January last.

Good on him. Good on Mr Ramsay for pushing back on this representation, because it is abundantly clear that the representation is little more than a vehicle for the Macquarie Point Development Corporation and now the government, through minister Abetz and indeed the Premier, to attack the integrity and credibility of the Planning Commission panel. This is where the representation, or the legal advice, as Mr Abetz has characterised it, comes in as being so important.

The distinction is really important. It may not look like a big deal to some from the outside. Representation, legal advice, legal opinion: what is the difference? It is on a legal firm's letterhead. Some people may see this and think that I am splitting hairs, but the reality is that this representation has been used for an unprecedented attack on the independence of the planning commission by the highest level of government in this state.

This is their own planning commission, within their own process, which the Premier himself came to this House to establish. Minister Abetz has been on ABC Stateline, on ABC Mornings and, indeed, has said this numerous times in the parliament. Together, minister Abetz, and indeed the Premier - but minister Abetz is who this motion is focused on - has questioned the integrity of the Tasmanian Planning Commission. He has called them biased and said they have an apprehended bias. This is slanderous if not defamatory. The TPC panel is comprised of experts. It has an ex-deputy solicitor-general, it has an ex-treasury boss, it has experts in planning and it has experts in administration [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=7.1_C=0.79] , and Mr Ramsay has been a chair of the Planning Commission for a long time. This is why this is so critical.

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=38.0_D=25.2_C=0.81] Claiming this representation is legal advice, with its government-led criticisms of the TPC, is the basis upon which the government is trying to attempt to take down the TPC and justify its special railroad legislation through this parliament. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=64.1_D=4.7_C=0.85]  Pointing to the representation as a reason to attack the Tasmanian Planning Commission [Bookmark: Phr5_O=69.1_D=29.2_C=0.85] , discount its report and the report's findings, and cook up justifications for special legislation is exactly what this government has been trying to do by passing it off as independent, impartial legal advice when it is anything but. It is a representation written by a lawyer with input from the proponent itself. The Premier, too - and this is where it gets despicable - the Premier too has engaged in this kind of behaviour  [Bookmark: Phr6_O=99.2_D=1.5_C=0.86] in a story in The Age [Bookmark: Phr7_O=102.5_D=28.6_C=0.73] , where the journalist paraphrases him saying - 

Rockliff, who hit out the report for failing to be independent, doubled down on his initial criticism.
It continues with a direct quote from the Premier -

My view is they went in there with a predetermined view. From my point of view, it wasn't objective.

That is a remarkable statement for a premier to make about the Planning Commission, about the experts on that panel, and about the way [Bookmark: Phr8_O=131.5_D=27.1_C=0.77]  they do their work. It is a cook-up that goes all the way to the top of this government and it is completely shameful. That is why this is really important. It is why language is really important. Minister Abetz waves around the representation and calls it legal advice. He calls it legal opinion. I will say again: in parliament, he said:

This is where the MinterEllison legal opinion is so strong and so robust.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=160.7_D=5.6_C=0.61] Calling it legal opinion when it is little more than a representation on behalf of [Bookmark: Phr10_O=167.6_D=29.5_C=0.75]  a client, on behalf of a proponent for a development, it is a representation. It is not independent legal advice. On 14 April, again I will read it in because it is really critical, minister Abetz told ABC Mornings:

MinterEllison have provided very robust legal advice to the Macquarie Point Development Corporation, in which they say the report contains errors of law, approach and analysis.

Again, I remind members that this is [Bookmark: Phr11_O=197.8_D=27.8_C=0.85]  not robust legal advice. This is a representation into a planning process that has had direct editing and track changes; it is a document coming from the proponent itself. It is not independent legal advice. It is not independent legal opinion. It is a representation, and I say again, it is a legitimate representation submitted by a lawyer on behalf of a proponent, but it is not legal advice and the distinction is really important. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=226.4_D=2.1_C=0.53]  A representation worked up with the proponent [Bookmark: Phr13_O=228.9_D=29.4_C=0.76]  is not independent legal advice and it is not even legal opinion.

Minister Abetz told ABC Stateline:

As a lawyer myself, having read that opinion, I thought it was robust. 

As a lawyer, it is clear to us that Minister Abetz has misled both the parliament and the public. Any lawyer should know that a representation into which the client, the proponent, has sent track changes [Bookmark: Phr14_O=258.6_D=29.8_C=0.86]  to be accepted by the lawyer as part of a submission should know that it is not legal advice, it is not legal opinion. Nevertheless, it has been waved around and used as a justification for a quite remarkable and despicable attack on the reputation, the integrity, the credibility and the ability indeed of individuals and a statutory authority here in this state. It is clear to us that minister Abetz has misled [Bookmark: Phr15_O=288.8_D=10.7_C=0.85]  both the parliament and the public. However, I say again: it does not need to be clear to you as members. All you need to be convinced about is that there is a case to answer here. [Bookmark: Phr16_O=300.2_D=4.7_C=0.81]  You only need to understand that this is looking really fishy, that it looks really dodgy to be waving around a track change document and calling it legal advice. Ultimately, it is the job of the Privileges and Conduct Committee to really dig into this issue, to call forward witnesses, to investigate, to get proper legal advice about the status and ultimately to make a decision.

We have seen, through the Spirits fiasco, that this government is prone to making bad decisions and trying to cover them up, trying to get away with them and they just dig themselves deeper into a hole.

It is the same when it comes to the stadium. Yes, the Labor Party is now backing the stadium. It is now going to back the government's legislation, but that does not mean you need to back a minister misrepresenting evidence, misrepresenting a representation into a planning process and trying to pass it off as legal advice, trying to pass it off as some kind of impartial, objective, legal opinion that then undermines the credibility of the entire planning commission. 

We believe this is a critically important issue for the House to take a stand on to make sure that this minister is referred to the Privileges and Conduct Committee for investigation. Prima facie the minister has misled both this parliament and the public. Prima facie he has breached the code of conduct and it is the job of the Privileges and Conduct Committee to have a good close, hard look at that so that this government, which makes a virtue out of misinformation, out of mistruths, out of deception, and out of obfuscation, is held to account; so that ultimately this parliament says that this is not good enough and they should not go on anymore. 

This is not independent legal advice or opinion. This is a political document submitted to a planning process by a proponent for a billion-dollar-plus project, and minister Abetz should be held to account for misrepresenting it. The government as a whole should be held to account for using that cooked-up pretence as a mechanism to attack the planning commission, attack its integrity, attack its work and ultimately abandon, it seems, the POSS process in lieu of a fast-track parliamentary assessment process where the government sits in a room and workshops with the EPA and other agencies to work out conditions. This is a travesty in the making. It is a trainwreck of immense proportions happening day by day and bad decision by bad decision. The least we in this place can do is try to hold ministers to account for the things they do and say, and refer minister Abetz to Privileges for them to look deeply into this issue. It is absolutely justified, it is absolutely necessary, and I urge all members to support this motion.

[4.06 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Motions such as this demean the currency of referring people to the Privileges and Conduct Committee, but what do we get from the Greens in this place? Yesterday, it was a no-confidence motion in the Premier. Thankfully, it spectacularly failed. Today's stunt is to try to refer me to the Privileges and Conduct Committee. The Greens are losing credibility day after day by wasting the time of this parliament on stunts of this nature. 

It was quite sleazy in the debate for the proponent of this motion to suggest you do not really have to consider the detail, just flick past it to the Privileges and Conduct Committee for them to examine it. We have not really made a judgment.

Well, unfortunately, by reading out the letter that he wrote to me, it is indicative of the fact that a judgment had been made and a very condemnatory one as well. However, what I would say to all members in this place is this: before you refer somebody to the Privileges and Conduct Committee you need to have smoking gun. In this case, no smoke, no gun, no nothing. What is the accusation? That I have deliberately misrepresented the MinterEllison stadium representation as being impartial legal opinion. When have I ever said it is impartial? Never. When have I ever said it is independent legal opinion? Never. The very motion that seeks to accuse me of a deliberate misrepresentation deliberately misrepresents me and what I said -

Dr Woodruff - I would have thought objectivity is about independence. 

Mr ABETZ - No matter what the Greens leader's interjection might be, which I am not interested in, it is a gross manufacturing of a complaint which is disingenuous in its entirety because what it asserts is something the deputy leader of the Greens has failed to establish -

Dr Woodruff - Do not go to the substance, will you?

Mr ABETZ - Indeed, his very long letter to me -

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff, this is your only warning. Mr Bayley was heard for 27 minutes in absolute silence and every other speaker to this motion will be given the same respect.

Mr ABETZ - Thank you, deputy Speaker. When you are accused of dishonesty and a few other things on the way through, it is somewhat difficult not to interject. 

In the quotes the Deputy Leader of the Greens relies on in his letter, not once am I quoted as saying 'impartial' or 'independent.' You have misled this House by your motion, Mr Bayley. You stand condemned for so misleading, for trying to say to the public that this is what I did.

What I said was this is legal opinion. What a surprise. Legal letterhead, MinterEllison. Google them. They are a law firm. Look at the signature block: three lawyers are mentioned. Guess what lawyers do? Lawyers might be legal representatives, they make legal representations. When we have statements such as 'it contains errors of law' in between the letterhead and the signatures of that letter, might that just be a legal opinion? I would have thought that is a legal opinion in anybody's language. Agree with it, disagree with it by all means but, unless you live in the parallel universe the Greens do, this is legal opinion. 

Further, the draft IAR does not comply with the requirements of the SPP act. Guess what? That is a legal opinion provided by lawyers - lawyers that act for the MPDC. Yes, as a former lawyer, I looked at that and thought: 'This letter is robust.' There is intellectual integrity in it, a persuasiveness about it that attracted me to it. That is why I have made reference to it and I will continue to make reference to it, uncomfortable as it might for those on the Greens benches, who, in the past, did not want the POSS process and now, because they see it as a vehicle for potentially derailing the stadium, all of a sudden embrace the POSS process. 

Not only do they come into this debate with a forked tongue and degree of duplicity, they also grossly misrepresent that which has been said and, in doing so, try to assert that I am guilty. Where is the evidence that I said 'impartial' or 'independent'? It does not exist. The letter from Mr Bayley confirms that I did not say, and yet he mischievously puts that into the motion to try to sucker in some of his colleagues in this place. I would like to think they are going to be a bit smarter than that sort of deceptive motion and I trust that they will not be voting for it. 

If anybody else needed evidence, Anne Beach, the CEO of the Macquarie Point Development Corporation (MPDC), said in a media release on 3 April that the corporation had received 'legal advice' in relation to the report. Guess what? That is this letter to which I referred. The CEO of the MPDC says it is legal advice. Prima facie, it is self-evident that this is legal opinion. It says it contains error of law. I suppose, according to the Greens, that is a medical opinion. Or is it an accounting opinion? I would have thought most people would accept that as a legal opinion. For me to represent this letter as legal opinion is somehow a matter for referral. Quite frankly, I do not get it. Until you realise that, whilst I was engaged in the sleep of the innocents at 10.04 p.m. the other evening, the Greens were there in their cauldron concocting this letter, stirring up vitriol and misinformation -

Dr Woodruff - Working hard.

Mr ABETZ - and I received this email. My poor inbox received this pollution of a letter from the deputy leader of the Greens making all sorts of assertions, 'blatantly dishonest', et cetera. I do not know why, but at 10.04 p.m., there must have been a rush of blood to the head. However, he must now realise that he completely overstated his case. That is why he has backed off in this motion and in his plea to this House. He is saying, 'No longer do I believe that he necessarily was so grossly dishonest, et cetera', which I patently was not. I faithfully represented this letter. My public statements of this letter did not in any way, shape or form misrepresent the letter. I seek to be straightforward with the Tasmanian people to the best of my ability and not misrepresent the information provided to me.

In this letter that my poor inbox received at 10:04 pm that unfortunate evening, Mr Bayley accuses me of saying that it was impartial legal opinion not once, not twice, but three times. Very sleazily, he says 'impartial' - the inverted commas start after the word 'impartial', which confirms I never said it. However, your motion says that is what I said. You can foolishly laugh, Leader of the Greens, but that does not cover up the misinformation in the motion and the mischief you are seeking to put before this place. 

The deputy leader of the Greens is a bit like a dropped pie: he is all over the shop. At one time, he tries to say that I grossly misled, and then, 'Oh well, let us allow the committee to make a determination whether he possibly did. We are not really condemning him. This is not a hanging offence, but, yes, my letter said it was.' That is a complete and utter step-down, I think because Mr Bayley realises that his letter overstated it. Whoever wrote the letter - and I have my suspicion as to who it might have been, I just hope the legal advice provided for that was on a pro bono basis because it would only be worth every cent if it was on a pro bono basis. Namely, absolutely worthless. I trust the Greens paid no money in relation to this astounding letter. 

Let us be clear: a representation made to the TPC can quite properly include legal opinion and legal representations. Many a time when, in a previous life, I made representations to tribunals, it contained a bit of legal advice, legal opinion, it had dispute over the facts. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=26.4_D=4.7_C=0.82]  You range over a whole host of issues, but I come back once again [Bookmark: Phr3_O=31.8_D=15.4_C=0.75] . This letter actually does have legal opinion in it. It says an error of law was made by a legal firm, signed off by a lawyer who is a King's Counsel, no less.  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=50.9_D=29.3_C=0.80] This is the complete ignorance of the Deputy Leader of the Greens, or wilful misleading. Guess what lawyers do? This is a revelation to the parliament. Lawyers represent their clients: revelation no. 1. 

Therefore, in drafting correspondence, you want to check, as a lawyer, that the representation you are making [Bookmark: Phr5_O=80.7_D=25.6_C=0.75]  is in line with the instructions from your client. Therefore, that there is to-ing and fro-ing between the client and the legal firm, and there might be tracked changes, quite frankly, is no revelation. The fact that the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Greens think this is such a great revelation and that this must undoubtedly expose corruption [Bookmark: Phr6_O=106.8_D=8.6_C=0.61]  just shows that there is no understanding of the way of the world. Might I add, I am sure that from time to time [Bookmark: Phr7_O=116.2_D=28.4_C=0.74]  when - and I will take a punt here - Browne and FitzGerald write letters for and on behalf of the Greens, before it gets sent, there might be tracked changes or telephone conversations as to particular words or wording in that correspondence to make sure it complies with the instructions of the Greens. That is the way it works [Bookmark: Phr8_O=145.2_D=9.8_C=0.66]  and that is the way it used to work when I was a lawyer. It continues to work that way for everybody in this space.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=155.6_D=27.5_C=0.84] Can I say that in my previous life, many a time I stood on my feet to be defence counsel, never considering that one day I might be standing in this place being defence counsel for myself. Can I say that this would have to be, I believe, the easiest case that I have ever been asked to defend [Bookmark: Phr10_O=183.5_D=26.2_C=0.85] , because as I said, there is no smoke, there is no gun, there is nothing whatsoever and the allegation is a falsehood. Quite frankly, I would have to say to the Deputy Leader of the Greens, it disappoints me that you would say and import words into the motion [Bookmark: Phr11_O=211.1_D=24.3_C=0.85]  that I never uttered, never said, never represented - namely that it was impartial legal advice. Indeed, if I were so minded, I could refer this motion to the Privileges Committee for deliberately misleading this House [Bookmark: Phr12_O=236.2_D=3.2_C=0.65] . I think my colleagues are too smart [Bookmark: Phr13_O=239.9_D=9.6_C=0.70]  and therefore have not been misled because they know the ruse, they know the tactics of the Greens, and they hopefully will not be [Bookmark: Phr14_O=252.5_D=29.5_C=0.82]  conned by this motion.

I completely and utterly reject the assertion that I have misled, let alone deliberately misled, or that I have been dishonest in relation to this matter. I seek, to the very best of my ability in public life, to ensure that that which I put on the public record is the truth. There is no doubt [Bookmark: Phr15_O=282.4_D=18.4_C=0.83] , given the letter from MinterEllison, given the media release from the Macquarie Point Development Corporation, that I have faithfully represented and honestly represented that which is contained in the correspondence. I trust the House rejects the motion.

[4.22 p.m.]
Dr BROAD (Braddon) - Deputy Speaker, I think that was a little bit amusing, at least. Before I start on the substance, I have to say that I do not have any legal training, although I did do a week's work experience, when I was in high school, at a law firm. That probably put me off going down the track of becoming a lawyer. That was with Little, Walsh and Day from Ulverstone, a legal firm there. You would know Mike Walsh? 

Mr Abetz - I do.

Dr BROAD - I met Mike Walsh some years later and reminded him of my week's work experience. He said, 'Did it put you off?' and I had to be honest and say, 'Yes, it did.'

Mr Abetz - And look where you have ended up.

Dr BROAD - Here I am today, and I am going to start talking about legal opinions and so on. Anyway, I digress.

I have to say that sending a member to Privileges is actually a serious matter. We need to take this very seriously, and there also must be a very strong case. What is the charge? The charge is that the honourable Eric Abetz MP deliberately misrepresented the MinterEllison stadium representation to the Tasmanian Planning Commission as being impartial legal advice and legal opinion, therefore is in effective breach of the Code of Conduct. That is the charge.

Okay, Mr Abetz. You are so charged. I listened quite intently to the member for Clark, Mr Bayley's allegations and the reasoning for making this very serious charge. He helpfully gave me a briefing document, including the original letter that was sent to the honourable Eric Abetz. It quotes a couple of places' statements, to provide the evidence of misleading, where it refers to MinterEllison's legal opinion and MinterEllison has provided very robust legal advice.

I notice in all the briefing papers and in that letter, for example, and indeed in the member for Franklin, Mr Abetz's comments, the interchangeable use of opinion and advice. This is an issue which has been grinding on me, so I had to look it up:

A legal opinion is an attorney's analysis based on past or present facts, while legal advice is an attorney's counsel and guidance as to what future actions the client should take.

Maybe there is a distinction between opinion and advice, but I digress again. I would just like to point out that if this letter was drafted by a lawyer, I think the interchangeable use of those two terms is maybe problematic. 

What evidence do the Greens have that MinterEllison is not impartial? Is that actually relevant? The to-and-fro between clients is actually common. I know this is common. I will give an example: my first job out of university after my undergraduate degree was working in the water management branch, where my job was to bring in the existing rights - they were called prescriptive rights - they had to be brought in to the new water management legislation that passed in 1999. For example, farmers who were given an allocation of half the river, that had to be quantified and it had to be brought under the new system. 

Because the legislation had passed and we were uncertain on how to do it, I needed to get legal advice, and in times that was from Crown Law. Indeed, there was to-and-fro between me, the department and Crown Law as to, what is the meaning of this, did you mean that, and so on and so forth. For anybody who has had interactions with lawyers, to-and-fro is quite common.

I would strongly believe that if it is on letterhead from a law firm, then it is legal opinion regardless. The reason why the law firm has to stand behind it, because it is their reputation on the line. If it is on their letterhead, they have to be satisfied that they are willing to put their reputation on the line, to provide that document to the client for the client to use. Sometimes the client may be limited in how they can use that. Maybe that is part of what the law firm says, you can use this opinion in these circumstances and none other, but that is sort of irrelevant as well. If it is on legal letterhead, then I do not see the argument as to how that is not a legal opinion and one that that law firm has to stand behind. The arguments otherwise are a bit silly.

Whether the opinion would stand up in court or legal challenge is a completely different matter. That is why we have lawyers, that is why we have courts, that is why we have legal process - because opinion can be challenged. This opinion can be challenged, absolutely, but the charge is that it was being misrepresented as being, in effect, not legal advice or legal opinion. I just do not see how that charge is substantiated in the Greens' arguments, and indeed, their letters and everything that was provided to me.

I must say, having a crack at planning experts appointed as part of the POSS process is not a good look. It is definitely not a good look. It does seek to undermine the planning commission, but it is still legal advice.

We are not debating whether the member is undermining POSS, really, or the planning commission. The charge is one of misrepresentation. You are arguing that Mr Abetz has misrepresented - not that his argument is complete garbage and that he is having a crack at POSS and it is unjustified; that is not your charge. If your charge was to send him to Privileges for undermining the POSS process, then maybe we would be having a different argument. You have alleged simply that he has misrepresented the document from MinterEllison as being legal advice. I do not think that charge can also be substantiated.

Having said that, I would also add that undermining the credibility and/or independence of the public servants is actually the Greens' stock and trade. The hypocrisy here is quite large. 

I will give you a couple of examples. One of my first weeks in this parliament, I saw the absolute machine-gunning of the reputations of the then Marine Farming Review Panel. Cassy O'Connor stood and just machine-gunned the reputations of every member of the Marine Farming Review Panel. Subsequently, the independence of the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) is constantly questioned, the Forest Practices Authority. More recently, there were questions about what Public Health and Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania (NRET) were saying about salmon, as well as the EPA.

I do not think the Greens are actually on moral high ground when it comes to having a go at the reputations of public servants and the independence of public organisations, public bodies, because they do this all the time. The hypocrisy there is writ large.

I do not believe that this case against Mr Abetz is substantiated in any way. Who would not love sending Eric Abetz to Privileges? Indeed, I would be going to Labor meetings and getting pats on my back, I can tell you that. If there was a sliver of a good argument here, I would definitely be taking it up just to get some free beers at the next Labor conference. However, I do not believe that it is substantiated.

Again, I would add that I believe this week the Greens' political radar is well and truly broken. We have seen the Greens get absolutely poleaxed federally. More recently, only just in the last few minutes, it has been confirmed that their leader Adam Bandt has been sent packing. He has lost his position, so the federal Greens are completely leaderless, and it appears that the Tasmanian Greens are completely rudderless when it comes to their political tactics. We saw that yesterday with a poorly timed motion of no confidence in the Premier, and today with a legal argument that just does not hold up.

I will not waste much more of the parliament's time on this, so I will summarise. In summary: Is MinterEllison a legal firm? Yes. Is the document with MinterEllison's letterhead legal opinion? Yes. Therefore, it is not a misrepresentation. Case closed.

[4.32 p.m.]
Mr FERGUSON (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to do two things here this afternoon: first, defend my colleague, the Leader of the House, minister Abetz, in relation to this puerile attack from the Greens party; and acknowledge that the opposition, which rarely misses an opportunity to play its own cheap politics -
Dr Broad - Be nice.

Mr FERGUSON - has today given a very responsible position, as put forward by Dr Broad. No doubt there has been a discussion in the Labor Party about whether we might fall for the allure, the temptation to run with a process which would publicly try to smear a Liberal minister; they have not done that.

Mr Farrell - We can do that in parliament.

Mr FERGUSON - We know you do. We recognise that. I want to make a few comments about the importance of the forms of this House that are being played with by the Greens today. I acknowledge Dr Broad's contribution and I thank him, Mr Winter, and their party for adopting that position. I really appreciate it; I see it as responsible. Whether it was a minority government scenario or a majority government scenario, I spent eight years in the seat that Mr Abetz occupies as Leader of the House and I always maintained a relationship with the equivalent on the other side because there were some things that needed to remain above politics. I often would say to Mr O'Byrne, when he was in that chair, to Mr Winter when he was in that chair, though perhaps not yourself, Dr Broad, but I always said we take our turns in this House. The Liberal party will not always be in government. The Labor party will not always be in opposition.

If that serves the point, we need to observe the character of this House's best traditions and reserve processes like sending ministers - or, by the way, a non-minister - to the Privileges and Conduct Committee for genuinely serious cases. If you do not do that, you cheapen the form of the House that you are trying to utilise, which is what I am witnessing today. It makes me angry that the Greens are doing this at all and wasting 90 minutes of the House's time.

If I had a sense that this motion would pass here today, because the Labor Party or enough of the other people would support it, I would say the same thing. I hope that I would have the courage and the grace to say that if it was a member of a different party under the same kind of puerile attack that I am witnessing here this afternoon. I would certainly be arguing it in my party room if a similar attack was being launched against Mr Winter or Mr Jenner or any other member of this House that is not in the government. I hope that I would have the courage and the grace in my party room to argue that we should oppose this because it cheapens the form of the House that is supposed to be reserved for those rare, unusual and despicable cases where a member of the House, minister or not, has flagrantly breached the code of conduct which we have all signed up to.

It is Wednesday. It is private members' time. Is it not the case that every Wednesday there are opportunities for members of this House who are not ministers to be able to raise issues of concern to them, their party or their electorate? We have seen some tremendous utilisations of private members' time in this House in the 15 years that I have served as a member. Things that I have agreed with, things that I have not agreed with, but they have been able to be brought forward to the Floor of this House to represent a genuine issue in the constituency, a genuine need to change a law - a minor or a major change to the law - or even perhaps an accountability measure for somebody who has prima facie seemed to have done the wrong thing and ought to be brought to account.

I can say, and I do not intend to elaborate, I have seen cases where ministers or others have been referred to various processes of the Privileges Committee, now it is known as the Privileges and Conduct Committee, where there was a prima facie case for that to be dealt with at that forum, but they are very rare. When I served on that side of the House, on the opposition benches, between '10 and '14, I was interested that, at that time, I learned and understood that the Privileges Committee, as it was then known, had a majority of members from the government. I remember thinking to myself, 'Gee, we place a lot of trust in the government'.

The government placed itself on that committee in such numbers to more or less - I will use the word 'manage' it, control it. Unless someone can correct me, I do not believe there was a single occasion during that period, by the way, of a Labor-Greens government error where I saw the Privileges Committee being abused.

I remember the premier of the day was on that committee back in that time. Certainly, premier Giddings was on that committee for some period, possibly premier Bartlett, but I cannot recall specifically. It does not actually matter except to make the point that the committee is there as a longstanding historical part of the architecture of this House for the rare occasions where somebody does need to be brought to account by their peers. 

Be very careful what you weaponise; you may find it used against you in the future. You are going to so cheapen this process as to demean it and make it effectively useless in the future because you are politicising it. It makes my blood boil, and I think it is disappointing that the Greens, who are still a protest party, are wanting to use this 90-minute cheap political headline. No doubt there will be some kind of reporting, some kind of headline, and it upsets me. 

I have seen it happen to other good people who ought never have been sent to the Privileges Committee. It upset me then; it upsets me now. I see it only as people working in a workplace that is not really being fair dinkum, not being dinky-di with each other, because after the 90-minute episode has come and gone, you will have to live with this on your conscience, Mr Bayley. I believe better of you than to have brought this rubbish forward to our House, and I hope we can aim higher in future. No doubt, you are doing the will of your party room. This is an embarrassing attempt to stop the development of the stadium. That is what it is. That is its genesis. I have thoroughly described its character.

I want to ask a simple rhetorical question. The prosecution, being Mr Bayley, has brought the charge against minister Abetz. Minister Abetz has given a thorough defence of himself in, I think, some considerable detail. I ask this question: why should he? Why ought he have done such a good job? What if he was not able to do quite as competent a job as he has done? Would you persist with your silly motion? Would members of the Crossbench or the Opposition be tempted to vote for it because minister Abetz, or if it was a different minister or a different non minister, had not done such a good job?

The Greens members who brought this forward ought to have done a proper job - a competent job but there is actually built within the motion that we are debating a dishonesty. I will be generous and use the word 'dishonesty'. You have actually included the word 'impartial' in there, which does not appear in minister Abetz's utterances, nor those of Anne Beach. I notice you have left her out of it - one of the rare occasions you have not targeted a public servant. You have gone after a bigger rhinoceros, have you not, in your little spar?

Mr Abetz - I will take that as a compliment.

Members interjecting.
Mr FERGUSON - I cannot help but notice, though, that the CEO of the corporation, Anne Beach, had made very similar comments to minister Abetz.

Mr Bayley - She is not a member of this place, Mr Ferguson.

Mr FERGUSON - I do not think you would have missed the opportunity but again, the quote that I have before me does not refer to the words that you have used in the motion in respect of minister Abetz - the word 'impartial'. It is not there, and yet you put it in your poxy, filthy motion. It is not dinky-di. It is not real. You have actually come forward with a charge -

Mr Bayley - You guys are slandering the planning commission.

Mr FERGUSON - I have not even mentioned the planning commission.

Mr Bayley - No, you as a government.

Mr Deputy SPEAKER - Mr Bayley.

Mr FERGUSON - You have been exposed -

Mr Bayley - I have not seen anything this bad for a long time.

Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr Bayley.

Mr FERGUSON - you have been exposed [Bookmark: Phr2_O=2.7_D=9.3_C=0.85] , and it is only because of the reasonableness of other members of this House who do not belong to your party room that that exposure is actually occurring [Bookmark: Phr3_O=14.7_D=16.4_C=0.90] . I hope it is the case that the House dispenses with this motion in short order. 

I think it is despicable, because I foresee the same thing could happen to another member of this House. It could happen to you, Mr Bayley. It could happen to me. It could happen to anyone [Bookmark: Phr4_O=32.1_D=9.8_C=0.79] . Surely, we should be raising the standard. We have had lectures over and over about the culture of this House and the culture of this building [Bookmark: Phr5_O=42.7_D=10.1_C=0.88] . We are all contributors to that culture, and we are all individually responsible for what we say, but corporately we are responsible as an institution as well.

 [Bookmark: Phr6_O=53.5_D=4.8_C=0.69] Long live the Privileges and Conduct Committee to do its job [Bookmark: Phr7_O=59.4_D=11.2_C=0.82]  on those hopefully rare occasions where a serious breach of the Code of Conduct has occurred. Again, I will make the point that it is not a code of conduct that applies to ministers. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=71.5_D=4.9_C=0.84]  It is a code of conduct that applies to every member of this House - all 35 of us. [Bookmark: Phr9_O=79.5_D=6.5_C=0.78]  Why should minister Abetz have done such a good job of defending himself? He should not have been put in the position in the first place. [Bookmark: Phr10_O=87.0_D=11.2_C=0.82]  I see it as an abuse of this House. I see it as a potential abuse of the Privileges Committee. 

By the way, even the words of the motion [Bookmark: Phr11_O=101.2_D=18.1_C=0.77]  are suspect, because if it had passed, you would have your glorious headline that minister Abetz had been referred to Privileges Committee, this most powerful committee of the House and so on. Even your own words are so wishy-washy, proposing that the committee decide whether or not [Bookmark: Phr12_O=120.4_D=9.5_C=0.84]  there had been a breach of the Code of Conduct, noting that the key allegation here is that there has been a wilful and deliberate misleading of the House.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=131.7_D=16.2_C=0.74] I could not help but notice - because minister Abetz was good enough to share with me the letter that he received in the darkness of Monday evening -

Mr Abetz - Yes, 10.04 p.m.

Mr FERGUSON - that the minister was given the generous offer of the Greens to clean it up prior to question time on Tuesday morning [Bookmark: Phr14_O=149.5_D=1.5_C=0.49] . It is  [Bookmark: Phr15_O=151.7_D=5.7_C=0.82] self-defeating, because the political charge in this letter accuses the minister of something that could not have been [Bookmark: Phr16_O=157.5_D=14.0_C=0.81]  simply dealt away with by cleaning up the record on Tuesday morning, because the letter accuses the minister not of an accidental, inadvertent misleading - that is, getting it wrong, as we all do from time to time. [Bookmark: Phr17_O=175.1_D=8.8_C=0.68]  

The letter was prejudiced. I am not a lawyer either, but I know what without prejudice means, and I know what a prejudiced letter is, and this one had prejudice [Bookmark: Phr18_O=185.2_D=14.2_C=0.74]  because a paragraph in this letter says to minister Abetz:

… it is clear you have knowingly misled the parliament and the public by deliberately misrepresenting the MinterEllison letter as legal advice.

 [Bookmark: Phr19_O=201.5_D=1.2_C=0.71] It was biased from the outset. [Bookmark: Phr20_O=204.3_D=1.7_C=0.78]  It was prejudiced from the outset. [Bookmark: Phr21_O=206.8_D=1.8_C=0.72]  You were not really interested [Bookmark: Phr22_O=209.4_D=29.7_C=0.86]  in giving the minister an opportunity to correct the record because he inadvertently relied on advice that was not accurate, or relied on a memory that was faulty, or used the wrong word - which we all do from time to time. We are all human. There needs to be enough grace in this House to recognise that people make mistakes and ought to be afforded the opportunity to correct the record, update [Bookmark: Phr23_O=240.1_D=5.7_C=0.83]  the record and perhaps even apologise for not quite getting it right. I have done it many times.

 [Bookmark: Phr24_O=247.1_D=26.6_C=0.82] This letter indicates that the Greens, who always put themselves out there as just a little bit better than the rest of us - just a little bit stronger on integrity than the rest of us - but they were biased from the outset. They were not interested in the minister being able to tidy it up on Tuesday morning before questions, and they are certainly not interested today in passing it to the Privileges and Conduct Committee [Bookmark: Phr25_O=275.0_D=2.0_C=0.95]  to allow it to determine [Bookmark: Phr26_O=278.2_D=3.7_C=0.86] , to quote Mr Bayley's motion, 'whether or not this is a breach'.

 [Bookmark: Phr27_O=284.7_D=11.7_C=0.81] The days are now over where I will ever accept that the Greens are any better at integrity than the Liberal Party, the Labor Party, or the crossbench. Not at all [Bookmark: Phr28_O=297.5_D=5.3_C=0.66] . You have cheapened it today. I will go a step further, you have weaponised it today, to the point our party - and minister Abetz has spoken for himself. I will speak for myself and for the party I belong to. We have discussed this. We reject in the strongest possible terms any claim that minister Abetz has been misleading regarding the legal advice prepared for or on behalf of MPDC.

MinterEllison lawyers have been retained by the corporation since the outset of the stadium project. Anyone familiar with large and complex infrastructure projects would understand the importance of having access to high-quality legal advice. The exact words used by the CEO, Ms Beach, highly competent, respected public servant - and good on her.
'
Proponents of large infrastructure projects routinely engage lawyers. Given our planning system is underpinned by laws, having legal advice as a proponent generally comes in handy. It is a wise thing to do, particularly when you are going through a statutory planning process under the SPP act. 
Minister Abetz emphatically pointed out that such lawyers, acting on behalf of the proponent, have never claimed the word 'impartial.' That is not how the system works and minister Abetz made that point. He is a lawyer. I think he knows more about this than any member of the Greens. The lawyer is acting on behalf of their client. They are representing their client. I heard a casual interjection regarding tracked changes. Who cares that the client has discussed the correspondence with their lawyer? I find that unremarkable. I find that as unremarkable as a phone call. They collaborated on a representation to the TPC? I find that so unremarkable, I am surprised that you made the interjection, Mr Bayley. It is boring.

Mr Bayley - You are using it as a basis to tear down the whole process. You are tearing down the whole process based on that. 

Mr FERGUSON - It is boring. You are boring. Your interjection was irrelevant. I would expect a lawyer to discuss their instructions from their client: 'Does this meet your needs? Are we understanding each other correctly?'

By the way, Ms Beach refers to the letter as, amongst other things, being a representation as containing legal advice. I looked at the letter. I could see references to the state planning and policies act on numerous occasions, in the document. It plainly is based on the law. A company like MinterEllison, one of the world's leading law firms, is not going to be making representation by manufacturing arguments that do not have a basis in law. It contains legal opinion, it contains legal advice. It is a representation.

There is one group of people who have been caught out, who have been misrepresenting, and that is the Tasmanian Greens. I wonder to myself if they have done this all on their own. I suspect not. I wonder if there are any law firms that have been assisting Mr Bayley. While one law firm was mentioned earlier today, I feel no need to speculate on which firm Mr Bayley may or may not have been consulting, but I will defend his right to do it. If he wants to seek legal counsel for his letter that he wrote minister Abetz late on Monday night; or even legal help, drafting this poxy motion, I would not deny him the privilege of doing so. Any Australian citizen, any organisation, should be able to do that, and they do, just as MPDC have done.

Minister Abetz is plainly innocent of the charge. It is appalling that we are even having this complete waste-of-time debate today. I hope that I have done an okay job of trying to defend some of the forms of this House which ought to be reserved for those rare occasions when someone has flagrantly stepped out of line, away from public expectation of acting honestly and with integrity. I absolutely look forward to voting against this motion.

[4.52 p.m.]
Dr WOODRUFF (Franklin - Leader of the Greens) - Deputy Speaker, it is hard to know where to start. There is so much to choose from. The hypocrisy in this chamber is overwhelming. I will start in the first place with Mr Ferguson, who just spoke on his feet then. To lecture us about such an important matter, referring a minister to Privileges for having made misleading statements, for the investigation by his own peers, members of parliament, about him breaching the Code of Conduct, is incredible. When Mr Ferguson himself was prepared to drag and wanted to refer the former member for Lyons, Rebecca White, to Privileges on the most pathetic, low-level political issue that could ever be concocted, whether or not - by my memory, I do not have the words - she had actually received Brian Mitchell's support for her standing as a candidate for Lyons.
Honestly, what garbage. I cannot believe you could stand up here, Mr Ferguson, and concoct that on such a serious issue. Let us remind the House why we are here today: we are here today because there is a backflip on this government. They have broken their promise. They are going to spend up to $2 billion of taxpayers money over the next decade. That is a fact that the TPC has put on paper, the likely cost, and it is backed up by many independent experts.

The reason we are here today is because minister Abetz has been dishonest with Tasmanians and pretending that there is this thing called 'legal advice', which tells them that the TPC has actually done something which is inaccurate, is a corrupted process. That is essentially the argument that the government, through Mr Abetz, has now been perpetuating for the last couple of weeks. That is false and the reason it is false is because there was not legal advice that the government received that went - that MinterEllison letter was not legal advice.

Mr Ferguson - Well, what is it?

Dr WOODRUFF - That MinterEllison letter was a document prepared between some lawyers who are from an international firm called MinterEllison and it was prepared with -

Mr Abetz - It was medical advice.

Mr Ferguson - It was a document. From a lawyer.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Members will cease talking over the top of one another.

Mr Ellis - And what does that firm do? What does it do?

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Minister Ellis.

Dr WOODRUFF - I did get very much pulled into place on this.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - I have just pulled them into place as well, Dr Woodruff.

Dr WOODRUFF - Thank you very much, because I would really like people to understand what is happening here. The government, the MPDC and members of the senior public service, the head of the public service, the secretary of the public service, the deputy secretary of the public service, they sat around and they had a backwards and forwards - tracked changes - with a submission that was made to the Tasmanian Planning Commission on behalf of the MPDC, which is an arm of government. That is the document that has been waved around for Tasmanians as the reason that we have to have special legislation come to this place, which is, in Tasmania's history, the most outrageous, the most corrupted process ever. It will utterly cut Tasmanians out of having a proper say in the consultation. It is all designed to smear the Tasmanian Planning Commission and make it absolutely impossible that people could have any confidence in the report that they are in the process of delivering. A report, mind you, that this government is doing everything possible it can, to make sure Tasmanians do not have their say through public hearings and through that process. 

What we heard from DPAC staff in our briefing yesterday was that there is no legal advice. There has never been any legal advice. The document that was presented by minister Abetz where he was dishonest and misleading to Tasmanians on ABC Radio to Leon Compton, on Stateline, on numerous occasions in this House, was not legal advice. It was a representation. 

This is the point, Dr Broad: the difference is that it is not impartial. It is not an objective legal opinion. It is something that is been cooked up between the legal body, a bunch of lawyers and their clients; the head of the public service; the deputy head of the public service; the Macquarie Point Development Corporation who are acting for the government. That is the difference. There is nothing impartial about this, absolutely nothing. What I want to understand is why is Labor running a protection racket for the Liberals on this matter? Why? 

Dr Broad - It is good that you do not listen. You never listen. You never listen to an argument.

Dr WOODRUFF - I will tell you what you were not being honest about: it is the standard that you think is sufficient to refer a member of this House to Privileges. 

Dr Broad - We did; Barnett and Brooks.

Dr WOODRUFF - You are acting as though we are judge and jury of Mr Abetz.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Dr Woodruff, please direct your remarks through the Chair so that you are not inciting interjections.

Dr WOODRUFF - Dr Broad is trying to make a case that we are acting as judge and jury for the minister, Mr Abetz. We made a strong argument for why this House should refer Mr Abetz to Privileges to sit in front of his peers, of whom Dr Broad, I understand, would be one -

Dr Broad - No, I am not on it.

Dr WOODRUFF - Okay, well, there are several members of Labor who will be sitting on the privileges committee. The privileges committee, consisting of peers of Mr Abetz, will make a decision about whether the ministerial code of conduct has been breached. We argue very strongly that it has. We argue it has to stand for something. If you are looking at the ministerial code of conduct and the members' code of conduct - I will start with the ministerial code of conduct. It says:

Ministers must not deliberately make statements that mislead Parliament or the public and in line with Parliamentary practice are obliged to correct the record in a manner that is appropriate to the circumstances, as soon as possible after any incorrect statement is made.

It is recognised that a mistake or referring to incorrect information does not, in and of itself, constitute the offence of misleading Parliament as long as it is corrected as soon as possible once the error is identified.

The deputy leader of the Greens wrote to Mr Abetz and gave him plenty of time. He did not have to do it by Question Time yesterday. He could have done it this morning or in the adjournment last night. As a minister, there were many opportunities before him in this place to retract his words, which are untrue. 
It is not true that there is legal advice. We cannot say it more plainly. We asked the question in the briefing and the Department of Premier and Cabinet (DPAC) staff told us it was not legal advice. What was given to the planning commission was legal representation. I asked the staff member whether there was legal advice and he told us, 'Yes, there is', and I said, 'Well, we would like to see a copy, please.' What has been provided to the Tasmanian Planning Commission as a representation of this government through the Macquarie Point Development Corporation, what has been held up to Tasmanians as the reason to throw out the planning process in train and make it the responsibility of public servants to go through this charade of developing a planning permit and planning conditions that is then going to come to us as special legislation, has all hung on this argument that Mr Abetz has been misleading Tasmanians about. There never was legal advice.

A member - Of course, there was.

Dr WOODRUFF - Well, we want to see it, because it is not the letter that has been made public. That is legal representation: that is a submission to the planning commission. That has backwards and forwards track-changes in it. It had the input of state servants, it had the input of the government, on behalf of the government, and that is exactly the point. Mr Abetz does not like to hear the fact that it was not impartial legal advice, but that is exactly the point we are making. It cannot be impartial if it is being prepared, in part, with the client. That is not impartial. Representation is partial by its very nature. There is a difference in law. Impartial legal advice is a lawyer giving advice to the client without any influence. Without any influence - that is the difference. That is the point we are trying to make. 

The Macquarie Point Development Corporation said, as Mr Abetz tried to say, that it was not legal opinion. Why should we believe them? They are acting for the government in this matter. It is irrelevant what the Macquarie Point Development Corporation says. Here we have the Macquarie Point Development Corporation saying it has received legal advice, but its own board has had a hand in writing it.

We need Tasmanians to understand what is going on here. The government is smearing the Tasmanian Planning Commission and the reputations of the people working right now on the process that parliament ordered them to start. They have been doing that work in good faith and this government is smearing their reputations - 

A member - You are smearing public servants and others.

Mr Abetz - And me.

Dr WOODRUFF - smearing those people who are doing their work - the former assistant solicitor-general of Tasmania, the former secretary of Treasury, people who know what they are doing. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=29.3_D=26.8_C=0.88]  They know how to follow the order of parliament and that is what they are doing. 

We need this to be called out for what it is. It has been cooked up as a pretence [Bookmark: Phr4_O=59.5_D=14.3_C=0.85]  for why we need special legislation by government, on behalf of the minister, and whoever else was involved in the conversation. We are not privy to the emails [Bookmark: Phr3_O=57.7_D=1.4_C=0.47] .

It is disappointing that Labor is running a protection racket for this when they were more than happy in September the year before last to try to refer [Bookmark: Phr5_O=75.5_D=21.4_C=0.71]  Guy Barnett to Privileges over a matter their own media release described as fudging Marinus costs. Fudging Marinus costs is a serious matter that should be investigated, and this is a serious matter that should be investigated. We are not standing here as judge and jury on this. All we are saying is that Mr Abetz should be referred to Privileges. What is the standard in this place if the Labor Party and people like Mr Ferguson, who is happy to refer people to the privileges committee for utterly political issues, things to do with the Labor Party's internal [Bookmark: Phr7_O=127.3_D=29.4_C=0.84]  negotiations and discussions, are not prepared to support an investigation by Mr Abetz's peers of what we believe are patently dishonest and misleading statements. 

We will continue to speak for Tasmanians on this. People know that what is happening is shonky. They understand that the government is trying to push through a corrupted process. [Bookmark: Phr8_O=157.1_D=30.0_C=0.86]  They know this special legislation is all about making sure Tasmanians and this parliament do not see the final planning commission report. The reason this is going on is to make sure members of the Legislative Council, in particular, but all of us and all Tasmanians do not see the final report. What do you have to be afraid of? This is the process the government established; this is the process [Bookmark: Phr9_O=187.2_D=28.7_C=0.81]  the parliament has ordered to go ahead. 

Mr Abetz - How is this relevant?

Dr WOODRUFF - It is relevant because that is why you are misleading Tasmanians with your statements. You are trying to present it as though there is something legal, some truth in the argument you presented that there is a problem with the planning commission's process. You are wrong. It is deceitful, it is misleading and there is no basis for that [Bookmark: Phr10_O=216.1_D=15.6_C=0.90] . We understand that this has to be properly investigated and we will keep fighting for the truth because Tasmanians are sickened at the idea of building a stadium that will hold us in debt [Bookmark: Phr11_O=232.8_D=13.9_C=0.78] . Former MLCs Ivan Dean and Greg Hall have calculated that it will cost $11 million for a game to be played [Bookmark: Phr12_O=246.7_D=28.0_C=0.82]  at the stadium if it is built in Hobart. That means $76,000 a year of debt for every man, woman and child in Tasmania. It is critical that we continue to speak the truth about what is going on here.

The government has an addiction to building a stadium and  [Bookmark: Phr13_O=275.7_D=0.6_C=0.81] is pretending [Bookmark: Phr14_O=276.6_D=28.2_C=0.81]  there is something wrong with the process it set up because it is afraid of the outcome. They know that the POSS process, when it is delivered, will be done with some thoroughness and that is exactly what they are trying to avoid. Those on the government benches do not want to hear and do not want MLCs to hear and feel the pressure from their communities when the full and unadulterated truth of what the impact of the stadium and the cost to this state will be is known. 

We know that the federal Liberal Party was thinking of trying to pull the $240 million commitment from the federal government to the stadium. They knew what a stinker this stadium is in northern Tasmania. Federal candidates who were standing in the recent election were desperately trying to hold onto their seats. They were trying to get that removed from the federal Liberal Party's policy platform. They were not successful. History will show, amongst many other reasons, that the stadium had an impact on the vote that we saw in Tasmania, the swing to the Labor Party and the big increase for the Greens in the Senate. History will show this. It is the Liberals who suffered. There were many reasons for that, but there is no doubt that the stadium was part of it.

We listen to people in Tasmania. We are taking on board their concerns. We know the people in Launceston want to have York Park as the home of football. We have heard Mr Garland's impassioned speeches about people in Braddon, people in his electorate. We understand that the people of Yolla are outraged at the idea that this government is going to spend up to $2 billion over the next decade and will put a stadium in a place which they cannot reach, even if they wanted to. How could people in Yolla ever afford or be able to come down and find accommodation to be at a game?

Mr ABETZ - Point of order. 

The SPEAKER - I will hear the point of order.

Mr ABETZ - I would like to know how the capacity of people from Yolla getting to the stadium is in any way, shape, or form relevant to a motion referring me to the Privileges committee.

The SPEAKER - You may call for a point of order on relevance. I will remind the member that standing order 142 requires the content to be relevant to the motion before the House. The motion before the House is the referral to the committee, so I will bring the member to that.

Dr WOODRUFF - Thank you, honourable Speaker. I am delighted to return to the issue of why minister Eric Abetz needs to go to the Privileges committee. It is because he has been misleading Tasmanians. The reason he is misleading is because he is trying to hide the truth. He and his government are desperately doing everything they can to make sure that the POSS process is not completed, and to make sure that we do not have the final TPC report.

That is why we are going through this fast-tracked, corrupted process, the special legislation. Government staff agencies are being pulled into day-long workshops to sit around in a room to try to cook up permit conditions and try to hastily scratch together some semblance of planning order from people who are not proper planners. We are expected to have dished up to us legislation that is going to rush through this stadium in unholy order. The reason behind it is that they are afraid of the truth. They know the majority of Tasmanians do not stand with them. They know that people are outraged.

Time expired.

The SPEAKER (Ms O'Byrne) - The question is that the motion be agreed to.

MOTION

Integrity Commission Review

[5.19 p.m.]
Mr JENNER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, a vote will be required. I move -

That the House -

Notes: -

comments made by the Chief Commissioner of the Integrity Commission, Mr Greg Melick in October 2024 stating “We are the most under-funded integrity body in the country. We have also been waiting for legislative amendments to improve our efficacy for nearly 10 years”; 

that of the 55 recommendations outlined in the 2016 Independent Review of the Integrity Commission Act 2009 by the Hon William Cox AC, RFD, ED, QC, only six have been implemented; and 

that the Integrity Commission outlined a number of recommendations in its 2022 discussion paper which it says should be implemented as a high priority. 

Calls on the Government to: -

implement all the recommendations outlined in Appendix A of the Integrity Commission’s 2022 discussion paper as a matter of priority, to ensure their implementation by the end of the 2025 calendar year; and 

(b)	report back to the House by the end of September 2025 on the progress of these matters, noting that continued inaction after 10 years of doing nothing will be totally unacceptable to the Parliament and the Tasmanian community. (6 May 2025)

Major reforms to our Integrity Commission should have been on the government's agenda a long time ago. The JLN has recognised the need for the reform from the moment we became involved in state parliament. As part of our original confidence and supply agreement, the government agreed to undertake a review of the Integrity Commission. However, nearly a year later, it claimed that that review could not proceed due to legal issues.

The Tasmanian Integrity Commission was established nearly 14 years ago following a series of recommendations made by the Parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Ethical Conduct. The Joint Select Committee on Ethical Conduct was established in 2008 in response to the growing concerns about ethical standards in public offices. At the time, Tasmania was one of the very few states without an independent integrity body and there has been increasing pressure from both the public and within parliament to address this gap.

The committee was tasked with examining how to strengthen the accountability and promote ethical conduct across the public sector. Its final report laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Integrity Commission, aimed at restoring public trust and providing proper oversight for those in positions of power. Since its inception, the Integrity Commission has faced major criticisms regarding its effectiveness - through no fault of their own, I might add. It is due to the lack of funding and much needed legislation amendments.

The Chief Integrity Commissioner, Greg Melick, said in his media release in October 2024:

We are the most underfunded integrity body in the country. We have also been waiting for legislative amendments to improve our efficiency for nearly 10 years.

The original 2009 legislation that set up the Integrity Commission included a requirement for a mandatory review of five years, which ultimately led to the establishment of the Cox review, published in 2016. As many of you will no doubt be aware, the Cox review set out 55 recommendations to strengthen the Integrity Commission. Nearly a decade later, the government has managed to implement just six of those 55 recommendations. In my opinion, this is nothing short of appalling.

By deliberately restricting the power and funding of the Integrity Commission and dragging its heels on implementation of key recommendations, once again, in my opinion, has found a way of avoiding scrutiny and evade accountability. It is public knowledge and we also know that two members of parliament are being currently investigated. The investigation that has remarkably been ongoing now for three years without resolution, which is unfair to them and the commission.

In November last year, the chief commissioner stated, 'It is almost impossible to investigate allegations against Tasmanian MPs unless they consent to it.' He also stated that the commission is restrained in its investigations by lack of government funding and legislative barriers.

The full quote from Mr Melick says this:

We are still having significant problems in reaching a protocol when investigating members of parliament or members of parliamentary staff.

It makes it almost impossible to investigate a member of parliament or a member of parliamentary staff unless they are fully compliant and consent rather than being compelled.

This, on its own, is enough to send shivers up your spine - that they are not being accountable. It is like telling a police officer that they can only bring a suspect in if the suspect fully complies and gives him their consent - an approach that would paralyse any attempt to enforce anything or make anyone accountable. It would make it impossible.

The fact remains that for nearly a decade this government has avoided accountability, whether through deliberate action or blatant neglect, by underfunding the Integrity Commission and failing to provide it with the necessary powers to fulfil its role. When we look at the funding, in the years that followed the Cox review, the commission has been crying out for more funding at each successive budget. Regarding last year's funding of the commission, the Chief Commissioner said:

The marginal increasements to our funds from 2024 to 2025 in the budget does not meet our needs. If we are to fulfil our statutory obligations to meet the community's expectations, our resources needs cannot be neglected. We call upon the parliament to properly resource and empower us to be the Integrity Commission that Tasmanians deserve.

Last year, the Tasmanian Integrity Commission was allocated $3.7 million in funding. While this amount may initially seem reasonable, it pales into comparison to budgets of other similar agencies across the country.

Ms Ogilvie - But we are tiny.

Mr JENNER - I will come to that, if you let me.

The former commissioner of the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (IBAC), Robert Redlich, said about the Tasmanian Integrity Commission:

The legislation that governs the Tasmanian Integrity Commission is wanting in a vast number of ways, but most significantly in funding - $3 million is disgraceful.

The Victorian Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (IBAC) receives $63.9 million. The New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) has allocated nearly $43 million. Additionally, the ICAC received a substantial funding boost of $228 million over a 10-year period to support its integrity and anti-corruption efforts.

I acknowledge that there is considerable difference in population size between the two states. Victoria's population is approximately 11 times larger than Tasmania's. However, if Tasmania's Integrity Commission was funded on a per capita basis equivalent to Victoria, it would receive nearly $6 million in funding, almost $2 million more annually than it currently gets.

In response to the Weiss review conducted last year, the Chief Commissioner said:

Ms Weiss has recommended we be given a range of powers, some of which we already possess. Importantly, we barely have the resources to exercise our existing powers as envisaged and expected by the Tasmanian Parliament and the public.

We have the equivalent of less than 5 full-time employees in our Complaints and Oversight teams combined. As skilled and motivated as our staff are, it is not possible within our current resourcing to thoroughly oversight the some 40,000 or so public sector workers in Tasmania, including the over 1,400 police officers.

Despite its best efforts, the Integrity Commission is operating with one hand tied behind its back while trying to hop on one leg, due to chronic underfunding and the government's failure to deliver the legislation and reforms it recommended in the Cox report almost a decade ago.

Crucially, even the Chief Commissioner has conceded that, under the current conditions, the commission cannot properly carry out its duties. This is completely unacceptable. The commissioner must be given the tools and support it needs to do its job. Change is long overdue.

On the implementation of the recommendations, I believe I have made clear already why changes need to be made. We have an Integrity Commission that has been constrained both by legislation and funding to the point where it is rendered virtually ineffective. This government agreed to implement the majority of the Cox recommendations and yet here we are, 10 years later, still waiting. It is disgraceful and not what the Tasmanian people expect or deserve.

In 2022, the Integrity Commission, with the Department of Justice, released a discussion paper setting out its views on the Cox report's recommendations. It identified the most urgent reform still needed to strengthen the commissioner's powers, and it said this:

The Commission has identified a number of Cox Review Recommendations as being high priority, with some being considered to be of greater urgency due to operational impact. In addition, there are also a number of recommendations which were accepted by the government and appear to involve relatively straightforward amendments.

It is proposed to address these recommendations, as discussed below, in the next tranche of legislative reform. By the government's own admission on several occasions, they are already in possession of the second tranche of implementations of the Cox review recommendations. Given that, I fail to see why the implementation of these recommendations, which are outlined in Appendix A of the discussion paper, would be such a challenge for the government.

At the same time, the government has been able to rapidly draft the special legislation and is working overtime, in their own words, to get shovels in the ground for the stadium by Christmas. If they are capable of moving at this pace for a billion-dollar stadium project, then surely they can also implement the integrity reforms that have been clearly set out with a detailed road map already provided for them. It is what Tasmanians expect and deserve.

If we are going to have any faith in us as politicians and other public servants to be held accountable, this must be done. 

The SPEAKER - Before I give the call to the member, as previously advised, I intend to leave the Chair.

The House suspended until the ringing of the bells.

The SPEAKER - I thank members for their attendance. The organisers were aware that we would have to leave, so the timing may have looked awkward, but they were aware.

[5.54 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Attorney-General) -  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=97.5_D=4.5_C=0.92] Honourable Speaker, before reflecting on [Bookmark: Phr5_O=103.9_D=4.1_C=0.56]  the member for Lyons, Andrew Jenner's motion, I acknowledge the [Bookmark: Phr6_O=108.6_D=1.4_C=0.46]  vigil that [Bookmark: Phr7_O=111.2_D=26.0_C=0.85]  I believe many in this Chamber attended, and indeed many others, for family violence. I appreciate the organisers doing what they have done and acknowledge the pain and sadness, grief and suffering of so many. I indicate the commitment to do more on all of our behalves going forward. I want to acknowledge that at the beginning of this [Bookmark: Phr8_O=138.1_D=5.4_C=0.76]  debate.

I wanted to thank Mr Jenner for bringing forward [Bookmark: Phr9_O=144.0_D=2.9_C=0.77]  this motion, noting [Bookmark: Phr10_O=148.3_D=4.0_C=0.90]  the situation regarding the Integrity Commission [Bookmark: Phr11_O=153.1_D=15.6_C=0.78]  and quoting the Chief Commissioner, Greg Melick, who I want to acknowledge for his leadership and support of the commission and the work that he has undertaken. I have known the Chief Commissioner for some time and [Bookmark: Phr12_O=170.4_D=15.0_C=0.79]  meet regularly with the Chief Commissioner. I would also like to acknowledge the new CEO, Ellen McKenzie. I had the privilege of supporting her appointment on behalf of the government [Bookmark: Phr13_O=185.9_D=24.7_C=0.84]  last year and she started earlier this year. I have met again with the CEO and communicated with her on a number of occasions. Having her experience and background from New South Wales is very much to Tasmania's credit and I look forward to ongoing communication and working together.

 [Bookmark: Phr14_O=211.8_D=4.7_C=0.71] I acknowledge the motion and indicate the government' [Bookmark: Phr15_O=218.1_D=9.9_C=0.82] s willingness, having worked through the substance of the motion, to indicate that we will be supporting the motion of Mr Jenner [Bookmark: Phr16_O=229.8_D=10.2_C=0.88] . We do strongly support the Integrity Commission and we do have confidence in its ability to perform its functions [Bookmark: Phr17_O=241.8_D=1.5_C=0.77]  and to say that the commission [Bookmark: Phr18_O=245.4_D=3.4_C=0.73]  operates independently. It is free from ministerial direction [Bookmark: Phr19_O=249.4_D=7.2_C=0.88]  or control, and it is not part of any other government department or agency.

 [Bookmark: Phr20_O=258.0_D=24.4_C=0.86] The three primary objectives of the commission itself are to improve the standard of conduct, propriety and ethics in public authorities in Tasmania. It is to enhance public confidence that misconduct in public officers will be appropriately investigated and dealt with, and enhance the quality of and commitment to ethical conduct [Bookmark: Phr21_O=283.1_D=4.7_C=0.86]  by adopting a strong educative, preventative, and advisory role [Bookmark: Phr22_O=288.8_D=2.2_C=0.86] . Prior to [Bookmark: Phr23_O=292.9_D=12.0_C=0.77]  being in Cabinet, I believe it was mid-2016, I did spend some time on the joint parliamentary committee with respect to the Integrity Commission and I want to acknowledge the work of that committee. It is a joint parliamentary committee, so both Houses of parliament. They also do important work and provide advice and feedback to the parliament and, of course, to me from time to time as an attorney-general, and I just wanted to acknowledge their work as well.

I want to acknowledge the honourable William Cox AC, RFD, ED KC. In 2016 he undertook an independent statutory review of the Integrity Commission Act 2009. I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank the honourable Mr Cox for his work. Of course as the former chief justice, former governor, he was incredibly credentialed for that work and for so many other things. I have the highest regard for the honourable Mr Cox and I thank him for his work, that important review. I want to acknowledge all those stakeholders who subsequently provided feedback to inform the implementation of the recommendations made as part of this review.

As Mr Jenner has indicated, Mr Cox's report contained 55 recommendations. It was tabled in both Houses of parliament on 24 August 2016 and the government tabled its formal response on 17 November 2016. In this response, our government accepted the majority of the recommendations in full or in principle, noting that some required further consideration and consultation.

In 2017, the government introduced a first tranche of amendments to address technical and other relatively straightforward matters dealt with in the first six recommendations, and that has been acknowledged by Mr Jenner, for which I am grateful. The Integrity Commission Amendment Act 2017 was passed by parliament and came into effect on 13 June 2017.

The remaining recommendations are significantly more detailed, and it is a very complex area. I should emphasise this is a complex area of law with many additional issues and proposals arising out of the later reviews and consultation, with one of the recommendations alone proposing 45 technical amendments to the act.

In relation to the discussion paper referenced by the member, that paper was prepared and released by our government on 8 July 2022 to inform the implementation of the recommendations, and I have that paper here. It has been referred to as Appendix A, the Cox Review Report, recommendations to proceed in the next stage of legislative reform. It is quite a substantial document referred to by the honourable member. It refers to the various recommendations and, of course, the relevant responses and it was set out as a discussion paper. 

The government has put the shoulder to the wheel in that regard and that was released on 8 July 2022. There has already been significant work undertaken in considering the remaining recommendations and other suggested reforms, including consultation, through the release of that paper. The body of the discussion paper raised the following areas for particular comments:

17 areas of the Cox Review report were initial government and commission responses and required financial analysis, final analysis and consultation before progressing;
14 new matters raised by the commission;
the application of the active members of parliament during election campaigns was another one; and
the review of offences related to disclosure of official secrets and unauthorised access to a computer, which the commission had previously raised in their 2018 report.

Twenty-two submissions were received in response to the discussion paper. It is the government's intention to introduce further legislation to parliament to address the remaining recommendations following appropriate drafting and stakeholder engagement. I want to emphasise that. That is the response, and I acknowledge the honourable member for Lyons, if that could be noted. That is the government's intention. This work is being guided by feedback from the discussion paper, the commission's input, and findings from more recent reviews. 

The honourable member has kindly referred to the JLN Agreement with the Premier. I believe it was April last year and, of course, those discussions and that engagement continued for some time. It was based on legal advice that that was then not to proceed.

The government has taken on board the Cox review and other feedback provided in response to the discussion paper. I note the Weiss review, as well. The government has accepted the Weiss review report and recommendations. Added to all that is the Commission of Inquiry into the Tasmanian Government's Response to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings. Both of those reports made recommendations in relation to the Integrity Commission. 

Members will be aware that these are clearly complex and inter-related issues, and I can advise their joint progress is under careful consideration by the Department of Justice. I have talked to and met with my secretary and the team at the Department of Justice, and this is all progressing, and I am pleased with that. It has been given careful consideration, with my instructions to progress that reform.

In terms of integrity and the evidence bill - a bill to address a further tranche of the Cox recommendations, as well as a recommendation of the commission of inquiry in relation to the Integrity Commission, was released for consultation late last year. Submissions on the bill closed on 17 November 2024, and the department had meetings with the Integrity Commission to discuss the bill this year. 

Work on the bill highlighted the inter-related issues in the Cox recommendations, and that it is preferable to progress a consolidated bill on the recommendations this year. The Department of Justice continues to progress a plan for staged implementation of these recommendations in discussion with the Integrity Commission.

In terms of funding, I note previous comments by the chief commissioner in 2022 that:

It is difficult to directly compare interstate integrity and anti-corruption bodies. They have different powers and responsibilities, which require different structures and resourcing models.

This is certainly the case, and our government continues to engage with the commission to understand their funding requirements. In addition to the annual funding of the commission in the 2024-25 Budget, which was brought down last September, the government provided additional funding of $800,000 over four years to support the commission to implement its oversight and compliance program, which is to actively monitor and oversee notifications and investigations conducted by public authorities. The government is committed to providing the Integrity Commission with the tools required to perform its functions, and this funding commitment affirms our support for the important work undertaken by the commission.

As the Premier has previously stated, the government is progressing implementation of the remaining recommendations made by the Cox review, as well as the recommendations of the Weiss review and the commission of inquiry in relation to the Integrity Commission as soon as possible. I believe the Premier put that on the record this morning. I am putting it on the record again during this debate in response to Mr Jenner's motion.

Accordingly, we support the motion before the House today. We look forward to introducing the relevant legislation later this year to advance this important work. We would hope for and plan to have consultation on that legislation in the usual way, and I look forward to bringing that back into the public arena in due course. Once again, I thank the member for his motion, for his commitment to the Integrity Commission and to the parliamentary processes and public processes more generally. Thank you, and I thank the House.

[6.07 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - I have a lot to say about this. I am going to try not to take up all the time, but members would know this is an issue that the Labor Party is very passionate about and that I personally have raised in this place many times. I commend Mr Jenner for bringing on this motion, and I know you have asked questions about it previously as well in parliament.

It is encouraging to hear the Attorney-General say that there is work progressing, but, while not wanting to be rude, we have heard that before. We have been hearing it for 10 years. In 2022 I asked a question in very similar terms. I asked a question of Premier Rockliff, who was relatively new to the premiership at that time. I said:

You said that you would lead a government with integrity. 

I mentioned the 2016 review of Tasmania's Integrity Commission by [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.5_D=29.8_C=0.84]  the honourable William Cox that made 55 recommendations to approve the ability of the commission to uphold the integrity standards expected by Tasmanians, and I said:

Six years later, the Attorney-General has implemented just six of these 55 recommendations. Will you direct the Attorney-General to implement the remaining recommendations as a priority, or are you too weak to get this done?

That is pretty mean, is it not? Maybe I have changed a bit since then. The answer is not dissimilar to the answer that we just heard from the honourable Attorney-General, Mr Barnett [Bookmark: Phr3_O=60.7_D=26.8_C=0.82]  - and that was back in 2022. Mr Rockliff said that integrity mattered to him, that reform of the commission requires considerable work. He said it is being progressed in the department - that the first phase of recommendations was implemented in 2017 and the second tranche is currently underway as indicated in the government's response to Mr Cox's review. He said the Department of Justice is continuing to work through the recommendations and the minister expects advice and options for reform shortly.

 [Bookmark: Phr4_O=88.4_D=1.6_C=0.77] That was in 2022. [Bookmark: Phr5_O=90.4_D=29.8_C=0.88]  That is a long time ago. Mr Cox's review was further ago still. It is nearly 10 years since he made those 55 recommendations to government, and it is not good enough that only six of them have been implemented. Nobody denies that the work is complex, but the work has not been a priority for this government. It is clear that it has not been a priority because here we are 10 years later. Lots of legislative reform has been achieved, including complex legislative reform across a range of different areas, yet this one is still sitting on the shelf gathering dust. A lot has changed since then. 

The Attorney-General is not wrong when he mentions the things that have happened since Mr Cox's review. There has been the commission of inquiry; the government's discussion paper; and several reports - media reports, academic reports and reports from civil society organisations who have looked at our Integrity Commission and who have made [Bookmark: Phr7_O=146.0_D=3.1_C=0.88]  recommendations to government for significant change [Bookmark: Phr8_O=149.5_D=29.7_C=0.86] . Yet nothing is happening. The wheels are spinning and we want to know when are we actually going to see an Integrity Commission with teeth in this state.

We do not have an Integrity Commission with teeth, and we are hearing those concerns around what they can and cannot do even from the people who are in charge. Mr Melick, the Chief Commissioner, has talked about the challenges of funding. He has talked about the challenges of resourcing that are facing his organisation and [Bookmark: Phr9_O=179.6_D=4.6_C=0.76]  the barriers for them to be able to do their work.

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=185.4_D=26.2_C=0.86] The Attorney-General quoted the Chief Commissioner saying that we cannot compare the Tasmanian Integrity Commission to other jurisdictions because other jurisdictions have different models and different powers. Exactly - that is what we are talking about. That is what all of those reviews and reports since have been talking about. Tasmania's Integrity Commission does have different powers and jurisdiction. It is too narrow. [Bookmark: Phr11_O=212.5_D=4.1_C=0.78]  The Tasmanian Integrity Commission has one of the narrowest jurisdictions in the country. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=217.2_D=12.9_C=0.86]  It has per capita the lowest funding of any integrity commission or like body in the country, and those things impede its work. 

That is seen through the fact that most of their work is very slow. That is not a criticism of the people working there; it is a criticism of the low resourcing that has been provided [Bookmark: Phr14_O=239.5_D=28.2_C=0.90] . There is also the fact that there have been no public hearings. I know that they carry with them a risk, and I know how some of those other models in other states and territories operate in a different way to Tasmania's and it may carry risk, but there is an inherent risk in the work that is done by integrity commission bodies around the country. Nevertheless, it is incredibly important work that they do to maintain integrity in our political systems and to maintain faith in public institutions [Bookmark: Phr15_O=268.1_D=14.2_C=0.87] , and that is what is being lost in Tasmania.

I have said it in this place before: we are extremely lucky. The 35 of us who serve in this Chamber are the ones who are here right now. We will not be here forever. Hundreds have come before us [Bookmark: Phr16_O=282.6_D=21.9_C=0.88] , but we have the job right now of maintaining the faith of the Tasmanian people in the integrity of the work we do as parliamentarians. We all do it differently. We come from different communities and different value sets; we have different motivations, different passions. That is fine. That is what makes up a democracy, but we are doing this job at a time when faith in politics is at an all-time low.

Faith in politicians, in our profession, is at an all-time low. We are rated below the trustworthiness of used car salesmen. I have met some very honest used car salesmen. Again, it is not a slight on that industry. People do not have faith in us anymore and it is our job to show them that they can and that they should. Part of that means properly and robustly funding and providing the jurisdiction that is needed to bodies like the Integrity Commission. It has been described as a toothless tiger and it has been described as powerless.

I have shared with the Chamber before some of the comments that others have made, but as people would know, there have been a number of criticisms made. I will share one of them. Sydney barrister Geoffery Watson SC, who has worked as counsel assisting the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). He believes that Tasmania's Integrity Commission is not doing enough to expose corruption in this state. He argues that the Commission should be more active in getting a message out to public officials that the organisation was 'breathing down your neck' by conducting more of its operations in the public domain. He talks about the Integrity Commission having the power to hold public hearings and convene tribunals, but not having done so, which he described as concerning.

That is not about creating an environment where every investigation they do is a public investigation; there is a time and a place for those. The fact is, we all know when matters have been referred to the commission that they have not been able to look at them because their jurisdiction is so narrow.

One example was one that I referred to the commission in 2021, about the time of the state election. It was confirmed by the election spokesperson, Mr Ferguson, who has just come into the Chamber, at the time that as much as $100,000 of taxpayers' money had been spent on Liberal Party brochures, which would have constituted electoral matter by most people's definition, if they had seen these materials. In a nutshell, the flyers were Liberal Party flyers. They were ordered and paid for and the Australia Post booking to deliver them were all done before the election got called. Then they were delivered during the election period. The reason that the Integrity Commission could not investigate my allegation that taxpayers' money had been used on Liberal Party election materials was very disappointing. The response to me was quite disappointing and what they said to me was:

That they could not investigate Liberal Party spending.

It was not Liberal Party spending, it was taxpayers' money spent by MPs. It was the members resource allowance that had been spent.

They said that they could not investigate it because it was during the issue of the writs, and we are not considered public officers and cannot be investigated by the commission during the issue of the writs.

However, my argument was that the offending behaviour had happened before the issuing of the writs: the design of the brochures, the printing of the brochures and booking Australia Post delivery of the brochures.

They said we could never have known if they would be delivered during the election period because we did not know when the election was going to be called.

They were ordered, printed and booked by the premier, Peter Gutwein's office. Peter Gutwein then went on to call the election. I would argue he did know when the election was going to be called and it was a tricky way of finding a way to use taxpayers' money on Liberal Party materials.

I referred that to the Integrity Commission. They could not look at it for those reasons, demonstrating very clearly, albeit that I have given you a very short rundown of how that complaint played out, that their jurisdiction is too narrow. That is what organisations like the Australia Institute and others have been arguing for a very long time. I do not always agree with everything that the Australia Institute says, but on the Integrity Commission, I absolutely do.

They talk about it being a toothless tiger. They talk about its jurisdiction needing to be broadened, particularly to politicians inside the issue of the writs. It does seem a massive gap that MPs cannot be investigated during an election period. Equally, there are very solid arguments for its jurisdiction to be broadened, to have an Integrity Commission with teeth, so that Tasmanians can actually have faith, not only in the work of the commission itself but in the work of our public institutions, the parliament and the public sector.

I commend Mr Jenner for bringing on this motion today. It is not too much to ask that this next tranche of work would be prioritised by this Attorney-General. We have been told as a Chamber that this work is being prioritised ever since it was delivered to the government. It feels like things have stalled. It feels like the wheels are spinning. It feels like this simply is not a priority for government. It needs to be. It needs to be a priority for the sake of good governance and for integrity in this state.

[6.18 p.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, for almost a decade we have been told that the reforms are coming, but this government has only actioned six of the 55 recommendations from the Cox review since 2016.

We welcome Mr Jenner's motion today. In fact, it was mid-last year in the other place that the Greens member for Hobart, Ms O'Connor, also had a similar motion in relation to the Integrity Commission. The member for Hobart's motion noted the vital role of the Integrity Commission, but that it is an Integrity Commission that needs teeth. It needs to be fully funded. I would like to read from Ms O'Connor's speech in the other place. She said:

The resistance to some of these quite straightforward improvements to the act and functioning of the Integrity Commission makes an old cynic like me pretty cynical, actually, because it feels like there is a real unwillingness on the part of government to do anything to give the Integrity Commission the powers that it needs.
 
Ms O'Connor is absolutely right. In 2022, the Department of Justice released a discussion paper proposing a number of Cox review reforms to progress in the next tranche of reforms; the paper that Mr Jenner notes in his motion. Three years later, there has still been no progress on those reforms. Also in 2022, the Australia Institute released the report 'Still Toothless' by the fiercely intelligent Ms Hay, and it talked about the erosion of public trust in the commission. As was outlined by the member for Clark, Ms Haddad, that is not a reflection of the people in the commission, but rather that it is underfunded and has an incredibly narrow scope that it is trying to operate in.

The Cox review recommendations were joined by recommendation 5 of the Weiss review in 2024. That recommendation begins with:

That consideration be given by Tasmania Police to making a recommendation to the Tasmanian Government for amendments to the Integrity Commission Act 2009 to ensure that all notifications made to the Integrity Commission in respect of members of Tasmania Police who are alleged to have groomed and/or sexually abused persons [serious misconduct] can be investigated independently by the Integrity Commission through - 

It goes on to list the powers that could be expanded. It also reiterates recommendation 35 of the Cox review, made back in 2016. On page 51 of the Weiss review into Paul Reynolds, under 'Integrity Commissions - A comparative analysis of Australian jurisdictions', it says:

Tasmania’s Integrity Commission was established by the Integrity Commission Act 2009 and as noted above, commenced operating in 2010. As the following comparative analysis will show, the Tasmanian Integrity Commission’s powers vis-à-vis police are significantly lesser to analogous integrity commissions and bodies with jurisdiction over law enforcement in other Australian States and Territories. 

Strengthening investigative powers to assist in the detection of police misconduct such as that perpetuated by Reynolds for over 30 years would be a step in the right direction to answering the question raised by several Review participants: "Who polices the police?''

It goes on:

In its current state, the Tasmanian Integrity Commission does not measure up to its interstate counterparts with respect to investigative powers over law enforcement officers for serious misconduct such as that perpetuated by Reynolds.

Also in the government's response to the commission of inquiry, there were further recommendations. A core recommendation from the Commission of Inquiry into the Government's Response to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings was that the statutory entities should be working together to establish a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to broaden their collaboration, their data-sharing, and for clear delineation and understanding of what the statutory roles and understandings of those groups were. To be captured under that memorandum of understanding was the Commissioner of Children, the Ombudsman, the Integrity Commissioner, of course, and the Registrar for the registration to work with vulnerable people scheme. 

Where is the update on that MOU - agreed upon or adopted?

In the government's response to recommendation 18.11 of the commission of inquiry, the government commented:

A Bill for this and other matters arising from the review is proposed for 2024.

However, in 2024 the government used the proposed independent review of the Integrity Commission as a grounds to delay any Integrity Commission reforms. We are now in 2025. The government has squibbed on that review and we still do not have a date for the Integrity Commission reform bill.

As was outlined by other members, the government argued that they had:

sought and have received advice regarding that proposed review and that it is in the government's view that the appointment of an independent reviewer to conduct a review of the Integrity Commission may be in conflict with that function.

That advice has never been made public. The government has also argued that a review is not possible because the legislation provides for the Cox review to take place and that has already been conducted; therefore, no further review could take place. Not only is that nonsense on the face of it but the 2022 discussion paper not only considered the Cox review matters but raised additional matters to be reviewed so, clearly, the legislation does not prevent an additional review taking place. The notion that the government would be prohibited from reviewing legislation is absurd and, of course, they are not. It would be virtually impossible to ever amend legislation without a review of some form.

Some matters in the Cox review we are waiting on include the amending of the definition of 'serious misconduct' to clarify what a serious offence is. That is in order to ensure the purview of the commission is clear by requiring:

mandatory notification by public authorities of serious misconduct and misconduct of the designated public officers to the commission in a timely manner. 

It is remarkable that, after almost 10 years, this has still not been introduced. We are also still waiting on the act to be amended so the commission:

retains jurisdiction over a complaint even after referral to the appropriate person or entity for action, such jurisdiction to include the powers within those Parts. 

This is to ensure that the commission has a jurisdiction over the action in relation to a referred complaint is adequate. Given the commission of inquiry examined a referred complaint where the response of the department was poor, the importance of this reform should be self-evident. 

These are just a few of the 49 unimplemented recommendations. Many of these are clearly substantial deficits of the act and it is remarkable that nine years after these recommendations were made, they remain unactioned.

This is not just an academic argument. We have seen the failure to act on the Cox review in a timely manner, and it is all still silent on what we are doing in terms of the Weiss review, the funding for the recommendations and how they are going to be rolled out and the timeline for that to be done. It is simply unacceptable, and now there is another Tasmania Police member under investigation.
The Greens support Mr Jenner's motion but we have some amendments to strengthen it. These have been circulated to members.

Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the motion be amended to omit paragraph (2) and insert instead the following paragraphs:

(2)	Calls on the government to implement all the recommendations outlined in appendix A of the 2022 Integrity Commission Act 2009 legislative reform discussion paper as a matter of priority to ensure the implementation by the end of the 2025 calendar year, and

(3)	Orders the government to report back to the House by the end of September 2025 on any progress and actions taken in respect of clause 2 of this motion, and

(4)	Notes that the continued inaction after 10 years of doing nothing will be totally unacceptable to the parliament and to the Tasmanian community

The amendment is not a substantial change to Mr Jenner's words or intent. Our amendment to the motion changes the provision of clause 2 in the - . Oh, do I have to wait for that? 

The SPEAKER - Wait for?

Ms BADGER - In moving that motion?

The SPEAKER - You can move it now and then you will be speaking to it from the moment you move it or you can move it at the end of your contribution. 

Ms BADGER - I apologise. I thought I did it before and then I rushed on to the next part.

[6.27 p.m.]
Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the motion be amended - 

The SPEAKER - To move the motion as circulated. I can just call a vote on that now. 

Amendment agreed to.

The SPEAKER - We are now debating the motion as amended. 

Ms BADGER - As I read before, the motion changes the provisions to clause (2), what was paragraph (b), to be an order, that is that the government does not have to comply with the call, as stated previously, but they do have to with an order. While the House cannot order the government to implement recommendations, we can order them to report back to the House. 

 [Bookmark: Phr3_O=33.2_D=18.5_C=0.79] Similarly, our amendment corrects the reference in clause (2). I note the member for Lyons, minister Barnett, also spoke to this. That the Integrity Commission's discussion paper, as I understand it, was a Department of Justice paper. 

[6.29 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Attorney-General) -  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=53.2_D=7.9_C=0.87]  [Bookmark: Phr5_O=64.0_D=11.0_C=0.82] Honourable Speaker, I do not want to take up too much time. We do not support the Greens' amendment, but we do support the motion. To suggest that we are -

The SPEAKER - [Bookmark: Phr6_O=76.2_D=1.0_C=0.96]  Just on the amendment.

Mr BARNETT - On the amendment.

The SPEAKER - My apologies. The amendment has been agreed to and you did not speak to the amendment. This would now be a second substantive contribution so I will give the call to someone else. My apologies. That was my mistake. You could have jumped before I put the vote. You can ask the Clerk.

Mr BARNETT - but the member has been standing and then stood down and then I jumped.

The SPEAKER - Yes, and had you been following the debate you would note that she put her amendment. We had the vote. It passed. We are now back to an amended motion which is now the substantive motion. Therefore, you do not get a second opportunity. You can give your notes to someone else if you would like their contribution but, otherwise, that is the advice. You do not get a chance to speak.

Mr BARNETT - Yes. I am noting that we have acted and will continue to do so.

The SPEAKER - No, you cannot make that contribution because you do not have support.  [Bookmark: Phr7_O=95.4_D=3.2_C=0.76] 

Motion, as amended, agreed to.


MOTION

Labor Party Alternative Budget 2025

[6.30 p.m.]
Mr BEHRAKIS (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I require a vote. I move -

That the House -

Recognises that in the 11 years they have been in Opposition, the Labor Party have failed to deliver a single alternative Budget. 

Notes that on 11 September 2024, the House called on Labor to detail their $2 billion of election campaign ‘savings’ and provide to the House a detailed alternative Budget by the end of the parliamentary Budget session. 
Further notes that the Leader of the Opposition Hon. Dean Winter MP failed to comply with the will of the House. 

Calls on the Labor Opposition to provide the House with a detailed alternative Budget by 5 June 2025.
 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=121.8_D=4.7_C=0.67] 
 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=155.3_D=1.8_C=0.78] I rise today to expose once again Labor's failure to do the most basic job of any opposition: provide a costed alternative budget. In 11 years, the Tasmanian Labor Party has not delivered one single alternative budget. Not one: not when they opposed investment; not during COVID; not during a time of cost-of-living concerns for Tasmanians; not even [Bookmark: Phr16_O=200.6_D=4.7_C=0.88]  after this House called on them to do it. 

I remember standing here [Bookmark: Phr17_O=205.9_D=26.6_C=0.81]  and the shadow treasurer sitting over there, laughing, because he thought the motion would not get up, and it did. However, they have refused to respect the will of the House and act on it. On 11 September 2n24, this House demanded that Labor explain its $2 billion in campaign savings and table a proper costed alternative budget. What did we get from Mr Winter and Mr Willie [Bookmark: Phr18_O=233.4_D=1.8_C=0.92] ? Silence, excuses [Bookmark: Phr19_O=235.7_D=0.9_C=0.66]  and evasion [Bookmark: Phr20_O=237.6_D=1.3_C=0.68] . Let us be  [Bookmark: Phr21_O=239.6_D=3.6_C=0.75] very clear: Mr Winter and Mr Willie have deliberately ignored the will of this parliament.

 [Bookmark: Phr22_O=244.6_D=25.1_C=0.70] Mr Willie, Tasmania's so-called shadow treasurer, cannot even produce a spreadsheet, let alone manage a budget. Maybe he was scared off by Dr Broad. This is an absolute dereliction of duty. If you want to criticise, you need to show what you would do instead. You need to provide an alternative. Labor refuses to do so because it has no plan. 

Contrast that with our record. Under the Rockliff Liberal government, Tasmania is delivering [Bookmark: Phr23_O=270.5_D=8.5_C=0.59] : $40.6 billion gross state product, our highest ever; 47,300 jobs created since 2014 [Bookmark: Phr24_O=280.1_D=24.8_C=0.77] ; 3.9 per cent unemployment, a record low, which is a drastic difference from when Labor was last on this side of the House; and first in business confidence for two months in a row. Tasmania is leading the nation in economic growth. State final demand is up 3 per cent. Retail trade and exports are at record highs, and wages are growing faster than the national average. This does not happen by accident. It happened because the government has a plan. That is a plan for the economy, the service and for Tasmanian families.

Meanwhile, what is Labor's record? When Labor was last in government, Tasmania had the worst business confidence in the nation. Businesses said the government was working against them. There was a recession and there was phenomenal unemployment. Unemployment was twice what we have now.

Labor's current plan was exposed in the last session of parliament, when the opposition voted to legislate higher own-source revenue targets. In plain speak, that means tax hikes and increased fees and charges, or reduced services - $2.7 billion in tax hikes by 2027-28. That is $1.85 million a day ripped from Tasmanian families and businesses, hidden behind those vague slogans like 'maximising government business profits', which is code for high power bills and stealth charges. Mr Willie should explain how taxing Tasmanians into the ground is fiscal discipline. 

Let us not forget their $4 billion election con, funded by $2 billion in phantom cuts and 11 revisions and corrections to their costings during the election.

What of the Leader of the Opposition? This is a man who dodges parliamentary orders, as we are discussing today - 

Mr Winter - Hang on. What parliamentary order did I dodge?

Mr BEHRAKIS - has refused to table a budget, has a history of backing the privatisation of public assets behind closed doors -

Mr WINTER - Honourable Speaker, point of order.

The SPEAKER - I am going to hear the point of order.

Mr Willie - It was not an order.

The SPEAKER - Mr Willie, I cannot hear the point of order.

Mr WINTER - I am concerned that the member for Clark has just said that I have dodged a parliamentary order. I would not like to do it. Can he clarify what he means by dodging a parliamentary order?

The SPEAKER - Mr Behrakis is making a substantive allegation and he has a form of the House to do so. However, I remind him that he is not to suggest anything that may offend the member.

Mr BEHRAKIS - Okay, I will retract 'order' in the interest of making sure that we are being correct here. He has ignored the parliament calling on them to table an alternative budget. He has ignored the will of the parliament, has a history of backing the privatisation of public assets on one hand, behind closed doors, but cannot be upfront about it in public, and cannot even really be clear about where, in fact, he was born.

Labor's economic plan boils down to this: they complain loudly, they tax heavily, they deliver nothing. They call on the government to increase funding and all manner of things on one side, and try to say that the government is spending too much on the other side.

Tasmania does not need a 'tax first, ask later' Labor-Greens experiment. We need responsible, disciplined economic management, which is exactly what we are delivering and have been delivering. This month, we will release a fully costed, transparent 2025-26 Budget with a clear plan for health, housing, education and economic growth, as well as how we are going to pay for it. 

Labor has no budget, no plan, no credibility. Today, I again call on Mr Winter and Mr Willie. Stop hiding, stop pretending, stop trying to have it both ways. Respect the will of the House. If you think you are an alternative government, prove it. Deliver a real detailed cost alternative by 5 June 2025 because Tasmanians deserve better than your cheap headlines. They deserve an actual alternative. They deserve a government with a plan, and they have one with this Liberal government.

[6.36 p.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I will do my best to respond to this motion because we all know that this is the Liberal Party and their friends in the Greens movement working together here. They like to write works of fiction when they are in opposition. We know the Greens try to tax anything they do not like and cut anything out of the budget and destroy jobs. It is quite entertaining reading when they write a work of fiction. We know when the Liberals were in opposition, they wrote works of fiction, too. We know that the assumptions that they baked into their alternative budgets never came to fruition. We know that Peter Gutwein, as shadow treasurer, may have been the first example for Peter Dutton to follow. He said: 'I am going to cut 500 jobs. I am not going to tell you where they are, though. We are just going to do it, and I will tell you after the election.'

They are on a unity ticket, writing works of fiction from opposition with their so-called alternative budgets. It is the height of hypocrisy for members on that side to march in here and say, 'You should do an alternative budget'. They cannot even keep their own budget for five months. They cannot even keep their own assumptions for five months. How would somebody possibly do an alternative budget based on their own assumptions? The numbers are moving around so quickly that they do not even stay in the same place for five months. Everything is out of date, and they are coming back in this place and asking for half-a-billion dollars on the credit card. 

It is the height of hypocrisy to be lectured by members on the other side about budget responsibility and being honest with numbers when they cannot do it themselves with the full resources of government - Treasury, the departments, with all their assumptions. They cannot even do it for five months. They spent $4 million a day in the lead up to coming back to this place and asking for more money.

It does not happen anywhere else in the country. We have parliamentary budget offices in some jurisdictions. They have access to the departments on behalf of the crossbench and the opposition members. That is a fair system. Parliamentary budget offices have been quite successful in the jurisdictions they have been established in. The process is that opposition and crossbench members, whether they are Liberal or Labor, are able to go to the parliamentary budget office and say, 'We are thinking about this idea', and the parliamentary budget office is allowed to work with the departments on their assumptions and the models that they have around policies and things like that, and come back and provide that information to opposition and crossbench members.

Perhaps the member for Clark is talking about supporting a parliamentary budget office so that all members have access to Treasury and departments. Perhaps that is what he means by this motion.

Tasmanians do not care for political games on alternative budgets by the Liberal Party at this time of year. They care about the real budget, the budget that delivers the services they rely upon and the economy that gives them opportunities. This government's track record is abysmal. The state's finances are in the worst shape they have ever been in. The economy is flatlining, propped up by public sector debt spending. We have young working-age people leaving in droves. We have public services at breaking point. No wonder they want somebody else to create some document to distract from their own record. That is what this is about. 

I know the Greens are going to vote for it, but to crossbenchers who may be newer to this place, I say, this is a game that gets played every single year at this time by those opposite because they want a distraction. Tasmanians care about the real Tasmanian budget, and those opposite do not like the focus on it because they cannot defend it.
Why can they not defend it? It is things like the credit rating agencies; it is not me as shadow treasurer. They like to say that I am Mr Negative, which is completely untrue. I love Tasmania. They conveniently ignore all the data and all of the other analysts that are contributing to the economic debate in Tasmania. The credit agencies have been scathing about this government. S&P and Moody's have downgraded Tasmania's outlook from stable to negative. They have set thresholds for this government in terms of credit rating downgrades. That means we are going to be paying higher interest rates on their record debt.

That is money that is not going to schools and hospitals because this government cannot manage the budget. It is $500 million in the last year of the forward Estimates in the budget delivered last year. That is not to pay the debt off; that is just to service it. We know it is going to be worse this year. It is going to be a whole lot worse this year because we have a treasurer who talks about some mythical pathway to surplus, but he has provided no evidence of that.

We had respected economist Saul Eslake say the only evidence he can see of a pathway to surplus is if you turn the charts upside down. He may talk about some mythical pathway to surplus, but he actually needs a cash surplus. He is talking about a net operating balance surplus. He needs a cash surplus to stop the Liberals' ballooning debt. It is out of control under this government, and until he delivers a cash surplus it will not be stabilised. 

We will certainly be setting that test for him in the state budget. We are certainly setting him a test in terms of assumptions. We know that they have cooked the books for too long. We have heard some statements from the Treasurer in this place that he wants to have a good look at the assumptions in the budget to make sure that they are achievable, and will certainly be having a close look at that. [Bookmark: Phr2_O=7.7_D=29.8_C=0.78] 

This is nothing but a stunt. It is the Liberals colluding with their friends, the Greens. The Leader of the Greens is probably now the most senior lower House Greens' member anywhere in Australia. 

Mr Winter - Well, congratulations. 

Mr WILLIE - Yes, congratulations to her. She probably has realised that position today with the Australian Greens leader losing his seat because of their extremism. The Australian people have rejected the Greens. 

Mr Winter - Did he do an alternate budget?

Mr WILLIE -  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=37.8_D=8.1_C=0.72] Yes, and we have the Liberal Party in here trying to lecture other people in the wake of the federal result. You would think they would be a little bit more circumspect [Bookmark: Phr4_O=47.7_D=19.3_C=0.77] . Their economic credibility has been smashed all over the country. We saw them absolutely destroy the federal budget and leave one almighty mess for the Labor Party to manage, and we have seen them absolutely destroy Tasmania's finances. I am not going to be lectured to by them.

 [Bookmark: Phr5_O=67.5_D=19.3_C=0.74] The Labor Party will outline our plan in our own time with our own agenda. We have said that this year we will start to outline some fiscal measures, because the current trajectory cannot continue. I am not going to be dictated to by them. 

[6.44 p.m.]
Mrs BESWICK (Braddon) - [Bookmark: Phr6_O=94.7_D=26.4_C=0.80]  Deputy Speaker, I rise today in support of this motion. The people of Tasmania deserve transparency, they deserve greater leadership, they certainly deserve accountability and they deserve a high standard of political debate. The motion asks the Labor's opposition: where is your alternative budget? This is not a trick question; it is not a political theatre. It is a very simple proposition. If you seek to govern, show us you can. [Bookmark: Phr7_O=122.5_D=8.0_C=0.81]  Show us you are ready, because at the moment you are asking Tasmanians to take you at your word without giving them anything concrete to stand on.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=131.8_D=28.6_C=0.77] On 11 September last year, this House passed a clear and unambiguous motion calling on the Labor Party to detail their election commitments, quantify their savings and provide a viable alternative budget. It is not a partisan issue for me. I am not here to blindly back the government. I am an independent and I take that seriously. I will hold any government to account. I will scrutinise every budget, and I will absolutely challenge and question how public money is being spent.

 [Bookmark: Phr9_O=160.8_D=20.6_C=0.84] The alternative government also deserves scrutiny, because if Labor wants to present itself as the next government in Tasmania, then it must articulate a clear plan for budget repair. They must show they understand the complexity and the gravity of fiscal decision-making, and they must demonstrate that their plans are costed, credible and comprehensive [Bookmark: Phr10_O=182.3_D=30.0_C=0.80] . 

Tasmania's economy is at a crossroads. We are facing real pressures - cost of living, housing affordability, regional infrastructure deficits, health system strain, education strain. These are not silly talking points. They are Tasmania's challenges and they demand Tasmanian solutions. Every political party and our independents should be clear about our priorities and values, but when you are making the pitch to govern, you need to back up claims with solid evidence, otherwise it is just puff and promotion.

 [Bookmark: Phr11_O=214.1_D=10.9_C=0.88] The motion passed in September was not a suggestion. It was not a press release. It was a directive of this parliament backed by the majority of its members. When the House speaks, all members have a duty to respond. [Bookmark: Phr12_O=227.2_D=10.5_C=0.72]  If Mr Winter believes the government's budget is flawed, then say so. Show us the flaws; prove there is a better way. Do not stand in the corner and throw stones. Correct.

 [Bookmark: Phr13_O=238.6_D=8.6_C=0.86] I believe Saturday's election result - which Labor MPs should rightly celebrate - shows that voters will reject an opposition that does not look ready to govern. [Bookmark: Phr14_O=248.3_D=7.5_C=0.69]  Peter Dutton and the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, have been widely criticised for not offering an alternative economic vision for the country. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=256.8_D=6.0_C=0.85]  I am sure the opposition leader here does not want to attract the same assessment when he leads his party to the polls for the first time.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=263.6_D=14.9_C=0.76] I hope the prospect of developing an alternative budget is being considered in opposition offices. As Mr Willie has said, he is interested in detail and reform. He has put forward sensible suggestions in line with the report handed down by Saul Eslake and  [Bookmark: Phr17_O=279.6_D=23.9_C=0.78] he has clearly said he would love a parliamentary budget office, as I would. I would quite enjoy that. 

A proper alternative budget would give Tasmanians a chance to make a considered judgment. It is easy to highlight the budget mess we are in, but it is more difficult to fix it. It is easy for an opposition to point out areas that deserve increased public funding; it is much more difficult to identify how we pay for it. That is a challenge I am strongly aware of and why I am reluctant to call on the government to make big spending commitments. We simply cannot afford it.

I am supporting this motion today because I genuinely believe it is in the public's interest. Let us have a contest of ideas and a robust debate about how we repair the budget mess. An alternative plan from the party that wants to be the next government is not a big ask.

[6.49 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Treasurer) - Deputy Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to support the member for Clark's, Mr Behrakis, very fine motion. It makes a lot of sense. It is consistent, it is logical, and it is calling for an alternative budget by the opposition leader, Mr Winter, with the support of the opposition Treasury spokesperson. It has been 11 years and not one alternative Budget has been delivered to date and not one costed policy has been delivered to date.

We get a lot of criticism and we get a lot of relentless negativity from the opposition. What we do know is at the election time they came up with $2 billion worth of cuts, but that has never been detailed. That should be detailed. They talk about its savings since the election time; so why do you not put it in writing, open and transparent for all to see, to provide this House the opportunity to speak to and comment on?

I wanted to concur with the remarks of the member for Braddon, who has just shared her contribution. It makes eminent sense and, of course, we have a Budget coming up in just a few weeks' time. I am looking forward to that Budget with confidence, with some level of excitement, because it will deliver support for a strong economy. It will deliver responsible economic management and you will see that pathway to surplus. We hear criticism from the other side and elsewhere, amongst their relentless negativity, because it will be there in black and white.

I am really confident about delivering that pathway to surplus. We work very hard and we are backing in business, we are backing in industry and that is why I stood, for example, together at the Treasury buildings with the registration of interest process just a few days ago. We were backed by industry. We were backed by the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce & Industry (TCCI), by the Master Builders, by the Tasmanian Hospitality Association, and I thank Paul Jubb and Michael Bailey for being there on the day in support, and by the Tourism Industry Council. This initiative was howled down and criticised by Labor and the Greens when I put it forward last year before Christmas.

Mr WINTER - And the other two times you have announced it, the same thing.

Mr BARNETT - No, they were so negative on it. They could not get through their relentless negativity to say, 'Congratulations, well done, good initiative, get on with the job.' Well, we are getting on with the job. We have made that announcement and we are getting on with the job.

You have seen the positivity there. It is backed by industry, backed by business. It is the same with respect to our GBE reforms. It is backed by industry, backed by business and I want to say thank you to the industry stakeholders who I meet with regularly with respect to those reforms and other reforms.

We have the Red Tape Reduction Industry Task Force; further meetings coming up in future days. I am really looking forward to working with them and getting that feedback. It is time for Labor to step up and provide an alternative budget.

The member for Braddon and the member for Clark, in their earlier remarks, made mention of the motion last year - that has not been complied with by the Leader for the Opposition - to provide an alternative Budget. Mr Winter has failed to comply with the alternative Budget. He says one thing one day and another thing the next. We do not know where he was born exactly, so he can come forward. He can clarify that tonight and make it very clear. 

We know that he is a closet supporter of privatisation because we have it on the public record. He supported privatisation, but now he is amongst other Labor mates and of course unions, perhaps he is not so supportive. That is a matter for you, but you cannot say one thing one day and another thing the next. It does not make sense.

We are all about building the economy, and that is why we have now got a $40 billion gross state product, and that is why that has grown more than 26 per cent since we have been in government. In terms of growth, that state final demand, we are very pleased with a recent report noting a very significant, more than 3 per cent, increase. Record low unemployment - we have 47,000 new jobs. Business confidence number one by National Australia Bank. So why do you not acknowledge the positives? The relentless negativity is seeping through and it must be very hard for you to continue to do that. Come forward, be open and transparent like we have been.

We have the record-breaking retail trade, again in March, more than 700 million, the highest ever; exports 4.6 billion to March, up 3.8 per cent year on year and up 66 per cent since 2014. I say thank you to our productive industries, to our manufacturing industries and to other exporters doing the job. I am pleased and proud - my late dad was the Tasmanian exporter of the year back in the early 1980s and I am proud of my dad for that. Anyone involved in the export industry, it is fantastic. In terms of red tape, we are getting on with the job. We have a host of reforms now, and again backed by industry, backed by business.

In terms of the Red Tape Reduction Industry Task Force, I am looking forward to meeting with them in coming days. We are not stopping. We are getting on with job of removing the red tape, streamlining the process, letting business get on with doing what they need to do. We have got an audit of all state and local licences, permits and approvals to ensure we remove any unnecessary barriers preventing economic growth and job creation. We are slashing red tape in the construction industry. It is clear we have established the Efficiency and Productivity Unit.

In terms of productivity, I note the federal Treasurer's support for improved productivity. He said that on Sunday night as part of a key plank of the federal Labor government's policy over the next three years. This has been our plan for some time and we are getting on with the job. We are repealing unnecessary and burdensome legislation. We are single-form tendering. I am very pleased to have that support from the Electrical Contractors Association, standing with them, shoulder to shoulder, to make that announcement a month or so ago.

The Small Business Start-Up Permit, that is fantastic; enabling small business to trial their concept for 12 months with a single permit and of course the Premier announced that. The TCCI indicated, from its perspective, that was a world-leading, globally-leading initiative and we acknowledge that. We have the new Red Tape Reduction Portal, and I can give you an indication: that is working. We are getting that feedback and we are getting on with responding to that.

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order. 

Mr BARNETT - In terms of the health sector, the new patient alerts, management solutions as well. They are all great examples of our government getting on with the job, delivering for the people of Tasmania. It is high time for the opposition to come forward and deliver an alternative budget. Not one costed policy, not one alternative budget in 11 years. It is high time they stepped up and it seems that tonight they have indicated that they do not plan to deliver an alternative budget. I ask them to reconsider, to step forward and reconsider their position in terms of the secret plans to tax Tasmanian residents and businesses. That is not on.

Two days ago, I released analysis that made it very clear that under a Tasmanian Labor government, households and businesses would be hit with an additional $2.7 billion in taxes by the end of 2027-28. That is $1.85 million a day taken from Tasmanians' pockets every single day for the next three years. It was clear, in the last session of Parliament, Labor voted to legislate higher own-source revenue targets; in plain terms, tax hikes well above existing levels. That is what that is all about. I have made it clear; I said it a few days ago and we have heard nothing from state Labor. I hope today you can release your figures and statistics, because we know what that means [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=17.5_C=0.63]  - that is $2.7  billion more in taxes on everyday Tasmanians. That is not fiscal discipline; that is raiding a family budget and hurting small business. Come forward and release your statistics and your financial analysis, because [Bookmark: Phr3_O=49.4_D=10.2_C=0.82]  that is clearly what it shows. 

In addition to that, the opposition leader made it clear he wanted to 'maximise the profits' of government businesses. [Bookmark: Phr4_O=59.9_D=29.7_C=0.75]  We know what that means. Tasmanians will pay more. We have a team Tasmania approach for the GBE reform process and we know how important that is, but state Labor have a plan to maximise profits from those government businesses, and that means Tasmanians will pay more. 

They will pay it through the neck in [Bookmark: Phr5_O=89.9_D=30.0_C=0.79]  higher taxes, higher charges, whether it is bus fares or other charges that are relevant to the Tasmanian people. It is not on. It is time that they came forward and delivered their plans in an open and transparent way for Tasmanians, and identify how big these cuts are going to be or how high those taxes are going to be. It is high time they stepped up, delivered an alternative budget and complied with the [Bookmark: Phr6_O=120.0_D=2.4_C=0.84]  will of this Chamber. 

[6.59 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to talk to this motion, and I will start by using some words from the member for Clark and quote them back to him. It is a very curious way to get our support to spend a good chunk of your debate attacking us over various –

Mr Willie - You are not going to support it anyway. Do not pretend you are.

Mr BAYLEY - How do you know that? I have not even got to my feet.

Mr Winter - Because we did this exact same motion six months ago.
Mr BAYLEY -  [Bookmark: Phr10_O=156.3_D=29.5_C=0.67] A curious way of doing that. The Greens publish an alternative budget every year, and while you all criticise it -

A member - Of sorts. Yes, that is right.

Mr BAYLEY - Yes, you criticise it, but at least it demonstrates our bona fides around putting an alternative vision forward for the money and the budget in this state. We can be judged by that; we take your criticisms on the jaw and we will [Bookmark: Phr11_O=186.4_D=26.1_C=0.81]  fire back about them. We will continue to do that because we believe it is an important principle for those who sit on the opposition benches to be putting forward their proposition around how we would manage the budget going forward. 

There is plenty to criticise about the government's budget and the Labor opposition are very good at it. You are very good at banging on about [Bookmark: Phr12_O=213.2_D=15.6_C=0.58]  debt. You are very good at pointing at the issues, and we are quite often on the same page about this. You are pointing at debt, pointing at the cuts, pointing at the efficiency dividends, pointing at the vacancy controls, questioning abou [Bookmark: Phr13_O=229.5_D=29.4_C=0.79] t our frontline services. That is entirely legitimate and I do not want to diminish the work you do in that space, but if you are going to do that, it is important to put your alternative vision on the table. 

While you bang on about debt and while you criticise the government about those issues, you are still backing the government, come what may, writing a blank cheque when it comes to this stadium, which will have a humungous impact on the budget - $1.86 billion [Bookmark: Phr14_O=259.3_D=26.5_C=0.83]  over 10 years added to debt, $76 million a year to service. That is genuine money. Yes, it is a one-off capital payment, but it is going to cost us every single year going forward, and what it does is deliver intergenerational debt. It will burden our children and potentially our grandchildren with debt for many years to come. It is a loss-making venture. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=286.6_D=1.6_C=0.83]  It returns barely more than 50 cents in the dollar invested in it. It is a bad investment, notwithstanding the issues associated with the city and heritage and the like. 

While you are very good at criticising the government, we think it is important that you put your money where your mouth is and actually demonstrate what you would do as an alternative. To be putting yourselves forward as the alternative government, it is important to make sure that  you have a full suite of alternative policies. That includes an alternative budget; that includes articulating where you would spend the money, where you would save the money and how you would fund the services that we all need and deserve.

We will back you on scrutiny. We will back you on transparency, as we did today. We will back you in calling on this government to actually put information on the table about its budget, its finances, and how it is managing taxpayer dollars. None of this is our money. This is Tasmanians' collectively. It is the taxpayers' dollar and it is critically important.

In September 2024 a motion was passed calling on you, the Labor opposition, to publish an alternative budget. Yes, a motion that calls on you does not compel you to comply with it, but it is certainly an expectation. It is an expectation that you at least give it a crack. This current motion from the member for Clark recognises that you have not done an alternative budget in the 11 years that you have been in opposition -

Mr WINTER - Nor has any opposition in Australia.

Mr BAYLEY - It notes that the House called on you to produce one back in 2024. It notes that you have not complied with that and it calls on you again to do it. The budget will be handed down on 29 May. That is when the government puts all of its cards on the table. Following that, we Greens will put our cards on the table through our leader, Dr Woodruff, publishing the alternative budget and presenting it here in the House. We will cop all your criticisms on the chin, but we will take them. It really is incumbent upon you as the alternative government to do a similar thing, to actually publish a document.

Mr Willie - You know the federal Greens tried to lecture Labor. How did that work out?

Mr BAYLEY - We are not talking about elections, mate. We are talking about an alternative budget. You can all crow -

Members interjecting.

Mr BAYLEY - We support this motion. We think the opposition should publish an alternative budget. We think that the will of the House, as expressed in September last year, should be respected. It is not a job that is beyond you. We do it every year. The least that you can do for the Tasmanian people as an alternative government is to publish an alternative budget.

[7.05 p.m.]
Mr WINTER - Deputy Speaker, I was not going to speak but I cannot help myself, hearing some of the earlier contributions.

This motion, as pointed out by the Deputy Leader of the Greens just then - if it is not word for word, then it is close. A pretty similar motion was passed what, six months ago? It is only the new Standing Orders that - under the old Standing Orders they would not have been able to move the exact same or a pretty similar motion again.

Yet, here we are. We have a government with a backbench restricted to doing ridiculous motions like this, and then standing up here in the debate for six minutes to argue the point. They only get one hour per week to do their backbench government members' time. Only one hour. The member for Clark had a full 30 minutes, if I am not mistaken, and he spoke for six minutes on Labor. I have to tell you, it was embarrassing.

Members interjecting.

Mr Behrakis- You said this last time.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order.

Mr WINTER - When he is asked to read speeches that are given to him by the Treasurer's office or the Premier's office, the first thing he should do is read them. Just have a quick glance at it and see if what you are about to read out is something that you really want to stand behind. The member for Clark stood here today and talked about business confidence from 11 years ago.

I want to read a report that came out yesterday, from Roy Morgan Business Confidence. The highlight - or the lowlight, I should say - is Tasmania's performance. It is a performance that now lags behind the rest of the country. It is down significantly on their rating scale to 86.4 points, down 17.1 points since April last year -or since the so-called 'Strong Plan' came into place. That is what this government is doing.

This is a government that wants to talk about its economic credentials. Since this government went into minority, 7000 full-time Tasmanian jobs have been lost. This is a premier who said that minority government would wreck the economy. He is putting on a showcase of what poor leadership does, and what a premier who cannot deliver what he says actually does to an economy.

When the member for Clark talked about business complaining that the government was working against them 11 years ago, I could only think of the comments from the TCCI late last year, when they said it will be hard to ever trust this government again. What they meant by that was that the Spirit of Tasmania debacle had been such a debacle, such an absolute disgrace, that they could not trust this premier and this government to ever deliver anything ever again.

That is the level of confidence they have. The government has been standing in this place this week trying to talk about building a stadium, which I support and which Tasmanian Labor supports. We support building a stadium, but every time I hear an answer, I question whether this government is actually able to deliver things. Are they actually able to deliver a large project like that? Are they able to deliver the projects and the policies that they announce? It was late last year that the Premier talked about amalgamating three of our GBEs - TT-Line, TasRail and TasPorts.

Mr Willie - What happened to that?

Mr WINTER - What did happen to that? That is quite right, member for Clark and shadow treasurer.

Mr Willie - A thought bubble.

Mr WINTER - Where did it go? We had such a crisis in GBE reform that this government decided they were going to do something about it. The GBEs had been failing to deliver the very basics - the fundamentals. We had GBEs that could not talk to each other and they were told by the shareholder minister to go and play more nicely together in the sandpit. That was the level of governance. We had a premier who said, 'We are going to fix it; we are going to do this governance reform'. That was more than six months ago.

Where is it? They said they are going to amalgamate three of our GBEs, but where is it? I understand it has been scrapped. I asked the Premier this question only a few weeks ago with no clear answer.

Mr Willie - They are selling them now.

Mr WINTER - Well, they are selling them. Now, we talk about strong plans. One day they are reforming, the next day they are selling. I will tell you what, Tasmanian Labor wants to fix these GBEs. We actually want to make them work better for the Tasmanian people. It is up to Tasmania to have a government that is prepared to actually fix the problems; not sell the problems, not talk about one level of reform and then drop it like a hot potato six months later - at least we think that is what they have done, but we cannot get a clear answer. 
What is their clear answer on these issues? It is to do stunt motions like this from the member for Clark. Seeking an alternative budget has been an 11-year crusade from the Liberals, knowing full well that no opposition in Australia does an alternative budget. None. David Crisafulli did not do an alternative budget. Brad Battin will not do an alternative budget this year. Peter Dutton - remember him - does not do an alternative budget.

This is a complete fabrication and a fiction, and the reason they do it is to try to talk about something that is not their own budget. Their budget is not a pathway to surplus; it is a pathway towards $10 billion worth of net debt. You have a treasurer delivering it whose first act as treasurer was to bring to this place a supplementary appropriation for an extra half-a-billion dollars this financial year. He wants to talk about who is a good financial manager but he cannot manage his own budget, so he wants to create the distraction to talk about something else.

There is one group that does it for him every year. Congratulations to the Tasmanian Greens for doing it, because every year they help create the distraction and they stand here with their silly alternative budget that says they are going to tax more in the mining sector, but what they do not accept is that if you tax more then you are actually going to put pressure on those businesses. They say they are going to shut down the salmon industry but still accept all the revenue that goes into the budget. They create the distraction every year.

The Greens help to distract from the key issue, which is the actual budget that actually hurts people. That is what is important to our state. You have a government that wants to distract, a Greens party that likes to help them, and a Tasmanian Labor Party that actually wants to hold them to account. We have been talking about this for years. We have a long-term fiscal outlook from Treasury that talked about this exact issue. They said that the size of the corrective action by not doing anything just made the problem worse. That was in 2021, and lo and behold, just like Treasury, their financial advisers said every year they do this, the problem gets worse.

I heard the inaugural speech from the Leader of the House this year where he talked passionately about his thoughts on debt and deficit and being responsible, and I watched him as he heard the Treasurer's speech doing the exact opposite of everything he said was important and clear to him. Then he said - what was it? 'Labor lite Liberal losers'. 

This is someone who has made his entire career about being a fiscal conservative, and he is sitting there behind a treasurer who he is going to hand down yet another record deficit and continue to grow the debt, and cannot say when the debt will stop growing. We have asked him this question. Matt Denholm famously asked this question of the treasurer and the Premier in the budget lockup: 'When will the debt stop growing?' Actually, it might have been the previous treasurer, then minister Ferguson. I apologise to this Treasurer.

They could not answer then. They cannot answer in the parliament and his pathway to surplus is highly unlikely to stop the debt from growing. This is a government which has completely lost control of Tasmania's budget.

I want to talk about the contribution from Mrs Beswick. I heard the contribution she made to the last debate as well. It is lovely to see good guests here in the gallery, honourable Deputy Speaker. It is one thing for the Greens to say we should do an alternative budget. They do one, so I understand that. It is not hypocritical at all, but I do find it a bit galling to hear from the member for Braddon that Labor should do an alternative budget, having stood for a party that literally had not a single policy at the last state election. Let us face it, that party will not produce an alternative budget here either.

The important part about our budget is what is actually delivered for Tasmanians, and what is the long-term outlook of doing nothing for our state. Every year the size of corrective action gets larger, meaning that Tasmania's budget comes under more pressure. We already know that under the last Budget that was handed down, around half-a-billion dollars every year will be spent just servicing the debt. It means that important projects and programs come under more pressure. 

It means that infrastructure budgets get squeezed more tightly, and it is putting it on the credit card for Tasmania's future, for the children of the future to pay for the sort of reckless spending that we have heard about just today - grants programs that give out AirPods and iPhones and iPods or whatever else was in that. Glass cabinets. We support small business, but we understand that small business does not need a few hundred businesses to get these small grants. They want a government that is competent, that is able to deliver projects. They are down to their last bit. This is all they think they can do - just hand out money, because they cannot deliver the projects. You have a government that is unable to deliver on the bare basics of their policies.

This has been a waste of the parliament's time because we already debated it last year. We know what the outcome is going to be, but we do know something really important, and that is that Tasmanians are looking for change. They are looking for a change in the way Tasmania is governed and they are looking for a new government.

We are seriously concerned about this upcoming Budget and what it is going to do to services. We are seriously concerned about the way that they are managing their cuts. We are seriously concerned about the fact that we are here in May and we need to try to order information from the government about their efficiency dividends. We are concerned about the job freezes. I am concerned when I get letters from people telling me that their children cannot get access to speech pathologists because the government is freezing speech pathology and the recruitment of new people in those positions. That is what Liberal government budget management actually looks like. That is how it actually hurts people in the community, people who are working in sectors that rely on funding.

I had representatives from a really important community organisation in my office today who told me about some really critical programs that they are running in Tasmanian government schools. They told me that they are about to be defunded, in their view, that they do not see any future; all of the messaging they have heard from government is that their funding is about to be cut.

I am concerned about the state of this Budget and what it is going to do to all of those organisations. What happens when you start spending hundreds of millions of dollars just paying down the debt, that is hundreds of millions of dollars in spending that cannot be spent in schools, in hospitals, in the community sector. That is not something that we can fix overnight. That is something that is built up not only over 11 years, it is actually only built up over the last three years. This is record deficit, after record deficit building up to record debt. 

A government that still has the gall after all of that, to stand in this place and say they are good financial managers; they must be joking. There have never been worse financial managers of a government than what we have seen over the last three years; reckless spending; just completely wheels off. No fiscal discipline. A treasurer who had to stand down. A premier who has lost control, cannot deliver projects, announces reforms and then just simply seems to scrap them. They disappear. What happened to some of these positions? There was going to be a Tasmanian state demographer only a couple of years ago. That seems to be scrapped as well. This is a government that is all over the shop.

Mr Abetz - Like your privatisation policy.

Members interjecting.

Mr WINTER - No mandate for that policy, leader of government business, no mandate for your policy. What Tasmanians need to see is a government that has its act together. This is a total and utter mess that we have seen this week in the parliament, what we have seen in these budgets and what we have seen in this motion today. We have a Tasmanian business community that says it will be hard to ever trust this government again. We have the worst business confidence levels of any state or territory according to Roy Morgan, yet we have a government that wants to pull stunt motions like this.

Our focus at this year's Budget will be firmly on the things that matter to Tasmanians, firmly on the actual budget, firmly on making sure it is sustainable, that the services that Tasmanians desperately need are there and that there is not wasteful spending. Like money for freezers, iPods and whatever else was in that grant scheme; that was completely ridiculous. The fact that they stood there today and tried to defend it, when they are literally freezing the jobs of public servants that are desperately needed for Tasmanians. It is just disgraceful. 

They have lost all touch with reality. It is too much time in the ivory tower. They have lost their grounding in reality. They have lost their connection with Tasmanians and they have lost their way. This is a total and utter mess of government and a total and utter mess of a motion that we will not be supporting.

[7.21 p.m.]
Mr BEHRAKIS (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I had better sum up. The opposition leader was so offended by my efficiency with words and speaking too quickly. We heard about the embarrassment - and what is embarrassing is an opposition claiming to be an alternative government, completely disrespecting the will of the House and once again failing to come up with an alternative plan. We heard comments about the federal election from Mr Willie. I appreciate that Tasmanian Labor might really be hoping that Albo's success will rub off on them. As the Premier said this week, Mr Winter is no Albo.

The opposition routinely moves motions in this place, calling on the government to do one thing or another, tabling papers or committing to a certain action. Predictably, then they come out afterwards, calling on the government after such a motion to respect the will of the House and respect the will of the parliament. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot pull those motions. You cannot call on others to respect the will of the parliament when there is a motion that suits you, but when the parliament expresses their will towards you, say that it is not something that is worth listening to. This is not us calling on you to table an alternative budget. It is the Parliament of Tasmania that has voted on this - 

Mr Willie - It is your friends the Greens. 
DEPUTY SPEAKER - Order. 

Mr BEHRAKIS - and made their will known, and called on you as an opposition to prove that you are an alternative government and put your money where your mouth is. I will commend the comments by Mrs Beswick and also reflect on Mr Bayley's comments because what he said was right. The Greens, whilst they put up an alternative budget, yes, we criticise it and we go through that as well - but we put up our plan and we put it up there so it can be scrutinised and that is how this is supposed to work.

Labor thinks they have found some sort of loophole, that if they do not put up any plans, if they do not put up any costings, then nobody is going to be able to poke any holes in them. They hope that if they can just bluster their way through and put out enough media releases, eventually people will believe the hype. I do not blame them. I really do not, because during the last election, their own election costings document did not last a day before it had to be rewritten, I think it was 11 times.

I understand their hesitation, because if they put out an alternative budget, they will have to rewrite it and redeliver it the next day. We need to be clear: in 11 years of opposition Labor has not been able to produce an alternative budget. They have not been able to produce an alternative plan; not during critical investments; not during economic scare campaigns; not during COVID, when the cost of living got tough for Tasmanians; not even after the House called on them last year to deliver their $2 billion in savings in an alternative budget.

They make all these big claims, we are going to save all this money; where is it going to come from? That is a black box, elect us to government and then find out. I think that the people of Tasmania deserve better than that. We have a group over there that continually tries to tell people that they are the alternative, that people want change, we are that change but they cannot put their money where their mouth is. They cannot say how they will pay for anything. They cannot say what the costings are because they cannot do it.

With the few times they have tried, they get rewritten less than 24 hours later so I do not blame their hesitation on this. I do not blame them. I understand that they do not want to be put up to scrutiny, but if they think that they are an alternative government, that is what they need to be ready for. They need to be ready to allow the people of Tasmania to scrutinise, to allow this place to scrutinise what their proposed plans would be.

Mr Winter - Why don't you complete your own budget?

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr BEHRAKIS - The Leader of the Opposition, the shadow treasurer, have failed and continually fail to deliver any kind of proper alternative. Criticism without solutions is not leadership; it is actually the furthest thing from it. You do not govern by press release; you govern with plans and results. That is what this government is doing and that is what this government continues to do.

We on this side are proud of what this government has achieved and there is more work that needs to be done. We will continue to do that, but at least we are willing to put our money where our mouth is. We are willing to put our plan on the table during an election, transparently, during Budget time and actually put our money where our mouth is, let it up to be scrutinised and put that plan up there. You have been completely unable to show Tasmanians, or demonstrate to Tasmanians, that you have any plan and that is why after 11 years, and we talk about 11 years ago, what a long time ago, we keep talking about the 8-plus per cent unemployment rates and the recessions and the job losses and 'Oh, that was so long ago, why do they keep bringing that up?' 

It was a long time ago. The reason why, is because you continue to try and play the Tasmanian public for fools. You try and win them over with hype and bluster and press releases but without any plan, without putting your money where your mouth is and letting it up for any scrutiny. Shame on you. I would hope that with this motion and, should it pass, you will actually eventually, maybe one day, respect the will of this House.

Motion agreed to.


ADJOURNMENT

[7.27 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Deputy Speaker, I am sure nobody will object if I move-

That the House do now adjourn.

Answer to Question - Macquarie Point Stadium - Public Consultation
Answer to Question - Macquarie Point Stadium - Compensation to Developers

Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Deputy Speaker, if I may quickly respond to a question asked of the Premier by Mr Bayley, I can provide the following update. The flood mapping requested relates to the movement of stormwater and is in addition to the coastal and river inundation information that has already been supplied. It is noted that analysis suggests there are no inundation risks present at the site. A further report is being prepared about flood risk from stormwater for surrounding areas, which was requested [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=6.4_C=0.79]  in a workshop with the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) and was not part of the letter that was issued to request further information.  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=38.0_D=29.1_C=0.83] The advice is that a report is being prepared based on the updated proposed future levels for the site and will be issued tomorrow. 

The requested conservation management plan (CMP) for the Goods Shed would normally be developed as part of the condition of approval. The first part of the conservation management plan setting out the values of the Goods Shed is being prepared. The policies and procedures for its relocation will need to be developed in [Bookmark: Phr4_O=67.9_D=24.0_C=0.70]  consultation with a suitable contractor and Heritage Tasmania. This detailed second stage will outline tested methodologies for the recording, dismantling, storage and re-erection of the Goods Shed. The methodology will be developed in consultation with Heritage Tasmania and a suitably qualified contractor. Only the first stage can be developed at this point in the process. The full [Bookmark: Phr5_O=93.1_D=10.5_C=0.81]  CMP will be finalised as a condition of the approval. The first stage is expected to be finalised by the end of next week, pending confirmation from the heritage consultants. [Bookmark: Phr6_O=104.1_D=15.6_C=0.83]  This information will also be published by the TPC. Otherwise, it will be published by the Macquarie Point Development Corporation (MPDC), as with the previously mentioned report. 
In answer to Mr Garland, I am advised [Bookmark: Phr7_O=121.0_D=29.4_C=0.81]  that costs incurred by Milieu Property is already a matter on the public record. The MPDC has also been working with the leaseholder for the Goods Shed, which will continue as an events space as part of the multi-purpose stadium. The shed remains undeveloped, with the exception of new roofing, which the corporation installed to enable continued use and internal improvements for a section of office space. The shed was leased for a 10-plus-10-year period  [Bookmark: Phr8_O=150.9_D=29.6_C=0.75] to Hobart Brewing Company. Agreement has been reached to surrender the lease. Hobart Brewing Company will continue to operate on site in the immediate term, with their lease at the Red Shed extended until June 2026.

Tasmanian Race Caller Colin McNiff - Redundancy

 [Bookmark: Phr10_O=184.6_D=1.2_C=0.60]  [Bookmark: Phr11_O=187.9_D=24.4_C=0.71] [7.30 p.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - Deputy Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about a great Tasmanian, Colin McNiff, who has been calling the Tasmanian races for more than 35 years. He has been the voice of Tasmanian racing. This year's Hobart Cup was his 35th in a row. Colin has been one of the most unflappable [Bookmark: Phr12_O=212.8_D=3.4_C=0.74] , friendliest, nicest race callers you could ever imagine [Bookmark: Phr13_O=217.8_D=28.6_C=0.78] ; just a wonderful person who has been calling thoroughbred, harness and greyhound racing across Tasmania throughout that time. 

He has been a dedicated servant to Tasmanian racing and he talked about his time in a 35th anniversary piece he did with the Mercury earlier this year. He told the Mercury:

There is no real comparison with TV presenting, where just about everything is scripted or pre-recorded, race calling you get one chance [Bookmark: Phr14_O=246.8_D=26.6_C=0.83]  so you have to make sure you prepare thoroughly.

It's as stressful as you make it, it all comes down to preparation and self-confidence, having self-belief is important and loving what you do, I don't think anyone could call races if they weren't passionate about the craft.

And passionate, Colin McNiff has been. He says it is about the horses. 

The horses are just so magnificent, I love all aspects and I love being involved with the Tasmanian industry. Everyone knows each other and it's a privilege to be part of it. [Bookmark: Phr15_O=274.2_D=3.0_C=0.67] 

I might have summed it up the same way myself.

 [Bookmark: Phr16_O=278.0_D=27.0_C=0.81] Last week when Colin was suddenly and shockingly made redundant by Sky Racing and Tabcorp, I could not believe it. This is someone who has been synonymous, who has been the sound and voice of Tasmanian racing, along with Milton Pettit before him, and during the same time. Anyone across Australia who was a fan of racing and heard Colin's voice would not know that it was a Tasmanian race. This makes Sky Racing's decision to suddenly axe Colin, as well as two other race callers, Brett Davis and Josh Fleming, quite extraordinary and extraordinarily bad.

There is not just the Tasmania racing aspect, but there is the industrial relations aspect. Telling someone with so many years of service to the industry and the organisation on the day to pack up tools and leave, and not even give him a final race call, is disgraceful treatment of a staff member and someone so valued by the industry.

I will echo some of the sentiments from Tasmanian racing identities. Tasracing CEO Andrew Jenkins confirmed the redundancy to the Mercury. He talked about keeping the industry updated and making sure there was a fitting thankyou for Colin. I thank Tasracing for making sure that happens because the employer certainly did not. Brendan Blomeley from the Tasmanian Racing Club said: 

It was an extremely disappointing decision and Colin will be missed by many. He has, in his trademark pleasant, confident, reliable manner, entertained many thousands with his race callings, most notably with 35 Hobart Cups.

Leading north-west thoroughbred trainer Glenn Stevenson was angry and upset about Mr McNiff's treatment. He said: 

I'm shocked. It's terrible. I couldn't believe it. He's had such passion for the industry and his work. He was the voice of Tassie nationally. He should be able to leave on his own terms, and no respect has been shown to him. Times are tough as racing is really struggling in Tasmania and this is just another blow to the industry as it slowly slips further down the slide. 

Tasmanian racing has had a difficult last few years with the huge amount of turmoil that has been going on, caused by some very bad eggs in an otherwise outstanding industry, and it did not need this. It is a shocking decision, shocking treatment of a great Tasmanian, someone who was such a critical component of his industry. Mr McNiff's treatment by Tascorp - not the Tasmanian version, the betting agency - as well as Sky Racing, which it is associated with, has been shocking and they really should reflect on the way they treat their workers.


National Domestic Violence Remembrance Day

[7.35 p.m.]
Ms BADGER (Lyons) - Today, 7 May, marks National Domestic Violence Remembrance Day. Outside Parliament House, earlier this evening, on the lawns in the rain, members of this place joined a candlelight vigil held by Engender Equality to remember those who have lost their lives to gendered violence. It is a time to reflect on how much more we must do - and urgently - to ensure the safety of women and children. 

According to Femicide Watch, 24 women and seven children in Australia have been killed in gendered violence since the start of 2025. Shamefully, Tasmania has the highest number of people facing family, domestic and sexual violence in their own homes with the lowest investment per capita in prevention and support services in the country. 

I am going to read into Hansard a family, domestic and sexual violence statement from a brave victim-survivor who is here with us in the Chamber today:

I'm a survivor of family violence. Before the abuse I was a strong, independent and well-known, respected member of my community. For 30 years I worked to save lives - swim teacher, lifeguard, volunteer, paramedic, first aid trainer. I had dreams of leading Surf Life Saving Tasmania. Then I met a man who dismantled everything I was.

Over four years, I was groomed, isolated, gaslit, beaten, raped and even strangled while eight months pregnant. His abuse escalated when I found out I was pregnant with our son. During our relationship, I witnessed him hurt his other children and our pets. After our son was born, the abuse escalated again. Then he reversed the narrative, smeared my name and discarded us.

In June 2023, the abuser was arrested and charged. A family violence order was granted to protect me but, due to a clerical error, my son's name wasn't included, a three-year old child left exposed. I've done everything that I can to have this corrected. I've spoken to the police services, lawyers. Nothing has changed and so the man who abused us walks free without a monitoring bracelet. We've had to move more than five times. My dogs flinch at passing utes. I vomit from anxiety. I break teeth by grinding them in my sleep. I live in fear that the next time he'll come for my son. 

My son is the invisible victim of this violence. The system has failed him and it continues to. Why am I protected, but not my son? Why is a child in less need of protection? The offender, my son's dad, displayed patterns of harming children, harming pets, harming his ex-wife and myself, an extensive coercive control of the whole family. So, there is undeniable evidence of a risk to my son. Why is he not protected? I am being supported by services such as SASS, family violence counselling, DECYP Tasmania, Engender Equality, BaptistCare, CatholicCare, and so many others. Each of these services echo with the same distressing point: the system is broken.

Even with changes to legislation, I have been told that we must wait for people in these professions to catch up to the changes. How many women and children are put at risk before they catch up? It seems we live in a system where the only way domestic violence is recognised is when something horrific or tragic happens. How many lives, women and children's lives, have to be taken before something is done to deter perpetrator behaviour? Please, I beg you, fix this error. Protect my son. Don't wait until tragedy strikes to act.

How is it that in Tasmania in 2025 this story is all too familiar, and that these distressing circumstances and systemic failures are faced repeatedly by Tasmanian women and children doing all in their power to simply create a safe life? How long must a mother and child live in fear because they are victims of both family violence and of an underfunded, no longer fit-for-purpose system? It is a system that should be protecting them, not increasing fear and prolonging an unsafe living situation. In courts, FVOs can be altered to include the protection of children, but these systems are lengthy, they are unpredictable, and they are too often weaponised.

We should not only see serious action after a victim has lost their voice. If we listen and act now, we can learn and fix systemic failures commonly faced. We should be proactive on systemic and legislative overhaul. There must be appropriate training and accountability for decision-makers. We must be doing all in our power to create a fairer, safer and kinder Tasmania, and indeed Australia, every day.

Members - Hear, hear.

The SPEAKER - Well said, Ms Badger.


Mental Health Services

[7.40 p.m.]
Mr JAENSCH (Braddon - Minister for Mental Health and Wellbeing) - Honourable Speaker, I thank Ms Badger for her contribution and acknowledge the brave survivors who have shared their story in our Chamber tonight and out on the lawns. Thank you.

During Adjournment last night, the member for Bass, Ms Rosol, asked a series of questions of me and my capacity as Minister for Mental Health and Wellbeing. I thank the member for sharing her concerns and I am happy to rise tonight to respond to them.

I am advised that following a period of consultation, the Department of Health introduced several structural changes to its Community Mental Health and Wellbeing and System Management and Reform Division on 6 March 2025. The restructure included combining the Mental Health, Alcohol and Drug Directorate (MHADD), with statewide mental health services, and moving some functions to other parts of the department.

There were no job losses as a result of these changes. I am advised by the Secretary of the Department that these changes were about functional alignments to strengthen governance, accountability and consolidation of resources. All functions of the former MHHAD are still in operation.

The structural change also removes the duplication of like functions being undertaken across different business units, and enables more meaningful engagement with external stakeholders, including Primary Health Tasmania and the Mental Health Council of Tasmania. These structural changes support progression of our government's ongoing commitment to developing and implementing key strategies, including the Tasmanian Suicide Prevention Strategy 2023-2027, the Tasmanian Drug Strategy 2024-2029, the 20-Year Preventive Health Strategy, and to deliver on initiatives and identify policy reform strategies.

These changes are not related to the proposal to move services from Tolosa Street to a government-owned site in Chigwell. Tolosa Street is a 12-bed facility in Glenorchy operated by Statewide Mental Health Services. It provides a combination of residential rehabilitation, community-based respite, and step-up step-down services for adults. It is characterised as a sub-acute or non-acute mental health service.

There is a current proposal to move services delivered at Tolosa Street to a purpose-built facility in Chigwell. This proposal is part of the Tasmanian government's strategy for a best practice approach to building a contemporary integrated model of mental healthcare to ensure that Tasmanians can get more holistic support in the right place at the right time. The proposed approach to move mental health beds to a not-for-profit community services provider, Richmond Futures, will move away from institutional care to a model that provides individualised care, enhancing the consumer's experience. It also provides an opportunity to improve the connection between the sub-acute, residential, rehabilitation, and community-based respite and other services currently provided by Richmond Futures.

I am advised Richmond Futures have a proven track record and deliver residential mental health services funded by the Tasmanian government in the north and north-west of the state, and also deliver a mental health nursing program with registered nurses. Richmond Futures has been delivering specialised community-based mental health services for more than 40 years in Tasmania. The Department of Health commenced a consultation process on 17 April, which ends on 23 May. Engagement has occurred with staff, unions, consumers, families and carers as well as Mental Health Family and Friends and Mental Health Lived Experience Tasmania.

Our government's overarching mental health strategy, Rethink, delivered over the past 10 years, is all about delivering an integrated, contemporary mental health system for Tasmania. A big part of Rethink is to integrate government and community services from hospital to home into one seamless delivery system or mental health sector, centred on individualised care. We are not selling off or privatising services, rather our government has continued to increase the services delivered by our statewide mental health services.

This includes the addition of 12 beds added at the Peacock Centre in 2023 and 6 beds added at the Royal Hobart Hospital short-stay unit from 2021. This is on top of our government's record investment to transform our mental health system through a commitment of over $320 million over the 2024-25 budget and the forward Estimates to progress the mental health infrastructure program.

As I conclude, it is important to acknowledge that any discussion about mental health can bring up issues for some individuals, and I remind those present and anyone listening that if you are struggling, please reach out for assistance through Access Mental Health on 1800 332 388.

The SPEAKER - I will take Mr O'Byrne, who is the only one who knew that he should call my name at the same time as jumping - also, because he has not forgiven me for making him do the count yesterday.


Jack Burley - Parliament Work Experience Studentfrom MacKillop Catholic College

[7.45 p.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - Make sure Hansard got that. I will reference that comment. 

Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight on the Adjournment. One of the pleasures of this job is that we get to host, from time to time, work experience students coming in and experiencing the world that we occasionally live in in this place. These are young students who are keen on civics and politics and the debates that occur in the community. We have been very fortunate to have, over the last couple of days, young Jack Burley from MacKillop Catholic College.

He was with Bec Thomas on Monday in the upper House and I think he is with other members for the rest of the week, but we were very lucky to have him for the last two days in our office. He kept us on our toes. He was very informed; he remembered stuff about some state-based political debates that we had forgotten. A young mind that was fresh, keen and onto it. He is 15 but, let us be clear, nearly 16. Young Jack's mum is a nurse, which has given him an interest in the health system, and they regularly discuss some of the challenges in health, especially when it comes to waiting lists.

He has written a few notes for me to give a speech. This is obviously my speech, and as a politician I take full credit for it, but Jack has done an amazing job in pulling this speech together, so I want to thank him. He raised a number of points about the health system which have formed this speech today.

The length of the waiting list is a major concern for Tasmanian nurses. Our hospital system over the years has let thousands of people fall through the cracks when it comes to their surgery. There are too many cases of people waiting 12 months for surgery when they are told they are on the urgent or semi-urgent list, which is one month to three months. According to the latest Department of Health dashboard, there are 8768 people on the elective surgery waiting list and only 63 per cent are being seen within the recommended time.

The average overdue waiting days are 52 for category one, 172 for category two and 198 for category three. The oral health waiting list is also concerning, with 11,547 people waiting for care. There are also 65,608 patients on the outpatients waiting list. The lives of people waiting too long for surgery are significantly affected. People are suffering because of the failure of the system. 

Multiple reports say Tasmania's health system is one of the worst in the country and in need of reform. There are multiple reports saying [Bookmark: Phr2_O=30.3_D=28.1_C=0.82]  we need to invest more money into the system now. Jack hopes, for the sake of all the people waiting too long for surgery in Tasmania, that we as a parliament can work together to find solutions. 

I thank Jack for his time and his passion for his community. Clearly, he cares. I wish him well for the rest of the school year. I have messaged his mum and we will have Jack back at any time he wants, because he is a good young man [Bookmark: Phr3_O=59.2_D=15.5_C=0.52] , and this speech and the work that he has done for this speech is important. His voice is heard in this place. Thank you, Jack. To his parents; you have parented very well. 


Protecting Tasmania's Forests

[7.48 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) -  [Bookmark: Phr4_O=79.5_D=29.5_C=0.81] Honourable Speaker, this week I had the honour of sponsoring an e-petition on behalf of my constituent Stella Rodriguez on the incredibly important subject of protecting Tasmania's forests. I have had the privilege of meeting with countless members of my electorate who are appalled at this government's plan to open 40,000 hectares of native forest to logging. People who have never been involved in an environmental campaign in their life are attending public meetings and forest open days and signing petitions to ensure these forests are protected [Bookmark: Phr5_O=109.1_D=30.0_C=0.82]  from destructive forestry practices. 

Protecting forest is extremely important to protect biodiversity, maintain ecological function and sequester carbon, but protecting forests is also critically important to human health and wellbeing. What this government has never been able to understand is that forests have far more value to the community intact and standing than they could ever have as wood chips. I know this from personal experience with some of the children who I have cared for, who have asked to g [Bookmark: Phr6_O=139.2_D=7.1_C=0.75] o out for a walk in Notley Fern Gorge because they needed it to be able to calm down. That is the power of forests.

 [Bookmark: Phr7_O=146.6_D=16.3_C=0.89] As well as improving our overall wellbeing, students have shown that forest therapy can positively influence health indicators for people with anxiety, depression, stress and schizophrenia, and wilderness therapy and forest bathing is beneficial for children who have experienced trauma.

 [Bookmark: Phr8_O=164.1_D=29.6_C=0.83] I saw the beneficial effects of nature connection and forest bathing firsthand when I ran my counselling practice. I used to run a regular walk called a 'wander' where we would go for a mindful walk in nature. I know that there were people who experienced the benefits of that and I definitely experienced the benefits of those walks myself when I led them. 

Many of us have lived experience of the importance of nature for our mental health. We only need to look back on the COVID-19 pandemic [Bookmark: Phr9_O=193.9_D=29.8_C=0.84]  and the crucial role that public parks, walking tracks and green spaces played in maintaining the mental health of people in lockdown. If being in forests improves our mental health, it is probably not surprising to hear that destroying forests decreases it. A study in the Journal of Climate Change and Health found that countries with a greater area covered by forests also had lower rates of mental health and substance abuse disorders, and that this relationship was maintained even when controlling [Bookmark: Phr10_O=224.0_D=25.2_C=0.83]  for factors such as poverty, peace and urbanisation.

In a climate-change-biodiversity crisis, conserving our forests is one of the most important actions we can take to try to mitigate climate breakdown. Institutions such as the World Health Organisation, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the World Psychiatric Association have identified that climate change is increasingly having stronger and longer lasting [Bookmark: Phr11_O=250.1_D=3.1_C=0.78]  impacts on people's mental health and psychosocial wellbeing.

 [Bookmark: Phr12_O=253.9_D=29.6_C=0.88] Deforestation, land use change, biodiversity loss, extinctions, ocean pollution, overfishing and repeated exposure to climate-related disasters can increase stress, worsen existing mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, substance abuse and suicidal behaviour, strain social relationships and cause people to feel helplessness, fear and grief. The effect of the climate crisis on mental health has led to the creation of a suite of new terminology [Bookmark: Phr13_O=283.6_D=21.1_C=0.85]  to describe a particular type of anxiety that is being overwhelmingly experienced by young people: climate change anxiety, solastalgia, eco anxiety, environmental distress, ecological grief and climate-related psychological distress. There is a way to combat climate change anxiety: participating in positive climate action can increase wellbeing by providing people, particularly young people, with opportunities to actively engage with solutions and increase their feelings of individual power and capacity to change the situation. 

For the communities across Tasmania that may be feeling disempowered and defeated by the latest Liberal assault on our precious forests, the Greens hear you and we are here to say you have the power. You can join one of the many community groups that are organising across the state in opposition to the Liberals' plan: the Wilderness Society, Protect Our North West Forests, the Mount Arthur Community Protection Group and Protect the Panama to name but a few. You can tell this parliament directly that you do not support the logging of 40,000 hectares of future reserve forest by signing the petition currently available on the Parliament of Tasmania's website. It is my great honour to sponsor it.


National Domestic Violence Remembrance Day

[7.53 p.m.]
Ms BUTLER (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, today is National Domestic Violence Remembrance Day. The day serves as a solemn occasion to honour and remember those who have lost their lives to domestic and family violence across Australia. Tonight, Tasmanian communities have come together to participate in candlelight vigils as part of this national remembrance. We were honoured to attend the vigil outside of parliament tonight that was hosted by the Southern Domestic Violence Coordinating Committee. There were simultaneous candlelight vigils which were out in Launceston hosted by the Northern Domestic Violence Coordinating Committee and in Ulverstone, hosted by the Northern Domestic Violence Coordinating Committee there.

Over the last three years, there has been a nearly 30 per cent increase in the number of women killed in domestic and family-violence-related homicides. On average, a woman in Australia dies every seven days from domestic and family violence. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women face further, disproportionate impacts as they are eight times more likely to be victims of homicide. This is highlighted in the Missing and Murdered First Nations Women and Children's Report. 

Domestic, family and sexual violence remain a national crisis in Australia, and yet these forms of violence are preventable. Taking measures to prevent violence, responding to violence, supporting victim-survivors in their recovery and holding perpetrators accountable are all critical steps in ending the crisis.

According to the Australian femicide watch, 103 women were killed in Australia in 2024 and as of April 2025, there have been 24 women killed in Australia. In Tasmania, the number of sexual assaults recorded has increased by 22 per cent, that is 132 offences, from 608 in 2022-23, to 740 in 2023-24. This followed a 1 per cent reduction in the previous year. The 2022-23 results were above the previous five-year average. Sexual assaults reported in 2023-24 occurred most commonly at residential locations (74 per cent), 98 per cent of sexual assaults were committed without a weapon, and females accounted for 87 per cent of sexual assault victims. The sexual assault clearance rate reduced from 88 per cent in 2022 to 85 per cent in 2023-24. Those statistics are horrendous enough. 

There is a poem which I would like to read into the record. It was written by a victim-survivor named Nikki: 

If I could tell myself,

That the romance, the joy,

That intoxicating feeling,

It wasn’t love.
It would be short lived.
It was a dupe,
A hoax,
A tragically well known pattern and ploy.

That the dreams and hopes we had were mine and mine alone.

That he never wanted to live them with me.
That he would criticise, accuse, threaten, confuse and destroy me,
Until I doubted every piece of my now dusty mind, body and soul.


That this so-called love

would become fear.

Fear of what wrong I would do that day,
Fear of what he would seek to find
And manipulate.

Fear of simply being me

And the consequences.

That through fear,

I would lose myself.

I would lose confidence.
I would lose friends and independence.
I would lose rational thought

That this is exactly where he wanted me

So confused I would romanticise the love we once had

SO desperate to get it back I would cling

Onto any ounce of conniving kindness.

So trapped and hopeless that saying in fear was better than attempting escape.

If I could tell myself,

That this was not love,

That this was not my fault,
That there was a way out, I would.

And I would wrap my arms around the scared shell of a woman and hold her.
I would hold her and hold her some more,

Until she felt the warmth of my heart and the safety of my embrace

Until she remembered who she was

And believed she could be again

Thank you.


Rural Youth Tasmania

[7.58 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Deputy Premier) - Honourable Speaker, tonight I would like to pay a tribute to Rural Youth Tasmania for the fantastic Agfest event that was held last weekend and to share a few remarks on that. 

Before doing so, just to say the incredible disappointment earlier today in a debate with respect to remarks by members of the Greens with respect to public servants. I draw that to the attention of the relevant members and others. Public servants have a role to play -

Mr Bayley - What did we say? What did we say about public servants?

The SPEAKER - The interjections do not help.

Mr BARNETT - I am just making the point and I ask you to think about it and -

Mr Bayley - We talked about the minister, Treasurer. Can you clarify what public servants?

The SPEAKER - You can take a point of order, Mr Bayley, if you have been misrepresented.

Mr Bayley - I am not offended. He is just wrong.

Mr BARNETT - I am making a point. You can look at the Hansard yourself and you will see the names of the public servants that you have -

Mr Bayley - You are the ones who are tearing down the Planning Commission.

The SPEAKER - Mr Bayley, you are actually still on a warning.

Mr Bayley - Do I have to put up with this, Speaker?

Mr BARNETT - I am trying to make the short point, but an important one. I believe that the besmirching of public servants in any way, shape or form is not appropriate in this place, so I wanted to make that point and I draw that to your attention in the Hansard -

Members interjecting.
Dr Woodruff - Provide an example. Come on. What a baseless claim.

Mr Bayley - What is your example, Treasurer?

The SPEAKER - Mr Bayley, if you feel you have been misrepresented, you may ask him to withdraw under Standing Orders.

Mr BARNETT - Thank you. With respect to -

Mr BAYLEY - Point of order, honourable Speaker. I do feel as if I am misrepresented. We made the case against the minister and his use of so-called 'legal advice' to tear down the Tasmanian Planning Commission. I ask him to withdraw that. We did not - 

The SPEAKER - That is not a point for you to make an argument. You have two options in front of you: one is that you are offended and I can ask him to withdraw; the second is that whenever you seek the call next, that you can follow through with your claim to be misrepresented, which I accept you have made. I will give you the call next.

Mr BAYLEY - I accept that. I am not offended, but he is just plain wrong.

The SPEAKER - I will give you the call next if you wish to claim you have been misrepresented. 

Mr BARNETT - My time is disappearing fast. 

The SPEAKER - Deputy Premier, do not be outraged. You do this to other people as well. Standing Orders apply equally.

Mr BARNETT - In the few moments I have left -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - You have three minutes left, if that makes it easier.

Mr BARNETT - I want to pay tribute to Rural Youth Tasmania for the fantastic Agfest event that was held last week. It was great to be there and to say, firstly, congratulations to Amber Bramich, the president, and their executive committee and all of the volunteers. I met many of them and I know that there were more than a hundred, and they just did a professional, comprehensive, fantastic effort to make it such a success.

I was there on the Thursday evening and I was advised that they did get record crowds on the Thursday, I think it was over 14,000, and then Friday and Saturday, I was on there all day Friday and I understand more than 50,000 over the three days. It is a fantastic event, a great celebration of the beginning and the opening and the official opening there. My colleague and dear friend, Jane Howlett, Minister for Primary Industries and Water, did a great job in kicking it off with Amber Bramich and many, many others. I just wanted to also pay tribute to not just those who attended and enjoyed it so much, but also the exhibitors. It was really great to catch up with the TasFarmers and DairyTas civil contractors, the primary employers, Rural Business Tasmania, and there were so many others.

I enjoyed a great egg and bacon roll at my old school, the Hagley Farm School. They did a great job. Likewise, the Deloraine High School did a great job as well and I enjoyed a bit of tucker there as well. It is really great to showcase agriculture in Tasmania. I pay a particular tribute to the Tasmanian Forest and Forest Products Network. Dr Julianne O'Reilly-Wapstra hosted us for a morning tea with many other forest and timber industry representatives. It was a fantastic get-together. As a government we support our sustainable forest industry in the thousands of jobs in it, and will continue to do so. A particular highlight for me for the day was catching up with Private Forest Tasmania and Dr Elizabeth Pietrzykowski and her team, who are doing a fantastic job, and it was really good to see them as well. 

All in all, it was a brilliant effort. Rural Youth Tasmania, take a bow. They deserve a fantastic tribute.


Gaza - Humanitarian Crisis

[8.03 p.m.]
Mr GARLAND (Braddon) - Honourable speaker, one of the greatest joys in life is having children. One of the simple pleasures I get is the sound of children laughing. Unfortunately, what we have witnessed in the last two years, every time I have turned the TV on and witnessed what is going on in Gaza - that is my black dog. I cannot escape what is going on there. It is affecting me. I look at my kids and I imagine what all those parents must be going through there. It is abhorrent.

It was funny, I was walking home last night thinking I had done a good job in my Adjournment speech about calamari, feeling how done-over we are, and then I got sent something in a text message. This was written by Aya Al-Hattab. She is a writer in Gaza. It is titled 'Israel is starving us in Gaza. This is what it feels like':

It has been more than 30 hours since I last ate. At times, I go as long as two days without food. For most people around the world, the word hunger is a fleeting feeling, easily fixed with a trip to the kitchen or a nearby store. Saying "I'm hungry" is routine, almost meaningless but imagine if every time you felt hungry, there was nothing to eat - no food, no relief, just emptiness. This has been my daily reality in the Gaza Strip for over a month.

Since the beginning of the war, the Israeli occupation has controlled the quantity and type of food allowed into Gaza. When a ceasefire was agreed, I hoped that everything I had endured was behind me. I held on to the hope of a better life, convinced that hunger would become something in my past but just as I began to regain my health, the bombing and destruction returned - and with them, the starvation.

For nearly two months, food and medicine has been prevented from entering Gaza. Each morning, I wake up hoping to have breakfast, only to find nothing. Then in the afternoon, I go shopping with my mother, hoping we'll find something to cook - but vegetables have nearly vanished from the markets, and even bread is becoming scarce. Shelves stand empty. At this rate, it's only a matter of time before there's nothing left to eat and even then, what does a small meal every two or three days really mean in the face of starvation?

Hunger was never part of our lives before. We used to cook the most delicious meals, order our favourite foods, and enjoy them without a second thought. Now, we remember those days not just as part of the past, but like they belonged to another world entirely - a world that was safer, kinder, and so much more beautiful.

The blockade has forced me - and so many others - into collective punishment, facing hunger and hardship for something we had no part in. I'm just a young woman who loves life in all its beautiful forms, yet I'm made to suffer and watch my people suffer as a form of pressure to return the hostages. How is that fair? It's not. It's deeply unjust. As a young woman who should be in full physical and mental health, I feel my body growing weaker, more fragile with each passing moment.

I've read on news sites that poverty in Gaza has reached unprecedented levels but this is not poverty, it is famine. The Israeli occupation is directly responsible for creating this humanitarian catastrophe. Children in the Gaza Strip have begun to die of hunger. Unlike adults, they cannot endure such suffering. I think of them, imagining the food they long for but can't have - and the thought is heartbreaking.

Fear of death casts a long shadow over life in a place under occupation. Everyone who has an illness or injury can no longer access the medicine they need. In this vast prison that is Gaza, death comes in many forms: by sniper fire, by bombing, by starvation, by lack of medical care, or even from great fear. We hear that Israel has plans to completely capture Gaza and remain here, displacing so many of us. We are dying, we are starving. Are we soon to be homeless, stateless?

It feels as though the Gaza Strip is no longer part of this world, as if we're living in some distant, forgotten galaxy. Our lives are marked by suffering and strangeness, while the rest of the world carries on as if our reality doesn't exist.

I never truly understood the feeling of hunger - its depth, its cruelty, its ugliness - until I experienced it fully, in every painful detail.

I condemn what is going on in Gaza and I wish the whole world would stand up and object to this brutality. It is unjust.


Tasmanian Public Servants - Response to Treasurer's Comments

 [Bookmark: Phr2_O=18.8_D=2.0_C=0.34] [8.07 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker,  [Bookmark: Phr3_O=23.0_D=12.6_C=0.76] I was not going to get to my feet tonight, but after that pathetic effort from the Deputy Premier I must, because we did not besmirch the reputation of any public servants [Bookmark: Phr4_O=36.3_D=29.7_C=0.80]  in our debate today about referring the leader of government business to - you are not going to stay to listen to this, Treasurer? You throw accusations around, now I am on my feet and you are going to walk out. You are the ones who are tearing down the reputation of the Tasmanian Planning Commission. Out he goes. He does not want to listen to this, for the record. 

The Tasmanian government is the one who is besmirching the record of good people who are acting in the interests of Tasmania - the Tasmanian Planning Commission and the panel [Bookmark: Phr5_O=66.3_D=29.9_C=0.83]  - based on utterly flimsy advice that the proponent of the stadium and the government's own agents edited - actually sent track changes documents to edit. The government has been waving that around and using that as a pretence to walk away from that process and to bring forward special legislation. 

The Premier even took the remarkable step of saying that he believed that they went into the Tasmanian Planning Commission panel - which he appointed [Bookmark: Phr6_O=96.3_D=29.8_C=0.67] ; it was his order that set up this process - have gone into this assessment process with a preconceived view on the project. It is utterly shameful that the government is tearing down independent experts in this way - an ex-deputy solicitor-general no less, an ex-treasury boss, and other experts in administration and planning. 

We mentioned the names of senior public servants, including Kathrine Morgan-Wicks and including the board of the Macquarie [Bookmark: Phr7_O=126.3_D=29.9_C=0.80]  Point Development Corporation, but it was in the context of them editing a letter from a law firm and sending back tracked changes, as is their right. We made that point. They are the proponents of the stadium and it is completely their right to edit a representation to ensure that it reflects their view and to send it into the assessment process that is assessing their development. 

We do not make any judgment on them in terms of [Bookmark: Phr8_O=156.5_D=15.6_C=0.77]  that action; it is what you would expect. It is the government and the leader of government business that we condemn for waving around that representation, pretending it is some kind of legal advice that says that the planning commission's report [Bookmark: Phr9_O=173.8_D=5.0_C=0.56]  cannot be relied on, and using that as an utterly flimsy justification f [Bookmark: Phr10_O=180.8_D=29.6_C=0.72] or attacking the credibility of that panel and walking away from that process. 

It is on the government's head that they are going to do this. What we got out of today's debate was a spectacular own goal from the leader of government business. He admitted that the government basis for bypassing the Tasmanian Planning Commission's process and passing special legislation was not based on impartial legal advice, as [Bookmark: Phr11_O=210.9_D=7.3_C=0.69]  they had been saying. They had been saying that they had this legal advice that there is apprehended bias in the planning commission's report [Bookmark: Phr12_O=218.6_D=10.5_C=0.83]  and therefore it cannot be relied on. He acknowledged today that it was not advice and it was not impartial. It was acknowledged that it was [Bookmark: Phr13_O=231.0_D=20.4_C=0.71]  cooked up, or at least worked up with the assistance of the proponent.

What we had there from the Treasurer and the Deputy Premier was a spectacular case of the pot calling the kettle black. While he accuses and points to we Greens for besmirching the reputation of public servants [Bookmark: Phr14_O=251.9_D=29.4_C=0.87] , he and his government and the leader of government business and all the way up to the Premier are using this flimsy legal argument to tear down the credibility of the planning commission and tear down the credibility of the panel that they appointed. This is because they know that they are doing their job: they are looking at the stadium closely, they are assessing all of the issues, they are flagging the issues that need to be dealt with, and it is very clear that if they were allowed to do their job all the way through to conclusio [Bookmark: Phr15_O=281.9_D=16.0_C=0.76] n, the stadium would not pass - the stadium would be recommended for refusal. It is utterly clear.

The supreme irony here is that the place to prosecute the arguments that the proponent is making in its representation [Bookmark: Phr16_O=298.1_D=6.7_C=0.79]  are public hearings. The POSS process provides for public hearings, where if you have a criticism about something that the Planning Commission has done, if you do not think their assessment or the scope of their assessment is correct, you take that case into the public hearings. You bring your lawyers in with you and they represent you there. For the Deputy Premier to be attacking us for besmirching public servants is absolutely hypocritical. That is what his government is doing all the way to the top, to the Premier.


Andrew Irving - Medical Cannabis

[8.13 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, before I start, I acknowledge the heartfelt Adjournment speech from Mr Garland calling out the genocide that is happening in the Gaza Strip right now.

I rise this evening to place on record the struggle and what seemed relentless pursuit of a 74-year-old man who was only trying to do the right thing to help others in pain and suffering. I speak of Mr Andrew Irving, who would be known to many in this place. Former member for Lyons - now federal member for Lyons - Ms White certainly advocated on Mr Irving's behalf.

I call Andrew Irving a friend. Andrew has campaigned for access to medical cannabis and wants to see cannabis legalised. Andrew's wife Marilyn was his world. Unfortunately, Marilyn became extremely unwell. Her neurological condition was cruel. It made muscles spasm and pain unbearable. Andrew made a medical cannabis tincture or topical cream which gave significant pain relief when other conventional mainstream treatments failed.

Andrew had grown cannabis at home to treat his beloved wife Marilyn's pain and muscle spasms, and she encouraged Andrew to continue with this work once she was gone. That was Marilyn's legacy. Andrew, as a long-term advocate for the benefits of medical cannabis, channelled his energy and grief, which was significant, into helping others.

Unfortunately, Andrew's kindness was taken advantage of. I will not go into the details of how he was set up and turned in to the police, but this in itself was a cruel blow. The charges were severe. The court process was diabolical. He suffered through the process, the many adjournments of his case, the worry of his predicament. Recently we heard the welcome news that Andrew Irving will not face a custodial sentence as his court case finally concluded after three years.

An article by Sue Bailey in the Sunday Tasmanian on 6 April said Andrew's life has been left in tatters. For three years he has suffered the fate of the law system, of adjourned hearings, of the angst that someone going through this has been, of significant legal costs awarded against him. 

From the same article: Acting Justice Shane Marshall described Andrew's actions as having had 'very commendable noble aspects' and spoke of the suffering Andrew went through, including three mini strokes and serious mental health challenges as the case drew on.
Andrew has been a tireless campaigner for extending access to medical cannabis for those who need it, having seen the effectiveness in treating Marilyn's condition. He wants to see cannabis legalised. The cruel irony is that if it had been at the time of his arrest, then it would be unlikely that he would have been dragged through the mire.

Despite the mercy shown in imposing a non-custodial sentence, the case continues to have a devastating impact on Andrew's life. Tasmania Police seized his savings in cash when he was arrested and this had to be forfeited. He has been fined over $40,000 despite the court acknowledging that his primary motivation in offending was helping others. Someone of his age who has done no harm and created no victim does not deserve to be fined such an excessive amount for the crime of caring for others. There is a GoFundMe campaign to help Andrew with his legal costs. It is https://www.gofundme.com/f/save-a-pensioner-from-debt

Medical cannabis is legal across many parts of the world. In the ACT, Andrew would have been able to legally grow his own plants to manage Marilyn's condition. It helps thousands of people in Tasmania to treat conditions like serious chronic pain from which they can find no other relief. It is long past time we fixed our outdated Tasmanian laws when it comes to drugs. It is time to treat the use of drugs as a health issue rather than a criminal issue. 

If you can, please go to Andrew's GoFundMe campaign and help him in his predicament. I am very proud to call Andrew a friend.

The House adjourned at 8.18 p.m.

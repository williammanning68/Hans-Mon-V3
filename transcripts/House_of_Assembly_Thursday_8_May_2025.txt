The Speaker, Ms O'Byrne, took the Chair at 10.00 a.m., acknowledged the Traditional People, and read Prayers.


LEAVE OF ABSENCE

Member for Clark - Minister Ogilvie

Mr ROCKLIFF (Braddon - Premier) - I advise the House that minister Ogilvie will be absent from the House today due to illness. I will be taking questions in respect to all of her portfolios, being Innovation, Science and the Digital Economy, Corrections and Rehabilitation, the Environment, and the Arts and Heritage. 


QUESTIONS

Macquarie Point Stadium - Cost

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF 

[10.02 a.m.]
Labor supports the stadium because it will create jobs and deliver the AFL and AFLW teams that our state deserves, but we do not support attempts to mislead Tasmanians about the promises that your government has made. Minister Abetz went on radio this morning and said it was always clear from your announcement in February last year that there would be additional borrowings on top of the $375 million 'and not one red cent more.' This is an insult to Tasmanians. Frankly, no one will believe his claim.

I have a copy of your media release here. It does not mention additional borrowings, not once. Instead, it says:

… a re-elected majority Rockliff Liberal Government will cap Tasmanian Government capital expenditure on the Macquarie Point Stadium at the currently budgeted $375 million - and not one red cent more. 

Can you point to a single occasion where you said '$375 million capital costs plus borrowings' as part of that election campaign, or did minister Abetz mislead Tasmanians this morning?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. It has been very clear when it comes to the AFL club funding agreement and where it mentions borrowings. In the Stadium Business Case 2023, page 9:

Ms Brown - No, where did you say it?

The SPEAKER - Member for Franklin.

Mr ROCKLIFF - 

The Tasmanian Government has announced a commitment of $375 million (in addition to existing funding for works at Macquarie Point and the value of the land). The AFL will contribute $15 million towards construction costs.

A further $85 million is proposed to be funded through borrowings against land sale or lease for commercial uses.

It has always been public knowledge.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left will cease interjecting so I can hear the supplementary question.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - That must be the shortest answer the Premier has ever given. A supplementary question going to the question: can the Premier advise the House where he personally stated during the election campaign or otherwise that there will be '$375 million of capital costs plus borrowings.' When did you say it?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I will allow the question, although I do believe the Premier is probably going to give the same answer.

Mr Willie - Twisting yourself in knots.

Mr Winter - He is like a child.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I have been very clear about the $375 million capital.

Ms BROWN - When did you say it then? 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The business case mentions borrowings. The member can use the terminology 'twist and turn' or whatever you used, but the only person -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I have allowed the supplementary. Let us hear the answer in silence.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The only person twisting and turning is the Leader of the Opposition himself, who does not even know where he was born.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - How do I know that?

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Premier, I do have a point of order. I will take the point of order and we will hear it in silence.

Ms BROWN - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. He is going absolutely nowhere near the question of where -

The SPEAKER - You do not need to make the argument. Standing Order 45, relevance did apply. The Premier has addressed the question. He can choose to resume his seat if he would like.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It is an important matter of integrity and -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Cost

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.05 a.m.]
This is an important matter of integrity, and so my question is again to the Premier. I have a transcript of your press conference from 15 February last year. You told Tasmanians:

What is a clear commitment is that the $375 million will be invested and not one cent more. This is our commitment; there will be no more spent or invested in the stadium, the Macquarie Point precinct stadium, than $375 million. That's our commitment. 

That is in black and white. Why are you trying to take Tasmanians for fools?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. The important matter is the $375 million, as committed to, but the business case clearly outlined the fact of borrowings, as did the budget last year.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr ROCKLIFF - You can come in here all you like, Mr Winter, when it comes to changing positions -

Mr Winter - No one believes you.
Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left, broadly.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The member mentioned misleading the public, but I also have the information when it comes to where you were born - 

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - where two days before you were elected as Leader of the Labor Party, you were born in Hobart, and two days after, on Wikipedia, you somehow changed your birth to Queenstown.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - When you talk about integrity, you have none. You have some questions to answer as well when it comes to these matters. I have been clear when it comes to the stadium investment, about $375 million capital -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order so we can hear the answer.

Mr ROCKLIFF - and all the information in the business case.

Members interjecting.

Dr BROAD - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. Instead of this Trump birther nonsense, can the Premier please address himself to the question, which is very serious? People want answers to this.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - If I can say, the Premier had started turning his language to the question and I encourage him to continue doing so. The House can just stop yelling.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We have been clear and upfront about our investments. The budget borrowings last year - the business case mentions borrowings and we are talking about a $375 million -

Ms BROWN - When did you say it to the media? The people of Tasmania?

The SPEAKER - Member for Franklin.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - Can I have a supplementary question?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - Coming from the answer that the Premier gave - he said he had been very clear about the amount. Can the Premier name one time during last year's election campaign where he said $375 million plus borrowings?

The SPEAKER - The original question was are you taking Tasmanians for fools, but the Premier did address the issue of the funding, so I will ask him to come to the question again. 

Mr Farrell - You can just say no.

The SPEAKER - And you can think about leaving the Chamber, member for Lyons.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The $375 million capital cost was very clearly outlined in our policy, but also in the context of the reports and the AFL agreement, which mentions borrowings, it is pretty clear.

Members interjecting.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Legislative Council Support

Mr BAYLEY question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF 

[10.09 a.m.]
You have spent the last few weeks running a Paul Lennon impersonation and now you are doing your best Tony Soprano. Mafia-style standover tactics would have been well beneath the old Jeremy Rockliff, but since you have sold out to the AFL, you have completely changed. You have lost your integrity and now you are desperately trying to browbeat the Legislative Council into doing your bidding. It is fair to say it has gone down like a lead balloon. Last night, the member for Murchison described your approach as 'bordering on the unlawful', 'insulting', and said, 'Threats, intimidation and coercion are unacceptable in any setting.' We could not agree more.

Will you apologise to the Legislative Council for your actions yesterday? Will you stop the bullying and will you show some respect to the upper House by withdrawing your absurd ultimatum?

The SPEAKER - I will call the Premier to the question. I will remind members that they are obliged not to reflect upon the other place while they are in this House.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. Yesterday, I clearly outlined, as I have always done, with respect to this project, that if there is no stadium, there is no team. That has been very clear. We have very strict timelines when it comes to the construction of the stadium, which is important -

Mr Bayley - You established a process to assess it.

The SPEAKER - Deputy Leader of the Greens, you had your question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - By the very nature of the enabling legislation, Mr Bayley, we have to get on with the job. I know it is challenging for individual members of parliament. This is a challenging debate, but we all have one vote in this place and the other place. We will avail all the information and the information we are still gaining from the public submissions will inform the legislation as well.

I am absolutely committed to this project for all the reasons that I have outlined. I say very clearly that I expect to come into Question Time and have robust debate, and for me to be accused of all sorts of things in the discourse of the discussion and the debate.

To your question, which is a very serious matter, I will defend the integrity of the head of our State Service.

Mr Bayley - But not the planning commission.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - Members of the Greens. Members on my right.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I will bet my life on the integrity of the head of the State Service. 

Members interjecting.

Mr Bayley - No one has questioned the integrity of the head of the State Service. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - The fact that you came in here besmirching hardworking public servants - yes you did.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The member for Clark will stop interjecting. The member for Franklin will also stop interjecting. The Premier will direct his answers through the chair to avoid the interjections.

Mr ROCKLIFF - It is the Greens who should apologise for the personal attacks.

Mr Winter - You are going to do the personal attack routine? You hypocrite.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We have hardworking public servants informing members of parliament about the enabling legislation process. Frankly, I find it despicable that you would use this debate to besmirch the integrity of our hardworking public servants. I stand by my comments in terms of the head of the State Service, as I have just mentioned.

We can have all the discussion, all the debate that you like. I believe in this project and I am losing skin on it. I recognise that.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Mr BAYLEY - May I have a supplementary question?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr BAYLEY - The Premier referenced the public submission process, which is part of the POSS process, which is what he is attempting to kill off. Why is he attempting to kill it off? Why does he not let the POSS process run through to its conclusion, irrespective of the outcome of the special legislation? 

The SPEAKER - I am sorry, I did take note of the Premier's answer. I do not see that arising from his answer, but you have other opportunities to ask questions.


Youth Crime - Multi-Systemic Therapy Program

Mr O'BYRNE question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.13 a.m.]
Earlier this week I asked you a question regarding the important investment in programs that divert young people away from crime and antisocial behaviour. In your response, you acknowledged how important that investment is. It has now been reported that the Multi-Systemic Therapy Program, launched in 2022, is no longer operating in the north and north-west.

The program was aimed at youth crime prevention by offering to support young people with serious or escalating antisocial and problematic behaviour. This is the type of behaviour that has spilled out into our streets in a few recent highly publicised events. The government has been happy to divert police resources to tackle the issue but, with respect, that approach is the proverbial ambulance at the bottom of the cliff. It is of great concern to members of the community that evidence-based, community-based supports that have a positive impact in this area are not being supported. How can this situation, particularly given the challenges we are facing, be defendable?

ANSWER 

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question. I concur with the member's sentiment about the importance of these services, very clearly, which is why we will support the service you mentioned - the Multi-Systemic Therapy Program, otherwise known as MST, which was launched in 2022 and has since been reviewed. I am advised that following the review and the commission of inquiry recommendations, the Department of Health is currently working on a new, contemporary, evidence-informed youth forensic mental health service. 

I want to be very clear: we will not be reducing services. In fact, with the learnings and the need for further investment we will actually be increasing and improving services. That includes developing a comprehensive youth forensic model of care, as we have spoken about in this Chamber this week, one that is flexible and responsive to young people engaged with the youth justice system. 

These improvements will be supported by a $9.8 million investment over four years, committed in the 2024-25 state budget, to further develop the Child and Adolescent Youth Forensic Mental Health services aligned with the COI recommendations. I am advised that MST has been delivered to young people in all regions at varying levels of capacity since 2022.

Since launching in 2022, there are 62 young people who were discharged from the program with an average intervention length of 131 days. Not unsurprisingly, I am also advised the program was significantly impacted by workforce recruitment and retention challenges experienced nationwide with respect to these matters. Of course, we want to do better for our young people and our community, and we will be delivering a new model of care that is indeed flexible and responsive. 

Thank you for the question. I concur with you, but can I say very clearly that we will be improving services, most certainly not cutting these services back, as I said before. We will not be reducing services, to use that terminology. No doubt you will keep me accountable for what I have just said and my belief in the program. I know and I understand, like you do, its value. 


Macquarie Point Stadium - Cost

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.17. a.m.]
You are trying to claim that, because you released a business case which included borrowings against land sales before you made the cost cap commitment, somehow Tasmanians were supposed to know that your subsequent promise to cap the total cost also included the borrowings. It is utter nonsense. When making the announcement you also said:

What we've said is that our funding, our investment of $375 million, will be invested - not a cent more. Of course, the rest will come from the private sector in a true partnership to realize that vision.

You were explicit: $375 million, not a red cent more, with the rest to come from the private sector if required. Why are you trying to pretend otherwise?

ANSWER

I have been very clear. We have been crystal clear that the Macquarie Point Development Corporation will need to take on borrowings. The initial business case, which was always there - you should have read it, you were the shadow treasurer at the time. 

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The AFL agreement and -

The SPEAKER - It is not a conversation, it is Question Time. The Premier will direct answers through the Chair.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Page 19 of last year's budget -

Ms Brown - What did you actually say to people?

The SPEAKER - I just said it is not a conversation, Ms Brown.

Mr ROCKLIFF - where it talks about expenditure risks with the Macquarie Point urban renewal project:

Additional expenditure outside of the forward Estimates is anticipated to be met through short-term borrowings by the Macquarie Point Development Corporation. 

That is what the project is about. You create an enabling project and then there is interest in the private sector to support when they invest, and you pay down that debt after that. It is very clear when it comes to those matters. It is very strategic. You need the enabler first. You need the 23,000 seat stadium. You need the 1500 seat convention centre to - 

Ms Finlay - You need to be honest with Tasmanians first.

The SPEAKER - You need to remember the Standing Orders, actually.

Mr ROCKLIFF - encourage investment in the visitor economy. Every single year in the last 12 months, for example, there has consistently been $3.5 billion of injection into the visitor economy from people coming to Tasmania. We need to build on that. I heard a figure the other day that one in six Tasmanians are employed in the tourism and hospitality sector. This is an investment in the future growth of that sector.
———————————————————
Recognition of Visitors

The SPEAKER - Before I give the call to you, I will recognise in the Gallery some students who have travelled a very long way to be here. They look tired, not because you are not all fascinating, but because they have all travelled down from Forest Primary School, which is up in the far north-west, so thank you very much for joining us. We hope to keep you entertained - but if I can just say to members, not that entertained. Thank you very much, guys.

Members - Hear, hear.

Macquarie Point Stadium - AFL Deal Renegotiation

Ms JOHNSTON question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.21 a.m.]
You are bullying and threatening Tasmanians with losing their teams, rather than negotiating your dud stadium deal: the deal you did on your own without even consulting your Cabinet or your Treasury. You will not let the expert TPC panel do its work. The ultimatum you issued yesterday has been likened to blackmail and is potentially unlawful, according to one upper House member.

You are going to extremes trying desperately to get your stadium approved. Please stop and think about how divisive and deeply disrespectful your approach is to the parliament and the people of Tasmania. It does not have to be this way. Are there any circumstances under which you would renegotiate the AFL stadium deal? What is your line in the sand?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her questions, and I welcome the students from the far north-west, Forest. It is wonderful to have you here as well.

I have made it very clear. When those opposite were opposed to the stadium and talking about floating stadiums, they then got embarrassed about walking into football clubs and meeting with volunteers and parents and kids, and so they crab-walked their way to no position on the stadium. Then after the election they had a better position on the stadium, and then an unconditional position on the stadium and then, of course, other matters.

Members interjecting.

Mr Willie - I never said those words.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left, the question was from Ms Johnston.

Ms Butler - Answer the question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I have been very clear about this: no stadium and no team. We have worked hard for our own team because of the enormous opportunity it is for our younger Tasmanians - and all Tasmanians, when it comes to our economy, the participation in the visitor economy - but most importantly our young Tasmanians. I do not only mean our young Tasmanians having the aspiration to play for AFL or AFLW - which are increasing numbers. The community feels it, because Auskick numbers are up around 40 per cent as I understand it, with increasing participation from young girls and women as well, which is fantastic. 

That is the momentum. That is the opportunity lost if the parliament chooses not to support the enabling legislation. I have been clear on that. I was having discussions with those opposite right here at the dispatch box three years ago probably, that if you kill the stadium, you kill the team and you kill the dream. I have been very consistent in that approach. What I simply outlined yesterday was the reality, and the reality is coming to a head.

You mentioned an upper House member, although not by name, but I understand who you are speaking of. I had a lengthy conversation last evening to put my position clearly on the table. It was a very respectful conversation and I respect the honourable member, Ruth Forrest, enormously. We have worked together for our respective patches over the course of the last 20 years. In fact, I understand that last week was Ms Forrest's 20th year in parliament.


Macquarie Point Stadium - AFL Deal

Dr WOODRUFF question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.25 a.m.] 
The majority of Tasmanians support the Devils but strongly oppose a stadium that we cannot afford. There is a club with over 200,000 passionate members and a mascot. Auskick, as you said, is up 40 per cent without a stadium. The momentum is already here. We do not need a new stadium to make our team viable. It will be a success no matter what because of the enthusiasm of Tasmanians over generations. We deserve a team, but we do not deserve to be saddled with $2 billion in debt just because the AFL wants things their own way -

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - I am trying to hear the member, thank you.

Dr WOODRUFF - You are putting all your energy into bullying Independent upper House members to support a corrupted legislative process. Rather than standing over the Legislative Council, why do you not do your job as Premier and stand up to the AFL for Tasmania?

Mr O'Byrne - Put the team in Swansea and be done with it.

The SPEAKER - Thank you, Member for Franklin.

Mr Abetz - It was funny.

The SPEAKER - I did say I would allow interjections if they were funny. That is fair.

Dr Woodruff - Be a Premier. Stand up for Tasmanians.

Mr Behrakis - That was not funny.

The SPEAKER - Okay, let us stop for a second and allow the Premier to hear the words.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. There is a lot to unpack in that question. First - and Mr O'Byrne and others would probably have a greater sense of this than me - but I got the sense that prior to this discussion, over the last three years, AFL was dying as a sport in Tasmania. What I see, with restructures from AFL Tasmania regionalising, is crowds coming back. You cannot possibly, hand on heart, say that the discussion about the Devils, the 200,000 members, the merchandise and the aspiration and the great feeling, you could not possibly say that that has nothing to do with the increase in Auskick numbers, seriously, because it has.

People have worked so hard to be in every region of Tasmania, from the gravel oval in Queenstown, to the north-west coast, the east coast, right across Tasmania. The AFL, Mr Brendon Gale, and the Tasmanian Football Club have really engaged in the Tasmanian Devils discussion and I commend them for it. I reject the premise of your question. I do not know how you could possibly say that, in actual fact.

I am committed to this project. I know it is an unpopular project. I know it is. I know the Devils are embraced around Tasmania, as they should be. We have to stand up and be counted.

At the end of the day, this is a building on a wasteland next to sewerage works that we want to transform and to recreate something huge for Tasmania - intergenerational infrastructure that can liven up Tasmania's economy. I really worry about the reputation of Tasmania if we cannot get a stadium up with all the opportunity for it, lose the team and lose the dream, in a place which has been ripe for development for decades, which no-one has taken action on, albeit the honourable member David O'Byrne and the current Prime Minister worked hard to secure $50 million, if my memory serves me correctly, to start the rehabilitation of the area. I do acknowledge that.

There has been discussion about what to do with Macquarie Point. It is ripe for development.

I reject any accusations about my relationship with the upper House; I have been very upright, factual and honest.

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.

Supplementary Question

Dr WOODRUFF - A supplementary question, Speaker?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Dr WOODRUFF - The supplementary question was what about the reputation of Tasmania; you have talked about the reputation for not being able to build a stadium, but the majority of Tasmanians are concerned about not being able to build hospitals and houses and they want the money spent on that instead.

You referenced the need for a stadium; we have two stadiums. Will you address the concern Tasmanians have and speak to the AFL on behalf of Tasmanians who want that $2 billion spent on houses and health care?

The SPEAKER - The member's time has well and truly expired for asking the supplementary. The original question is this: why do you not stand up to the AFL? The Premier certainly did talk about the reputational damage in his comment. I will allow him to answer your supplementary question on reputational damage only.

Mr Bayley - And your reputation for corrupted process.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I reject that, Mr Bayley.

Mr Bayley - You are bullying the upper House.

The SPEAKER - Mr Bayley, you will cease interjecting. You have done it consistently. You are warned. I am not going to tolerate the behaviour that we had on Tuesday. This view that somehow your passion and causes are so just that the rules do not apply has to stop. You are warned. If you wish to have a commentary about it, you can be warned twice. There are forms of the House that make people leave the House for long periods of time, with no capacity to come in and vote. I do not want to have to use them.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Honourable member, the stadium is required for the team's viability. It is well canvassed about the inappropriate venue of the Bellerive Oval - there is a need for stadium infrastructure like Adelaide Oval in close proximity to the city to create further interest in economic growth and investment. Without the stadium, the Devils do not stack up, okay? They do not stack up and so -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the supplementary has expired.

Dr Woodruff - How can you say that? How can you actually say that?

Members interjecting.

Mr Street - Because it is pure economics and hopes and dreams are not paying the bills.

The SPEAKER - The House will come to order. The Leader of the Opposition's voice is the only one I should be hearing now.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Funding and Capital Expenditure

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.32 a.m.]
If I am following correctly, you also now appear to be trying to claim that money borrowed by the Macquarie Point Development Corporation to build the stadium does not count as Tasmanian government capital expenditure. Are you actually serious? 

Minister Abetz, despite everything else he said on radio this morning, was at least credible enough to try not to pretend otherwise. He said:

Look, at the end of the day, any asset, every asset that is owned by the people of Tasmania, it will be, if you like, out of their pocket.

Tasmanians will be paying for this capital expenditure, so why do you not just admit that you have broken your promise?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. Yes, that is right and so, as I understand it, he mentioned that Hydro and other entities that also have borrowings as well, as is the normal course of action, so -

Mr Willie - We know why you went on radio before Question Time.

	The SPEAKER - Members on my left, having just been really quite strict with the deputy leader of the Greens, I am not quite sure why you think you will not be subject to the same rules.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Yes, I accept that, but I am not sure why the Labor Party put Mr Willie out anytime when it comes to media.

There is a difference between a capital investment of $375 million to build an asset. The MPDC is charged with developing the land; it has the power to borrow to do this and it will sell the land to private developers in future stages of Mac Point to support the repayment of borrowings. It is quite clear. We have always said borrowings have been in the agreement. 

Ms Finlay - When did you say that?

Mr ROCKLIFF - It has been in the business case. It has been very clear. 

The SPEAKER - The member for Bass and the member for Lyons. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - It has been very, very clear, member for Bass.

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The Member for Clark. Minister Ellis. The Premier has the call. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - I have been up front about the $85 million. Of course, that will be more than that, I suspect. It is intergenerational investment nonetheless, like an investment in enabling infrastructure across Tasmania from time to time. 

It is important to have some context. The honourable member for the Greens gets up and says, well, it is unpopular. You are unpopular, you are this, you are that. It is a tough sell. It is a tough sell, Dr Woodruff. I accept that.

It happens that tomorrow I will be celebrating 50 years of a company involved with the Tasmanian poppy industry that generates hundreds of millions of dollars a year for the Tasmanian economy: the only state, back then, to put its hand up to say we will have that industry here. Now we get the benefit of the beautiful flowers in November, December, and this state supplies half the world's legal raw material when it comes to supporting Tasmanians in pain relief. 

Members interjecting.

The SPEAKER - The Leader of the Greens. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Stephen King and those legends in the poppy industry stood up then. 

The SPEAKER - Member for Clark, you are warned. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Not a very difficult ask, but where would we be if we turned our backs when things got too hard?

The SPEAKER - A new question, thank you. The Leader of the Opposition has the call. Members will all be leaving the Chamber very soon, by the way.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Project of State SignificanceProcess Withdrawal Mechanism

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.36 a.m.]
Labor supports the stadium because it will create jobs and deliver the AFL and AFLW. 

Mr Ellis - It is hard to tell. 

The SPEAKER - Minister Ellis, you are warned. The member is allowed to ask his question in silence and, in fact, can do so from the beginning again, with starting the time. 

Mr WINTER - I am concerned you are putting all that at risk. You cannot unilaterally withdraw from a Project of State Significance process. You need the approval of the parliament. That means if your enabling legislation fails - and it seems like you are doing a pretty good job of making that happen through the Legislative Council - the POSS process simply continues. You have now told the ABC that Macquarie Point Development Corporation will not proceed with the project. Can you explain to the House what legal mechanism you will use to put an end to the POSS process, given there appears to be no withdrawal trigger in the legislation?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the honourable member for his question. I am pleased he is asking the questions because he was put in the freezer during the federal election campaign - a self-imposed freezer for the week when he has refused to ask me a question yesterday, for example. I know the party room. They were there yesterday.

Mr Winter - I did ask you a question yesterday.

Mr ROCKLIFF - They were there today, saying to you, 'Come on Leader, step up. You have to ask him a question. I know 'birthgate' is difficult but you have to ask a question' - and so here we are, which I welcome. Thank you very much for the question. 

A member - Are you going to answer the question the leader just asked you?

Mr ROCKLIFF - Yes. That is an interesting look between the Leader and the Deputy Leader. How did you know that?

Dr BROAD - Point of order.

The SPEAKER - Premier, I am hearing a point of order.

Dr BROAD - Standing Order 45, relevance.

The SPEAKER - I am very comfortable to call the Premier on relevance. Thank you, Premier, I will draw you to the question, please.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The legal mechanism is pretty clear. We have the agreement with tight timeframes. The legislation, should it not be passed, then those timelines become impossible to meet. The legal mechanism is to get the job done and support the legislation, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss that further with individual members as well as the continued support of those opposite.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - May I have a supplementary question?

The SPEAKER - I will hear the supplementary question.

Mr WINTER - Again to the question, the specific question was: can you explain to the House what legal mechanism you will use to put an end to the POSS process, given there appears to be no withdrawal mechanism in the legislation?

The SPEAKER - I think the Premier attempted to answer that, but I am happy for him to do so again.

Mr WINTER - I did not understand it, if he did.

Mr Duigan - Hear, hear.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you.

Members interjecting.

Ms Finlay - The one sole voice. It is lonely over there.

Ms Haddad - Are you going to kill it? That is the question.

The SPEAKER - Member for Bass and member for Clark.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you for the question. I will be working very hard, as I have always done, engaging with all members of parliament to ensure this legislation is passed. I do not know what you are saying, Mr Winter, in your question. Do you still support -

Mr Winter - Why did you announce it if you could not do it?

Ms Haddad - How are you going to kill the POSS? That is the question. You said you are going to kill it. How are you going to do that?

The SPEAKER - The member for Clark has been warned a second time. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease her persistent interjections. 

Dr BROAD - Point of order, Speaker, Standing Order 45, relevance. The Premier needs to address the question. Is there -

Mr Shelton - He is trying to get to it.

Dr Broad - No he is not. It took 15 seconds before he started talking.
The SPEAKER - Well, I could have drawn the Premier to the question, but he now has only 8 seconds to answer it, so it is entirely up to you how you want this to work. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - The question to Mr Winter is: do you support it or not?

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Adelaide Oval Comparison

Mrs PENTLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.40 a.m.]
You and other supporters of the stadium point to Adelaide Oval as an example of why it should go ahead. I recently toured the oval and yes, it is a very impressive venue, but other than its proximity to the city, I did not see a lot of similarities. Prior to the redevelopment, Adelaide Oval was already a world-class cricket ground surrounded by parkland with a train station at its doorstep. It has a capacity of 53,000. It is home to two AFL teams playing at least 22 matches a season. It hosts international cricket because it does not have a roof, and Big Bash cricket because it does not have shadow lines - not to mention the fact that it is supported by a local population of 1.4 million. The lesson from Adelaide Oval is that you need to get the basics right first. Will you concede your favourite comparison does not pass serious scrutiny?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. I thank you, and others, for exploring other states in a fact-finding mission. I disagree with the premise of your question because there are enormous similarities.

First, the opposition to the Adelaide Oval redevelopment was stronger than Tasmania. There was controversy over the bridge across the Torrens as well, which I think was a $20-million or $40-million investment, from memory. All very controversial. People fought and fought and fought against it, marches in the streets, et cetera, but no one can deny as a result of that investment that Adelaide has not changed.

I will go back to the point. You have mentioned two teams. First, we will have one team where we are all united - the whole state around one team. We will have a 23,000 seat capacity stadium as opposed to I think 55,000 at Adelaide Oval - an iconic stadium. All the areas that you mentioned are opportunities to address to ensure that they are opportunities that are realised in terms of working with Cricket Tasmania, Cricket Australia and the like.

When it comes to transport infrastructure, I know the member for Clark, Ms Johnston, is passionate about the railway corridor as well, as am I, but you have to have a corridor to somewhere.

Members interjecting.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Once again, that enabling infrastructure of the stadium will ensure, in my view, that investment over time will come down that rail corridor. There will be densification, in terms of housing and housing affordability and mixed housing as well. 
This is not just a debate for 2025, where it is highly political and highly charged. This is a debate for the future and future generations. I am not concerned about me in 2025; what I want is better opportunity for people in 2055, when it comes to this infrastructure, when it comes to our visitor economy, when it comes to a state that is perceived and realised as one that can get things done and overcome challenging hurdles and emotional argument, such as those that have been presented about the stadium.

The unlocking of enormous opportunities, when it comes to not only aspiration for our young people, but also positive development in Hobart, which is the capital city of Tasmania, and no doubt, others -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.


Mental Health Support for Retired Police Officers

Mr JENNER question to MINISTER for POLICE, FIRE and EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Mr ELLIS

[10.44 a.m.]
Almost two months ago I moved a motion calling on the government to immediately establish a fund for mental health support for retired police officers. That motion was passed, and I expected action to follow, yet last night I was informed that members of the Retired Police Association have had no contact from you or your department since. Can you confirm whether your department intends to deliver this support? If so, when it will be and what form it will take?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for his question and, of course, his considerable interest in this matter. David Plumpton and others from the Retired Police Association are, as I have mentioned previously, wonderful people and they do incredible work. In a previous question you asked me about the funding for this matter. We are working through a budget process at the moment and the Treasurer is doing a significant body of work on that.

Next sitting week will be budget week and we can work through those matters. I understand as well that you and I will be heading to the wellbeing support service here in Hobart in the coming weeks, so very shortly. I am really looking forward to the opportunity to work through things with the expert staff there who really are leading the country with their work in wellbeing.

Our government has a strong track record of delivering for our current emergency services. We are continuing to invest in the wellbeing service that every other police force in the country looks to as the model for how to do things well. We continue to invest significantly to support other emergency service workers after they finish their service as well. I spoke last time you asked a similar question about our nation-leading extension - world-leading, in fact - of the presumptive cancer list for our firefighters, particularly to cover our growing cohort of female firefighters.

I am looking forward to that meeting and looking forward to sitting down with you and the director of wellbeing services as we work through the particulars of the kind of action that you are looking to see, and working through with the Treasurer and the government in regards to future budgeting.


Salmon Industry - Mass Mortality Crisis - Independent Investigation

Dr WOODRUFF question to MINISTER for PRIMARY INDUSTRIES and WATER, Ms HOWLETT

[10.47 a.m.]
10 million kilograms of diseased dead salmon were hauled from once pristine waterways in just two months, 13 per cent of the annual statewide production. Unbelievably, you are happy to declare that this mass mortality event is over, despite March mortality figures being some of the highest on record. We still do not know yet what the April figures will be after the climate-warmed water temperatures we have had. This event is far from over.

In a recent briefing, the chief veterinary officer confirmed advice existed warning the government not to make a special carveout for Tassal in the biosecurity plan. Despite that warning, your government weakened biosecurity regulations and allowed Tassal to move fish and equipment between biosecurity zones at Okehampton Bay to the south-east zone.

You have never explained how Piscirickettsia salmonis moved to the south-east zone. It is the obvious smoking gun. Will you today commit to an independent investigation of this summer's marine catastrophe?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for her question. I want to make sure that everyone is aware that this is not a biosecurity failure. There are strict biosecurity measures in place to minimise the likelihood of the spread of pests and diseases within and between biosecurity zones, including approved effective cleaning and treatment program for equipment and vessels.

The natural movement of currents, particularly at this time, with the extension of both the Leeuwin and eastern currents makes it impossible to totally prevent natural spread.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Cost

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.49 a.m.]
The parliament will want to see how much your stadium and associated infrastructure will cost the taxpayers and assure themselves that the stadium can be built. Can you outline for the parliament how much the stadium, including all aspects of the project intended to be legislated, will cost?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. We will be informing all members of parliament on some of the concerns raised in the Planning Commission report; other concerns that have been raised around transport, access to emergency services, rehabilitation of the site, et cetera, some of the matters that Mr Bayley raised yesterday, contamination and others, I believe, including associated infrastructure. Mr Winter, you would also realise, I would hope and expect, that the associated infrastructure for a large development on Macquarie Point, including northern road access and the like, would be needed. There will be the investment in the stadium infrastructure, and there will be investment in other infrastructure to support the movement of people and the movement of public transport and the like.

John Cain Arena was also terribly unpopular, as I understand it, many years ago. There they had some particular values around environment and green spaces which were taken up by the John Cain Arena, if my memory serves me correctly. It was hugely controversial but it was established. There is now the Rod Laver Arena, there is the MCG, and it is a tremendous precinct.

Not all that was created right there and then. There is still infrastructure being developed in all these areas. As the population grows, as there are more opportunities for investment in hospitality and the visitor economy - this is not all going to happen in the next three years. We will be building infrastructure like the rail corridor, whether that be rapid bus transport - I know the member would like to see light rail - and these things happen over a number of years.

Members interjecting.

Mr Winter - Are you back on rail again?

Mr ROCKLIFF - I have referred to the member's view of this, thank you very much, Dean.

Mr Winter - You said, 'Whether be.'

The SPEAKER - I think we will stop the conversations over the Chamber.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The point of enabling infrastructure is that you still build capacity to support that infrastructure and the community to access that infrastructure, enjoy those opportunities, but also enjoy the private investment that will come around that enabling infrastructure as it develops over time.


Macquarie Point Stadium - Sewerage Works Relocation

Mrs BESWICK question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.52 a.m.]
Many Tasmanians fear your decision to abandon the Project of State Significance process will lead to corners being cut as you expedite to meet the AFL's timeline. The Tasmanian Planning Commission has highlighted a long list of things that need to be addressed before a stadium could even be contemplated. One of the key parts of the puzzle is moving the sewage works. Is this project on schedule? Given your dreaming that we can start construction on a stadium at Christmas, how can Tasmanians have confidence that the remedial work will not be rushed or overlooked?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question. We are committed to continuing our work with TasWater to ensure the timely decommissioning and demolition of the wastewater treatment plant at Macquarie Point, and augmentation of Selfs Point plant as well. I understand that our Treasurer was there a few weeks ago, there is now more than - $300 million? 

Mr Barnett - $300 million.

Mr ROCKLIFF - $300 million of investment. It has been given the green light by the EPA, with the chair of the board noting the project result in significant improvements to the quality of effluent discharge to the Derwent Estuary. That continues. The Treasurer at some point might like to add some value - his visit there more recently - and provide a more contemporary update to where it is at.

It contains three significant parts: the upgrade of the Selfs Point treatment plant, the building of a new pump station and storage tank at Macquarie Point, and the 4.3 kilometre pipeline, as I understand it, to transfer waste from the new pump stations to Selfs Point. I understand that work is well underway at all three sites. TasWater are undertaking extensive community engagement to make sure people in the area are aware of the project and how it might impact their daily commute. The advice that I have is that the project is on track for completion in late 2026. That advice is of early March. 


Macquarie Point Stadium - Roofed Design

Mr WINTER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[10.55 a.m.]
This morning on radio, minister Abetz, again, would not rule out bringing forward a high-cost and a low-cost design to parliament for your stadium, one with a roof and, presumably, one without a roof. Is it true that designs are being made for both a stadium with a roof and without a roof? Is your government in negotiation with the AFL to take the roof off?

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for the question, and I thank Mr Abetz for his engagement in this work and his stewardship of this project, alongside, of course, me. We are both committed to this project. The stadium will have a roof. It is very clear around the roof construction there.

I am not aware of any negotiations with the AFL. I have had discussions with the AFL CEO about a range of areas, including this project, and the roof is a challenge. We had a discussion about Cricket Tasmania and Cricket Australia's view of the roof. Mrs Pentland mentioned the shadowing and the light today, on which we will need to work and engage with Cricket Australia. I see it as a huge opportunity. I understand that the shadowing effects can be reduced by lighting around the ring of the roof structure to reduce the shadowing, to mitigate the shadowing concern.

Honourable Leader, we are committed to the roof. I say very clearly that the roof provides additional opportunity for all weather events. I look forward to progressing that.

Mr WINTER - Point of order, Speaker, just before the Premier sits down, I was actually getting some good information. I just want to remind him that part of the question that I asked him was whether it was true that the government was designing a stadium with a roof and without a roof?

The SPEAKER - That was the first part of the question. You will have the entitlement to do a supplementary if the Premier does not address it. You have 45 seconds.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you for the supplementary question.

The SPEAKER - No. Premier, that was a point of order. If you resume your seat, then he can ask a supplementary question, but if you are happy just to continue, we can avoid the supplementary.

Mr ROCKLIFF - My apologies. The version coming to parliament will have a roof, and we will continue to work with Cricket Tasmania on a number of their concerns.

Mr Winter - So you are doing two designs, one with a roof and one without. Is that right?

The SPEAKER - It is not a conversation.

Mr ROCKLIFF - No. I am just explaining this, please. We will continue to work with cricket to ensure it can be played there. I have mentioned some of the mitigating factors around shadow. There have been concept designs without a roof -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired. I am imagining I will hear a supplementary question.

Supplementary Question

Mr WINTER - Yes. Coming from the answer the Premier gave, in those discussions he mentioned with the CEO of the AFL, did the Premier raise the question of whether the roof could be removed as part of ongoing negotiations around the deal?

The SPEAKER - It goes to both the original question and the answer given by the Premier, so I will rule it in.

Mr ROCKLIFF - We had a range of conversations around some of the challenges of the roof in the context of Cricket Australia and Cricket Tasmania's particular view. The AFL is aware of that. Why would we not talk about that? It is a pretty sensible conversation.

Mr Winter - It is in the agreement. 

Mr ROCKLIFF - Cricket Tasmania has expressed a view.

Mr Winter - It is in the agreement that you signed that you said you would have a roof on it.

The SPEAKER - Members on my left, when you are getting an answer, it does not help if you interject.

Mr ROCKLIFF - The stadium will have a roof; I can guarantee you that.

Mr Winter - You were negotiating to have it off at the same time.

The SPEAKER - Leader of the Opposition. Order.

Mr ROCKLIFF - No, we were not, so do not put words in my mouth. Do not go out there and write all your silly media releases and all those types of things. Of course we would have discussions about Cricket Australia's view -

The SPEAKER - The Premier's time for answering the question has expired.


Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area -Bushfire Review - Annual Conservation Reporting

Ms BADGER question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF

[11.00 a.m.]
We understand that there will be an external review into the summer's fires that burnt over 100,000 hectares of precious Tasmanian landscapes.

Reviews have taken place after other significant bushfires and they have been public. It is imperative when evaluating emergency responses to draw on the vital knowledge of community members, walkers and botanists about the natural and cultural values of the impacted country.

Implementing key outstanding recommendations of past reviews is also crucial. The top recommendation of the 2016 bushfire Senate inquiry was to ensure that the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (TWWHA) was on the World Heritage Committee's annual state of conservation reporting cycle. It has recently dropped off.

As the Premier charged with overseeing the protection of the highest valued world heritage site on this planet, will you commit to requesting the new federal Environment minister re-elects the TWWHA for the annual state of conservation reporting? Will you ensure the review of the 2025 fire event is independent, public and examines outstanding past recommendations so we can improve responses into the future?

Dr Woodruff - Good question. It is so important for Tasmania's reputation as well.

The SPEAKER - To be fair, Ms Badger asked the question quite well on her own. Thank you, Leader of the Greens.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I thank the member, Ms Badger, for the question and her interest in this matter. Can I say how thankful I am for all the various agencies that worked so hard to put out the fires - the SES, Tasmania Police, the Bureau of Meteorology, Sustainable Timber, Parks and Wildlife Service.

There was an army of volunteers - I will call it that - from interstate and New Zealand, as I understand it. I know minister Ellis had a very close view of these matters in assistance as a volunteer, which I commend and admire.

Can I say that I had a briefing in Strahan with Parks and Wildlife at the time with Brendon Clark, from memory, who highlighted the huge 100,000 hectares of damage, if I can call it that. There is a stronger word for it.

There were strong winds, high fire dangers and soaring temperatures that made fire conditions unpredictable and fast moving, threatening several townships. I was able to engage with a few of the people who were supporting the fires from interstate. They were on the Tullah Oval and packing up. On behalf of all Tasmanians I gave my thanks to them and many others. I have mentioned 100,000 hectares with a perimeter covering more than 1400 kilometres.

Ms BADGER - Point of order, Standing Order 45 on relevance. It is about what we are doing moving forward. I appreciate that the Premier is thanking personnel for the important work that was done. 

The SPEAKER - The preamble covered the nature of the fire a little bit, so the Premier has some scope to address that, but I draw the Premier to the actual question.

Mr ROCKLIFF - Thank you. Notwithstanding the outstanding response, there are always learnings in these circumstances, and I have highlighted some of the complexity and the changing conditions and the like, which makes it difficult.

There will be a review undertaken. My understanding is the review will be public, as it should be, so people are aware of where we did really well and where improvements can be made.

Supplementary Question

Ms Badger - The Premier did not answer the other part of the question.

The SPEAKER - Are you asking a supplementary?

Mrs Badger - Yes.

The SPEAKER - The Premier has resumed his seat, so that is the mechanism you have.

Ms BADGER - A supplementary, honourable Speaker. The Premier did not answer the other part of the question, which was collaborating with the new or re-elected federal Environment minister to ensure that the TWWHA goes back on the World Heritage Committee's annual state of conservation reporting cycle.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I thank the honourable member for the supplementary question. You use the terminology 'collaboration', and there was great collaboration between federal and state government. I was keeping in touch with and communicating with the Prime Minister, and I thanked him publicly for their co-investment in these matters. Minister Ellis was engaging with minister Jenny McAllister on these matters as well, and I would expect nothing more than collaboration on this matter moving forward, whether it be the SES, the Prime Minister and Premier, or Environment. I can provide more detail on how that might look and look forward to providing that information.

The SPEAKER - Member for Lyons. The Premier has concluded his answer. Premier, I was not sure if you were providing more detail generally or to parliament on that.

Mr ROCKLIFF - I am happy to work with Ms Badger on further advice.

Ms Badger - Sure.

The SPEAKER - I am sure the member will have an opportunity to ask another question if she needs to another time. 


Macquarie Point Stadium - Legislative Council Support

Mr GARLAND question to PREMIER, Mr ROCKLIFF 

[11.06 a.m.]
You have now acknowledged this stadium will rise or fall on the votes of those in the upper House and it may come down to one member. You know full well there is a Legislative Council election on 24 May, and in my electorate a new MLC will be elected from Montgomery. 

On your timeline they will have to consider a complicated bill to rubberstamp your stadium in their first week of sitting in parliament. The same might occur for new members in Pembroke and Nelson. In effect, they will have to wade through over 4000 pages of complicated planning and financial reports, and possibly thousands of submissions from the public themselves, with only one staff member to assist them, all because you want to ram this stadium through the parliament as soon as possible to avoid scrutiny.

Premier, it seems you are prepared to break the budget for your stadium. Are you also prepared to break democracy in this state?

The SPEAKER - I will call the Premier to the question, and once again remind members that the Standing Orders require that we do not reflect on the upper House and the actions of the upper House, so in his answer the Premier needs to have regard for that.

ANSWER

Honourable Speaker, I do not agree with the way the member, Mr Garland, presented the question, but I thank him for it. 

This is a democratic institution where all members of parliament work solidly and hard to get across a lot of detail. We do that every single day. I want to make the point that we will work with members of parliament across various chambers to ensure that they are informed. However, there are consequences, and let us put this into context regarding the legislation and the consequences of the enabling legislation, should it pass or not.

We go through that every day. Legislation either passes or does not pass in the lower House and then the upper House. Sometimes it is amended in the upper House then comes back downstairs for further discussion - which is to say, there is nothing new in terms of the democratic institution availing themselves of all the information. We will ensure that everyone has the information, irrespective of their length of tenure in this place, to get across the issues, as challenging as it would be for a new member of parliament.

I concede that, but I am sure the members of parliament who are elected will embrace the opportunity to do that and become as informed as possible to make an informed decision. However, parliaments debate legislation; we will be debating legislation today, and when legislation is passed in the other place, nothing will change but it does go ahead in terms of legislation and new laws. There is change on the community.

There is nothing new when it comes to these particular discussions. There is nothing more democratic than a House of parliament. I know members will work diligently to get across all the issues and I know this is difficult for members and the pressure that they will feel from many sides of this debate and discussion. All I want is a respectful dialogue, respectful engagement, so people can be well informed, understand the consequences of the enabling legislation should it not proceed, and there will be consequences as we have spoken about before. I thank the honourable member for the question, but I can assure him we will support all members of parliament irrespective of their length of tenure to get across the information.

The SPEAKER - The time for answering the question has expired.

Time expired.


CONSTITUENCY QUESTIONS

CBOS - Consultation with Plumbers for 2018 Review

Ms ROSOL question to MINISTER for HOUSING, PLANNING and CONSUMER AFFAIRS, Mr ELLIS

[11.11 a.m.]
My question comes from Andrew, a plumber in Bass with decades of experience. Andrew holds concerns about the current Tasmanian occupational licensing system. He reports that the system is not fit for purpose, with supposed training offerings often little more than a gathering at the pub with scant actual training. Andrew made a submission to the CBOS Occupational Licensing (Continuing Professional Development) Determination 2018 review. However he considers the proposals suggested in the review are insufficient to address the problems with the point-based licensing system.

He is also concerned that those people who the government takes advice from for the licensing system are not truly representative of Tasmanian plumbers more broadly. Andrew asks: will you host face-to-face sessions with groups of Tasmanian plumbers and listen to them directly about their concerns and ideas for the licensing system?


MRI Wait Time and Condition Classification

Mr WILLIE question to MINISTER for HEALTH, Mrs PETRUSMA

I have made a few representations to you regarding my constituent, Sandra Burnett, from Glenorchy, regarding her time waiting for an MRI and scans on her ankles and feet and wrists and hands. Sandra's condition is worsening. She would appreciate advice as to whether her case, given her physical pain and exacerbated condition, can be upgraded from a category two to a category one or at least as to whether a timeframe for an appointment can be provided.

I request that you or your office contact Sandra in relation to this matter along with answering this question, as this is obviously adversely affecting Sandra's quality of life.


Northern Suburbs Sports Hub - Update

Mr FAIRS question to MINISTER for SPORTS and EVENTS, Mr DUIGAN

It is good to see construction of the Northern Suburbs Community Sports Hub progressing. According to the Infrastructure Tasmania website, members of my local community in Bass are expecting to see the hub open before the end of the calendar year. Can you please update the House and my constituents on the progress of these important works and that construction will be complete by the end of the year?


Longford - Tannery Road South - Roadworks' Cost to Taxpayer

Ms BUTLER question to MINISTER for INFASTRUCTURE, Mr VINCENT

My question is from John in Longford. Can the minister confirm whether all or any alterations to Tannery Road South in Longford, resulting from the permits granted by State Growth to Lowe's BP, will be a charge against the Tasmanian taxpayer?


Coordinator of Reportable Offenders - Appointment

Mr JENNER question to MINISTER for POLICE, FIRE and EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, Mr ELLIS

My question is from Mr Phil Bigg from New Norfolk. Can the minister affirm that the minister stands by the appointment of an individual to a position of Coordinator of Reportable Offenders of the Tasmanian Police Service, Reportable Child Exploitation Team, against whom the Property Agents Tribunal have made findings of false and misleading conduct, misuse of confidential information, misappropriation of information and confidential computer database and exportation of confidential information, all due diligence and screening processes involved in the lead-up to the appointment of this said above individual? 


Spirits of Tasmania - New Vessels Updates

Mr GARLAND question to MINISTER for TRANSPORT, Mr ABETZ

My question is from Bob in Devonport. On 2 March 2025, the Tasmanian government announced it had instructed TT-Line to continue preparations to relocate the vessel Spirit IV to Tasmania and that a further update regarding Spirit IV timelines will be provided in due course. More than two months later, there has been no update. Can the minister please provide a progress report on the new Spirit ships; information and a report on how much the ships are currently costing; information about where Spirit IV is as of today, May 8, 2025; on what date Spirit IV left or is leaving Leith in Scotland; and where in Tasmania it will be situated when it arrives?


Tobacco - Efforts to Disrupt Black Market Trade

Mr FERGUSON question to MINISTER for MENTAL HEALTH and WELLBEING, Mr JAENSCH

As you are aware, there is an increasing trade in illicit black-market tobacco and vaping products occurring across our state, including my electorate in Bass. My constituent is a legal tobacconist who must comply with strict rules of product supply, storage and sales. Legal tobacco sellers must also pay significant tobacco seller license fees to pay for the cost of government regulation. My question is: what is the government doing to disrupt and confiscate illegal product due to the failure of the federal government to stop illegal imports arriving in our country? Also, will you work with your colleague, the Minister for Police, and look at the work occurring in South Australia to disincentivise and shut down dodgy illegal sellers which include organised crime syndicates to identify new solutions that will assist our community in Tasmania?

SITTING DATES

[11.18 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House at its rising adjourn until Tuesday 27 May next at 10.00 a.m.

Motion agreed to.


MATTER OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

Macquarie Point Stadium - Conditions

[11.18 a.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House take note of the following matter: conditions for the Macquarie Point stadium.

It is clear from the Premier's recent words that members of this House will soon be voting on the proposed Macquarie Point stadium. My position on the stadium is very clear: we do not need a new stadium and certainly not at Macquarie Point. The cost is simply unaffordable, and the Tasmanian government should renegotiate the dud deal it made with the AFL so that we get the teams we deserve.

There are many members of this House who do not support this stadium, and it is vitally important that before we are required to vote on this, whether by enabling legislation or the Project of State Significance (POSS) process, that Tasmanians hear directly from their MPs. Will your support for the stadium be at any cost? Will your support be unconditional? Where is your line in the sand?

The Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) has given us a long list of issues that it wants the Macquarie Point Development Corporation (MPDC) to address. Today, I am asking members to speak to this matter of public importance to address those issues, and here are some of them - not a conclusive list.
Economic costs: we know at best the stadium will return 69 cents in the dollar. If we believe the total cost will be $775 million - as the government seems to do, but nobody else does - Tasmania will have to borrow in excess of half a billion dollars. How much is too much? Is a broken promise of '$375 million and not a red cent more' a broken promise that is too much to repair? Do you have a line in the sand in relation to costs?

Is it the public consultation process? Key stakeholders are clearly unhappy with the location and design: the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra (TSO), the RSL, the Hobart City Council, and the Aboriginal community. The government's proposed sidestep of the POSS process will not allow public hearings necessarily. Is your line in the sand removing public consultation on the project?

There are planning issues. The TPC has identified numerous planning issues including: the stadium's footprint, height and bulk are highly disproportionate to Hobart's small urban scale; it would obscure the natural hillside between the city and the Cenotaph headland, contrary to Sullivans Cove planning principles; it fails the precinct goals of integrated public spaces; it will encroach on the Antarctic facility zone. Is members' line in the sand 'trashing the Macquarie Point precinct plan and the visual amenity of Hobart's stunning waterfront'?

There are access and safety issues. The TPC says the current design does not leave enough room for pedestrians' flow, let alone emergency access. Perhaps your line in the sand is a comfortable experience leaving the stadium so people can come back and pedestrians are safe?

There are environmental impacts. The site is contaminated with asbestos, hydrocarbons and metals in soil and groundwater. There is risk of flooding due to stormwater issues, and the massive building will create wind issues - in the words of the TPC, 'discouraging people from walking or waiting outdoors.' Perhaps your line the sand is the safety of workers on the site and potentially of people attending games and events at the venue.

There is transport and congestion. The site constraints mean that the bus plaza will leave people waiting for up to an hour to get a bus after a game. Too bad if you are in a wheelchair - you will not be able to get on a bus at all. Of course, there is traffic and parking, and the Port of Hobart would be adversely affected on event days. The TPC believes events will require full or partial closure of roads, including Davey Street.

Is your line in the sand unmanageable traffic congestion, or is it the sale of prime public land, where the government's abandonment of private investment in the stadium - prime public waterfront land - can be put up for sale? Is your line in the sand the loss of access to public land?

Then, of course, there is process. Finally, over and above these issues outlined with the TPC, there is a matter of gross abuse of process. The cutting out of proper community consultation, the shifting of goalposts for planning processes dependent on the mood of the Premier, the blatant threats to MPs, the changing of commitments - '$375 million, not a red cent more', the lack of transparency, the lack of detail and accountability. The list goes on and on. Is this members' line in the sand, the attack on basic principles of democracy and good governance?

I urge any members of this House considering supporting the stadium to put their answers to these questions on the public record. When it comes to a vote in the stadium, where is your line in the sand? How much is too much?

[11.23 a.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, it is pretty obvious that the line in the sand for the member for Clark is absolute opposition to the stadium. Indeed, she betrayed all her arguments by her introductory comment, which indicated that this was about a stadium that is 'not needed'. What that tells me is that no matter what conditions we as a government might put on the stadium, the honourable member will oppose it, betraying her northern suburbs constituency like I cannot believe.

If you go out to Glenorchy, where the member used to serve as mayor and from where she gains a lot of her support, the people out there want the stadium. They love the stadium, they share the aspiration of the government and all those others who support the stadium because it will be transformational - economically, socially and, might I add, aesthetically as well. The industrial wasteland will be transformed.

I heard a bit of an interjection from the Deputy Leader of the Greens. Can I tell you the stadium will look a lot better than that Eden Project, which would have been higher and uglier than any stadium design for that particular area.

Mr Bayley - What about the previously approved master plan?

The SPEAKER - I encourage the Deputy Leader of the Greens not to bite.

Mr ABETZ - No matter what condition might be imposed, the member for Clark will still be opposed. We can do all sorts of things for the member for Clark in relation to the stadium, but she still believes it is not needed. If it is not needed, do not try to suggest to this House or any member of another House that they should be considering positions and conditions when everybody knows your true motivation, and it is fine to have that position, that you just oppose the stadium because it is not needed.

As a government, we believe it is needed. It is transformational for the city, it will be an iconic gateway replacing an industrial wasteland. It will be transformational socially, because what it will mean is we will have cultural and other events at this multipurpose stadium for the benefit of all Tasmanians and for our tourism sector, because it will ensure greater tourism activity. It will be economically transformational, not only during the build but, as the AFL have promised, $360 million over 10 years, $36 million each year, will be invested in grassroots football or AFL, including might I add, in Glenorchy. Right around the state it will be transformational. Talk to any law enforcement officer and they will tell you, 'Show me a suburb where there is high youth engagement in sport and I will show you a suburb where there is low youth engagement in crime.'

There is no doubt that already the hint of a football club and the AFL stadium has seen a surge and uplift in Auskick. Our young children, be it Lauderdale or be it down my way at Kingborough, there has been a huge uplift, socially transformational as well.

We are regaled with arguments of all sorts of things like this asbestos down there and it is contaminated. Did I hear those arguments when people were suggesting a hospital for that precinct? Not at all. You cannot play football there because it might somehow be injurious to health, but it is okay for a hospital? Please get real. This is manufacturing of argument after argument for the sole purpose of trying to derail what is a fundamentally important project for our state.

Honourable members, can be assured that we as a government will be continuing to pursue this multipurpose stadium, underpinned by an anchor tenant, which happens to be the AFL. Let the people of Nelson in particular be assured that if they vote the wrong way on Saturday 23, there will be no high performance centre in Nelson because there will not be an AFL team.

[11.28 a.m.]
Mr WINTER (Franklin - Leader of the Opposition) - Honourable Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this matter. I must admit though, and I do not like it, but minister Abetz sort of stole the start of my contribution. I have to say, the member for Clark opening her statement by saying that it did not matter what happened and she did not support a stadium sort of took away from the point she was trying to make. Her red line has been made very clear, which is that it does not matter what is presented to this parliament, it does not matter what stadium it is, she does not support it.

There have been some questions about misrepresentation in this place over this issue for years now. What is absolutely clear is that there is a misrepresentation that is going on by some that says that you can have an AFL team and not have a stadium. I know now, from speaking to the AFL, as I have on several occasions, speaking to AFL Tasmania that, unfortunately, it cannot be negotiated away. It is simply the case that if a stadium is not built, we will not get an AFL team.

Some from this place and elsewhere walk around and say that they support a team but not a stadium. I understand it. I had that view when we were talking about renegotiating the team. What is clear now is that there is a CEO, there is a mascot, there is staff and they are doing incredible work in heading towards a future AFL team. It is clear that, unfortunately - well, depending on your perspective, unfortunately from some people's perspective - it is simply the case that we will lose the AFL team if this is not. That is a dishonest point to continue to make: the idea that you can renegotiate the deal from here when we know that is not the case.

I was disappointed. I thought the minister might want to clarify some of his comments on Leon Compton's program this morning in his contribution, because they were quite extraordinary. The interview, for those who have not heard it, included one statement where minister Abetz told ABC Mornings listeners:

On Valentine's Day, 14 February 2024, the Premier specifically said $375 million capital import, Leon, plus borrowings. 

The reason why I asked those questions to the Premier this morning was to find out from the Premier if he could direct me to where he ever said that - one single occasion where he ever said that. I have read the transcript and he did not say in the press conference. I have read the press conference and he did not say it there. I have read the Examiner article, I have read the Mercury article, and he did not say that.

Perhaps minister Abetz made a mistake on the radio today, in which case he should arrive here in the House at his first available opportunity, which he had, and correct the record. It has been pointed out to him. However, he has not. I have serious concerns about that.

Tasmanians, whether you like the stadium or not, were told by Premier Rockliff in 2024, in February, that the stadium would cost $375 million of Tasmanian taxpayer dollars and 'not one red cent more'. Then he repeated it over a hundred times since. He was still saying it late last year. He has not been saying it in this place, but at the same time he seems to be claiming that money spent by Macquarie Point Development Corporation funded by debt is not part of Tasmanian taxpayer dollars. It is not true. Frankly, as I said earlier, no one would ever believe that, and yet they say it. It is so frustrating, because I support building a stadium and I support building a team, but I do not support dishonesty. I want to make sure that Tasmanians have a very clear idea of what this is.

I do want to know how much it will cost. I do want to make sure that it is constructible. I do want to make sure that the legislation is sound. I have raised some of these issues in my letter to the Premier, where I made it clear that Labor needs to see these things. I said that I expect and I require to understand the funding arrangements; how much it will cost. In the briefing it was not clear to me exactly what is going to be in this legislation. I asked about building approvals and how they will be provided and I was not given an answer.

I am passionate about Tasmania getting an AFL team. I think it will be so important for our state. I make the warning that I have given so many times before: imagine if Tasmania, having been in the headlines for getting an AFL team, having the Deputy Prime Minister standing at North Hobart with the Premier all over TV screens all over Australia - imagine if after telling the rest of the country that we are going to build a stadium, get an AFL team, we failed to do that, because the legislation was not sound or because of the way the Premier is treating the upper House. Imagine if that happened. It would be a tragic day for Tasmania. That word is - there are tragic instances, but it would be so sad for our Tasmanian young people in particular.

[11.33 a.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to debate this matter of public importance today. The issue of how planning conditions will be developed for the Macquarie Point Stadium, what those will be and how they will be enforced, are clearly critically important matters for this mega-project that has never been undertaken before, or anything to this scale in this state.

The Greens have real concerns about how the conditions will be developed and how much potential there is for government influence and interference. Given the Premier and ministers' 'stadium at all costs' approach and the tight timelines the Premier signed us up to in the AFL deal, it is not controversial to suggest the government will want these conditions to be as minimal as possible.

In our briefing with the department of Premier and Cabinet on Monday, it was clear that the whole process on developing this bill is a catastrophe. We are supposedly only weeks away from debating this bill, but there were very few answers to important questions. To be clear, that is not any reflection on the public service, it is a reflection on the impossible position they have been put in by this government. 

We were told the conditions for the stadium would pull in input from various departments and regulators. That is all fine and good, but where is the POSS process this input would have been assessed and actioned by with the independent expert panel? Here we have a government instead, the proponent of the stadium, writing their own conditions to be considered by parliament acting as a planning authority - a government who do not know how to do good planning - and this kind of interference in process is appalling.

Some of these conditions will be obvious and uncontroversial, especially those set out by independent regulators, but many will be about complex matters that have to consider various perspectives. That is where we feel the government may make sure they try to minimise issues and give themselves a smoother road.

The Greens were also told in our briefing that the government is actively considering giving a minister the power to oversee and enforce conditions placed on the stadium if it is approved by parliament. What will that look like? A minor amendment for the largest project of this state's history? It is a laughable concept. This is a deeply disturbing prospect. Given the government's 'build at all costs' approach, there is no way any minister could be trusted to honestly make sure these crucial conditions are being met.

There is no way anyone, even the Premier, believes that minister Abetz or any other minister would be unbiased in making big decisions about the stadium, especially given the ridiculous, tight timeframes the government has signed up to and the fact that they are pursuing the stadium at all costs - as if any member of the government would make a decision that might set back delivery of this project. We are not seeing that prospect at all. There is no doubt they would simply take a tick and flick approach, giving the go-ahead no matter how bad a problem might be. Giving a politician final sign-off on key parts of the stadium would be the government's worst corruption of process yet.

We twice asked the Premier to rule out the absurd and outrageous possibility in parliament, but alarmingly he would not do so. The Premier must not go down this road. He needs to ensure the bill that comes to parliament does not include any element of ministerial discretion, sign-off or ability to modify plans. 

The public deserves better. It deserves a government that does not ram through poor planning and poor process. The public expects scrutiny from this parliament and they deserve answers that the Premier fails to provide.

[11.38 a.m.]
Mr O'BYRNE (Franklin) - This matter of public importance debate is important. That process around this development and this proposal is important. It is really important it is done well. It is really important that all members of parliament have information before them on all the key issues so that we can make an informed decision. I agree with that in terms of the mover of this matter of public importance.

Let us not forget how we got here. The original proposal was part of an agreement negotiated between the state of Tasmania and the Australian Football League to establish a 19th licence in Hobart, and within that, the preconditions to the granting of the licence in the negotiation were a number of factors, including that of a facility where the club could generate revenue, underpinning the business model. That was a negotiation between the state of Tasmania and the AFL. These negotiations happen all the time, albeit this is a matter of clear public interest.

It was originally in the Major Projects process. Then, because two renegade Liberals - who have now lost their seats - put a gun to the Premier's head and said, 'We are going to knock you off unless you agree to move it out of there into the POSS process', the Premier, with no ability to say no, agreed to that. Otherwise, the government would have fallen and an election would have occurred.

The Greens argued against the POSS process. The POSS process is as popular as a Carlton fan in a Collingwood Life Member club. For the benefit of the Greens, Carlton is a football club, they are based out of Melbourne, as are the Collingwood Football Club. They play in the AFL league. The POSS process argued against -

Mr Willie - It is a bit rich having a Collingwood supporter talking about popularity.

Mr Bayley - Thanks for the lecture. Some of us are footy fans as well, mate. We just do not make a virtue out of it.

Mr O'BYRNE - Yes, I get that. We always have a bit levity about this because some of your arguments actually do not stack up. Anyway, we can talk about that until the cows come home.

We went to the POSS process, which no one likes. The POSS process has been disliked and been found difficult in any iteration of this parliament, and has caused other community grief. Now, consistent with virtually every other major project development of this type in every other capital city, there has been enabling legislation introduced into that local parliament.

I was very fortunate to meet with an old mate of mine and colleague, the Premier from South Australia, Peter Malinauskas, who talked about that and talked about the then premier Jay Weatherill, some of the concerns that were in the community, and how prior to that movement, the stadium had no friends. The last press conference Jay Weatherill did heading into the election was held at the Adelaide Oval, because it had to be moved out because the local council was incapable at that time of coming to some form of coherent process.

That is why we are here. It was great to hear Mr Winter, the Leader of the Opposition, talk about their support for the process. My reflection on his comments about how embarrassing it would have been if we had failed this project is that, well, he was part of a party that at the last election was opposing the legislation. There was a press release by a Labor candidate in the upcoming upper House election, which, only a number of weeks ago, referred to this project as the 'Premier's pet project'. That does not indicate a strong level of support, and that concerns me. 

I do not mind people who say, 'I do not support the team and I do not support the stadium'. I respect that, because their position is clear, but people who say, 'I support the team but not the stadium' - it is duplicitous. It means that you do not support the team by virtue of the real world reality of the business case that has been constructed.

When the member for Clark moves this - she has said very clearly she does not support the stadium, so bringing on an argument about process is disingenuous in my view. It is funny, when the TPC report was released, in a Facebook post the independent member for Clark basically had a crack at Labor for supporting the stadium. She said, 'It is time for Labor to step up and put an end to this madness'. Then a few days later in the debate on the MPI she said, 'Oh no, the TPC report is an issues paper. It does not mean to say that there are issues that are necessarily fatal to the project'.

Well, you either support it or you do not. It is either fatal or it is not. I ask people just to be consistent in their argument and to not use straw person arguments to try and divert attention and create divisions.

Time expired.

[11.43 a.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I rise to speak on this matter of public importance and thank the member for bringing it forward. I will start with minister Abetz's contribution, because he was talking about a heartland area in my electorate and I have to agree with his comments about Glenorchy. I have said it before in this place that some members, including the Premier - in fact, most members in this place - have been on a journey.

I know in the state election I was doorknocking in places like Chigwell, Claremont and Glenorchy. I was meeting Labor voters who said, 'I usually vote Labor, Josh, but I cannot do it this time, I am really sorry, because of your position on the stadium.' That was confronting and a challenge for someone like me who loves sport. I love my football. This is in working-class areas - good people, Labor people. That was what they were saying to me. I do not think it has changed much. I stand at Northgate, I have an office now in Glenorchy Central. People come up to me and they tell me about their support for the stadium and the teams and particularly the younger generations.

I have a son I have talked about, and he is doing Auskick. He is one of that 40 per cent growth statistic. He is absolutely loving it. In Auskick, they can choose from the 18 teams as part of their kit when they sign up, but this year they were able to choose Devils as well. He is at North Hobart footy club - I would prefer him to be at Glenorchy footy club, but that is another matter. At North Hobart footy club, he is there amongst a sea of children in Devils gear. They are excited about the future and what this team will do for the state, and the opportunities and the dreams.

I think this is going to be a challenging issue, there is no doubt about that, particularly for the Premier, and I will get to him in a minute. It is going to be a challenging issue in the short to medium term, nobody is denying that. I think in 30 years' time, when these teams have been established, men's and women's, we will look back and say it was the right thing to do. Yes, it was hard from a budget perspective. Yes, it was hard in terms of constructing it, but I do not think that as a state we will look back. 

That said, we have ministers like minister Abetz going on radio this morning and misrepresenting things, making contradictory statements. I was listening to minister Abetz on Leon Compton's show this morning and I thought, 'This is stupid. Why would a minister of the government go on Leon Compton right now and speak like this, trying to misrepresent things that have been said?' He almost threw the Premier under the bus at one stage. I thought, 'This is really silly; it is not very strategic on their part.'

Then it occurred to me that minister Abetz's reputation for the dark arts of politics is well known. I thought, 'This is actually strategic for minister Abetz. He knows that this project and the Premier's career are intrinsically linked, and he knows that if the Premier continues to mishandle this, then the Premier is putting his own career at risk along with the project and the teams.' I think minister Abetz went on radio this morning on purpose to offer the opposition a whole lot of material to give the Premier a hard time on this issue. He may deny that. That is up to him, but his reputation precedes him.

Mr Abetz - Is this comedy hour? 

The SPEAKER - Minister Abetz has the chance to say he is being misrepresented. 

Mr WILLIE - I can tell you, there is no greater risk now to the AFL teams than the Premier's handling of this. I know from being a former member of the other place. They do not like being wedged by the government of the day. They do not like being threatened by ministers or premiers, and they are very process-driven people. They are good people. They want the best outcomes for Tasmania. They are representing their electorates but they are also very dedicated to reviewing legislation and trying to get the best outcomes.

That is their job. You need to work with them; you do not need to threaten them. It will have the opposite effect, and I think the Premier has actually wedged himself. I think it is going to be a very fraught time. I said this yesterday in the media. This is a very high-stakes time for the teams, the project and the Premier's career, and minister Abetz knows that.

Time expired.

[11.48 a.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, I thank the member for bringing this matter of public importance for conditions for the Macquarie Point Stadium. I want to outline the conditions that have got us here because it is clear that this stadium is built on a foundation of deceit, disregard, contempt, fabrication, and now bullying, intimidation and standover tactics. It is absolutely reprehensible. It all adds up to a fundamental corruption of process. 

This is a very dark day for Tasmania. We have not seen this kind of corruption of process since 2007 with the pulp mill campaign and Paul Lennon ramming through special legislation, with the support of the Liberal Party, to facilitate Gunns' pulp mill. Look how well that turned out for everybody - Paul Lennon ended up on 16 per cent, Gunns ended up bankrupt and ultimately disappeared from the landscape, and the pulp mill never happened, thank God. It is a stain on this parliament, that particular part of our history.

When it comes to deceit, it goes all the way back to August 2022 when the Premier said that a stadium was not part of Tasmania's bid for a 19th licence. That was also replicated in the tripartite agreement between Labor, Liberal and the Greens, where the Premier looked the Greens members at the time in the eye and said it will not involve a stadium. Clearly that was fundamental deceit, and that deceit continues. We have heard the Labor Party repeatedly ask today about the $375 million and the deceit is layered across this entire stadium issue.

When it comes to disregard, it starts with his own people. The Premier completely disregarded the Cabinet before he signed up to the dud AFL deal. He completely disregarded Treasury, did not seek any advice from Treasury when it came to the stadium and whether or not we could afford it and, of course, he disregarded Tasmanians and that continues. When it comes to contempt, the abandoning of the POSS process - his own process - takes the cake. It is the process, it is the order that the Premier brought into this House, no matter how it happened, Mr O'Byrne, that is the process that was settled on by this House and simply because it is abundantly clear that the POSS process will not deliver a positive recommendation for the stadium, he is now leading an abandonment of that process.

He is still accepting public submissions, supposedly, and theoretically we are going to hear what the public think, but he is refusing hearings, and that is utter contempt. In doing so, he is not only abandoning the process and treating Tasmanians with contempt, but the Liberal Party and the Premier are absolutely fabricating the evidence and the reason for it. That was writ large yesterday in the debate where we sought to refer the Leader of Government Business to Privileges.

The SPEAKER - Without reflecting on a decision of the House.

Mr BAYLEY - A representation was passed off as legal advice, and on the basis of that legal advice, the government has sought to tear down the reputation of the Tasmania Planning Commission and its panel. The Premier came in here today and tried to attack me, attack being the best form of defence for besmirching the good name of public servants. Listen to what he is prepared to say on the basis of utterly flimsy legal representation to his own panel in the Tasmanian Planning Commission. This is from The Age just a few weeks ago:

Rockliff, who hit out at the report for failing to be independent, doubled down on his initial criticism.

This is a direct quote from the Premier:

My view is that they went in there with a predetermined view. From my point, it wasn't objective.

He is saying that the planning commission panel went in there and were biased from the start and that is besmirching the reputation of people who have been employed to do a job for Tasmania. A former Deputy Solicitor-General, no less, a former Treasury boss, no less; it is utterly reprehensible. We know that the fabrication was worked up by the proponent and the head of the State Service. I did not besmirch their reputation. I read into the Hansard, as is their right, what they inputted into the so-called legal advice, the legal representation; I read in their edits and the fact that it was based on track changes. Now, of course, the Premier is engaged in bullying and standover tactics, trying to blackmail the upper House into supporting his legislation. It is an utter contempt of process.

Mr SHELTON (Lyons) - Honourable Speaker, I would like to contribute a little bit to this debate and to come on board by simply saying the Greens, the anti-everything party, they have a reputation for that, and the reality is, in this instance, they are coming up with all the excuses why they want to keep the process going. It is what they did at the Meander Dam process, where they were anti-Meander Dam, and so they found every excuse they could to make sure that the process was lengthened.

SUPERANNUATION LIABILITY (GST WINDFALL FUND)BILL 2025 (No. 17)

Second Reading

[11.54 a.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Treasurer) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the bill be now read a second time. 

The bill represents a prudent and forward-looking measure to strengthen the financial position of the state by addressing a significant long-term liability. This bill delivers on a commitment of the government's 2024 election platform, our Strong Plan to fix Labor's unfunded super liability, which is a key element of the government's Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future.

Tasmania's unfunded superannuation liability is a legacy that is placing a growing burden on future generations of Tasmanians. This government is committed to taking real, practical steps to address that liability and secure the state's long-term financial sustainability.

The purpose of this bill is clear: to ensure that when Tasmania receives more GST revenue than forecast, that is when there is a windfall, we lock away a portion of that funding to pay down the state's superannuation debt. Under the provisions of this bill where actual GST revenue was reported in the Commonwealth's Final Budget Outcome report exceeds budgeted expectations for a given financial year, 50 per cent of that excess will be deposited into a newly created, specific purpose account known as the Superannuation Liability Fund.

This ensures that temporary or unexpected revenue increases are not absorbed into general expenditure, but instead are used to improve the long-term fiscal sustainability of the state. The establishment of this Superannuation Liability Fund under the Financial Management Act 2016 will ensure that these windfalls are used solely for the purpose of offsetting the state's unfunded superannuation liability. In doing so, we are creating a legislative safeguard that protects these funds from being diverted to other purposes. To be clear, the fund cannot be used for anything else without the explicit approval of both Houses of parliament. It also cannot be closed without the approval of both Houses of parliament, so this is about locking in financial discipline for the long term, not only for this government, but for future governments as well.

Under the legislation, the Secretary of the Department of Treasury and Finance will be responsible for determining whether a GST windfall has occurred in a financial year. This determination will be made within three months of the public release of the Final Budget Outcome, which must be no later than 31 January each year in line with the release of the Treasurer's Annual Financial Report under the Financial Management Act.

Once a windfall is determined, 50 per cent of that amount will be allocated to the Superannuation Liability Fund. The Treasurer will then, from time to time, transfer money from the fund to the Retirement Benefits Fund to directly reduce the state's unfunded superannuation liability.

This is a smart, responsible and future-focused reform. It strengthens our financial position, it ensures intergenerational fairness, and it sends a clear message that this government is serious about prudently managing the state's finances prudently. 

Honourable Speaker, I commend the bill to the House.

The SPEAKER - I have a view on politicisation of the second reading speeches, which I cannot have from the Chair.

[11.58 a.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, that will come to my opening remarks. This is purely about politics, and it looks to me like this is a Brad Stansfield special in an election campaign. He has talked at length about this issue on his podcasts, and I know that he was involved in the Liberal campaign at the time.

We had a government whose economic performance and managing of the budget has been so poor that the biggest liability - the growing liability - in the budget, that has been baked in by no one else except for this Liberal government, is the rising debt servicing costs. That is about to overtake the superannuation liability as being the largest liability to service in the budget, purely down to their policy decisions.

They were desperate in the campaign to point to something else. The facts matter. When Labor left government, there was cash and investments in the bank. We now have record debt under this government - $9.6 billion and counting. It is not stabilised; it is completely in freefall. We have no plan to stabilise it yet, no credible plan from the Treasurer.

That is the origin of this policy, I believe. Brad Stansfield has had some influence on public policy in Tasmania in election campaigns. Sometimes that is not necessarily in the public interest; it is purely down to the Liberal Party and their interests. That said, I can indicate that the Labor Party will support this bill. I can see some merit to it.

I want to thank Treasury officials for the briefing provided this week. The dedicated people in Treasury are doing a very difficult job at the moment, no doubt, given the state of the state's finances. I would say there are a few worried people over in that building.

As the Treasurer said, the purpose of this bill is to establish a specific purpose account to be named the 'Superannuation Liability Fund'. The purpose of this Superannuation Liability Fund is to provide funds to offset the unfunded superannuation liability of the general government sector for Retirement Benefit Fund (RBF) Contributory Scheme members and pensioners.

The bill establishes a mechanism to calculate and pay into the fund 50 per cent of any GST windfalls in a financial year. The GST calculation is quite complex. It is about relativity population in the total pool. This calculation is done each year. It is probably beyond my skills as a primary school teacher to calculate that.

We are very fortunate to live in a country like Australia, where there is horizontal fiscal equalisation, which is based around the principles of 'It should not matter which state you live in; you should enjoy the same services and infrastructure and quality of life.' We are very fortunate to live in a place like Australia, particularly in Tasmania, where we have that horizontal fiscal equalisation. It is much different to other examples across the globe - America being one. There are very poor states in America where people do not have the same quality of life. We are fortunate from time to time to have GST windfalls. The GST windfall will be calculated in the year after the windfall occurred for this provision, with 50 per cent of the windfall calculated, if any, to be transferred into the fund at that time.

The legislation restricts the use of money in the fund, whereby it may only be transferred to Retirement Benefits Fund to be applied to the unfunded superannuation liability. There are two ways that it can be applied to that: one is through a lump sum to be vested by the RBF; the other is to service the pension cost, and I will get to that in a moment. The RBF has a more aggressive investment strategy and more than likely higher returns. A prudent government may see a benefit from time to time handing that over to RBF to manage in an investment fund, because it will grow over time and help offset the liability.

I did hear in the briefing that there may be tax offsets from time to time which actually means that it is beneficial for it staying on the government books.

What I can see is this is a smoke and mirrors provision purely about politics, because this government is not a responsible financial manager. I think what will end up happening under this government is the funds will not build up in this account. They are effectively moving the funds from the public account, from the GST windfall, in through this account and then they will be servicing the pension costs which they would have done from the public account anyway.

It is total smoke and mirrors. That said, there are provisions in here, like I just described with the RBF and lump sums where a prudent government, a responsible economic manager, could actually maximise the investment and try and offset the liability.

We are onto this. We know that it is all about politics, Treasurer. That said, I think there are some provisions here that could be beneficial for a responsible manager of the budget. That is not you. It is very similar to the TT-Line Investment Fund.

I can indicate that the Labor Party will be supporting the bill.

[12.05 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to give my comments on the Superannuation Liability GST Windfall Fund Bill 2025. As we heard from the Treasurer, this bill effectively does two things: it establishes a superannuation liability fund that can only be used to offset the unfunded superannuation liability; and, second, it mandates that 50 per cent of GST windfall be paid into that fund and it is silent, irrespective of the status of the budget. Whether the budget is in surplus or whether the budget is in deficit, it mandates those windfalls be paid in there.

We fundamentally consider that a superannuation liability fund that is firewalled for the purposes of the unfunded superannuation liability has merit and we are prepared to support aspects of the bill but, as I will detail, we have some amendments and some thoughts.

I want to echo some of the words of the opposition treasury spokesperson to say that this is deeply political. This was announced, I think, just three days out from the election on 20 March 2024. The headline is 'A Strong Plan to fix Labor's unfunded super liability'. We should not be under any illusions as to where this strategy is coming from and what it is trying to do. 

I want to make the point that the size and the scale of the unfunded liability burden is not simply Labor's fault for 'raiding' the fund that was previously established. I want to make the point here and now that it is bigger than it needs to be because this government, the Liberal government, in 2017 assumed responsibility for $103 million of Forestry Tasmania's superannuation liability debt. Whereby a GBE should have been providing for its obligations to its retired employees, they did not. They repeatedly did not. This government, in another effectively underhand strategy for Forestry Tasmania, assumed liability for that obligation.

Treasurer, it is not all Labor's fault. You yourselves have assumed some of this liability by absorbing what that company or that GBE should have been providing for. Of course, it is a loss-making venture and so over consecutive years it simply was unable to meet its obligations.

I want to come now to the fact that, while we in principle support the notion of a superannuation liability fund and it has some merit, we are deeply concerned. We are not persuaded that the mandated 50 per cent of a GST windfall be paid into this account is sound fiscal policy. It sounds good. It sounds logical and it sounds sensible and prudent, as the Treasurer has asked us to believe, but there are some hooks; there are some catches on it. We understand from our briefing, and perhaps Treasurer, you could confirm this, and I ask you to confirm this for the benefit of the House and for the Hansard, that there has been no assessment of the impact of such policy on the budget bottom line. This comes from an election policy and not expert advice.

What I mean by that is: have you done an analysis about whether the GST windfall or 50 per cent of the GST windfall in any one year is better off being put into a superannuation fund and paying down the superannuation liability than it is actually paying down debt or funding normal spending?

The Greens' initial reading on this legislation was that in circumstances where the budget is running in a deficit, the allocation of a GST windfall into a fund would effectively require the borrowing of additional funds in equal measure in order to fund budget items. While on one hand we are paying into this fund, on the other we have to borrow and this means that the net impact on the budget would depend on comparing any interest accrued in the liability fund to the debt repayments associated with the additional borrowing. Treasurer, I would really appreciate your clarity on whether some modelling was done on the benefits of this to the budget bottom line. 

Assuming the government, as we were informed in the briefing, has not conducted any assessments of this, much less provided evidence to the House, we are concerned that the bill would have a negative impact on the budget bottom line. We have also sought some external advice on this proposition, which has confirmed our concerns and specifically we were advised that payments in such a fund would only make sense when the state was running a cash surplus. In fact, the person we spoke to who is an eminent economist we all know and quite often quote, said this was a gimmick. Unless we are running a cash surplus, this fund is a gimmick and it is clearly a political gimmick. While we support the notion of this fund, we think it can be cleaned up to make sure that it is not a gimmick and it is a genuine fund that helps the budget. 

Saul Eslake's 'Independent Review of Tasmania's State Finances' recommended investing for the purposes of defraying the unfunded superannuation liability, specifically when there is a cash surplus. Implicit in that recommendation, in my mind, is that when we run a cash deficit, as we are doing repeatedly and as there is no genuine pathway to surplus in the near future, this kind of fund and this kind of mandated payment of any GST windfall into this fund would be a net detriment to the budget. 

Saul Eslake's report also notes that other state strategies for unfunded superannuation liabilities involve investing only when there is a cash surplus. On this basis, we do not support the bill as it currently stands. It is not well thought through. It is political and the evidence we have received points to this being bad fiscal policy and the government has not done the work to indicate otherwise. 

We are willing to support a superannuation liability fund. On this basis, as has been distributed to all members, it is our intention to move to have the bill withdrawn and redraft it to remove the provisions relating to the GST windfall. We are prepared to give the government the opportunity in the first crack at reconsidering this in a really considered way with the assistance of Office of Parliamentary Counsel (OPC) to make it more beneficial and clearer and to be a net positive from a budgetary perspective. 

Should this motion not proceed again, I have distributed the amendments and we intend to move to restrict the fund and restrict the mandated investment of GST windfall to circumstances where the general government sector is running a cash surplus. With our amendments passed, we would support the bill. Otherwise we intend to vote against it. 

To foreshadow the amendments, hopefully we will not get there because hopefully the amendment to withdraw the bill and have it redrafted will pass. We have three amendments and all serve to restrict the mandated investment of a GST windfall to circumstances where the general government sector is running a cash surplus. 

Our first amendment introduces a definition of a cash surplus and relocates the current definition of budget papers from Clause 4 to Clause 3.

Our second amendment removes this definition of budget papers from Clause 3.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr Bayley, could you distribute those amendments?

Mr BAYLEY - I can distribute these amendments, but I am not moving these amendments at the moment.

Mr Barnett - You said you wanted it withdrawn.

Mr BAYLEY - I am just foreshadowing the amendments we would move if it was not withdrawn.

Our second amendment would remove the definition of budget papers from Clause 3. This is because the definitions contained in Clause 4 only applied to that clause, and our definition of the cash surplus in Clause 3 refers to budget papers. The effect of this is to ensure the definition of budget papers applies to the whole act, not just Clause 4. A third amendment would amend Clause 5.

I can see the Clerks talking to the Speaker. Let me start with moving the amendment that is pursuant to Standing Order 194. I move -

Leave out all the words after 'That'

Insert instead 'The Bill be withdrawn and redrafted to remove provisions that require a GST windfall to be paid into the Superannuation Liability Fund.'.

To speak to that amendment, I have obviously already spoken about it, but clearly we are concerned about the fact that this mandated GST windfall gets paid into this fund irrespective of the health of the budget, whether it is a deficit or a surplus. As we have been advised externally and as we suspected, it would only be guaranteed to be beneficial from a budgetary perspective if we were running a cash surplus. We have not run a cash surplus for some time. We are not expected to run a cash surplus. We do not expect us to run a cash surplus anytime soon, so this is really important.

Instead of moving our amendments in the committee stage if this fails, which I think is less ideal, this amendment to withdraw the bill gives the government the opportunity to, in a really considered way with its Treasury officials, with OPC, to consider what I am putting here to get and to seek external advice and to make sure that this fund is not indeed just a gimmick to put some political heat on the Labor Party, but it actually serves the interests of Tasmania, it serves the interests of the budget, and it is indeed sound fiscal strategy. 

On that, I urge members to support the amendment. Give the government a second chance to actually take this away, remove the politics and make sure that it is guaranteed to act in the interests of Tasmanians and the budget.

[12.16 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Treasurer) - Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to speak on the second reading amendment by the Greens to withdraw the bill and rewrite it. That is a political stunt, that is what that is. We will not have a bar of it. We will not be supporting that.

This is consistent with our Strong Plan to deliver responsible financial management. The Greens know that. The public know that. This is an attempt by the Greens to distract the government from our election commitment, because that is exactly what we have been doing for more than a year now. We have been implementing all the commitments that we have given to the Tasmanian people at the election.

It is called democracy. It is called stepping up. The Premier stepped up after the election and said, 'We will govern as a minority government, we said we would do it in collaboration and with goodwill,' and the Premier did that. He stepped up on our behalf. He said yes, so our job is to implement those promises. Guess what? That is what we have been doing for more than a year. We have got a 100 Day Plan after a 100 Day Plan after 100 Day Plan. Guess what? We have another 100 Day Plan. We are getting on with our plan.

This was a commitment given to the Tasmanian people. In fact, the former treasurer, who is here and no doubt will speak on this bill shortly, for which I am very grateful for his leadership in delivering responsible budget management. That commitment was given to the Tasmanian people.

I am looking forward, with some confidence, to delivering my first budget on 29 May, in just a few weeks' time, which will be demonstrating that investment in Tasmania and Tasmanians. That is what it will do. It will grow Tasmania's economy. We are already at a record more than $40.6 billion in gross state product, but it will grow Tasmania's economy. It will support business and industry.

I will be delivering a budget that does not rely on raising taxes on hardworking Tasmanians, which is the alternative plan of state Labor. I could say more about that, and I will later. We will have a sensible pathway to surplus in that budget that I will deliver on 29 May. That is despite being lumbered with the legacy of Labor's $1.5 billion raid on the special purpose account. It was established, was in operation, and the Labor-Greens government raided it - $1.5 billion that was there to provide for the superannuation liability obligations of all future governments. My budget will get the balance right.

With respect to this second reading amendment, I draw colleagues' attention to the fiscal irresponsibility of the Greens, which is to tax, tax and tax the Tasmanian people, businesses alike, and of course, any business that is a little bigger than a small business, they will cop it in the neck.

In terms of fiscal irresponsibility, Dr Woodruff made a comment on the Hansard, on the public record, and I will read it in, in terms of the estimated cost of the stadium, where the member Dr Woodruff said:

That means $76,000 a year of debt for every man, woman and child in Tasmania.

It goes on to say:

It is critical we continue to speak the truth about what is going on here.

What does that work out to be? $76,000 per year, per man, woman and child? We know the population is more than - let's go for 570,000. You multiply that by $76,000, and what does that come up to?

Mr Ferguson - A lot.

Mr BARNETT - It is more than a lot. My calculation is about $43 billion. We are talking more than $43 billion. Dr Woodruff, do you stand by that claim? You talk about misrepresentation and wild claims - well, that is one wild claim. I ask the Greens to back in this claim of some $43 billion that they made on the public record yesterday through their leader.

Mr BAYLEY - Point of order, Standing Order 45, relevance, Deputy Speaker. The Treasurer is on a political diatribe. He has attacked Labor, he is now attacking us. Can you get to the substance of the bill and the concerns that we have raised about cash surplus and cash deficit?

DEPUTY SPEAKER - It is not an opportunity for you to make another argument, Mr Bayley. The point of order was relevance. I am sure the Treasurer is coming back to the bill itself.

Mr BARNETT - Thank you, Deputy Speaker. The relevance is to the second reading amendment, which is to withdraw the bill. I am more than happy to respond to your amendments. I will be doing that; do not worry about that. The other specific amendments - your second reading amendment, which is the one we are debating right now, is to withdraw the bill, and you are trying to back in the fact that you are fiscally responsible. I am making it very clear that you are not fiscally responsible.

In fact, I have evidence of the last 24 hours where you said with respect to the stadium at $76,000 for every Tasmanian, for more than 570,000 Tasmanians. You multiply those numbers together and you get $43 billion. I do not know how you justify that, I am just saying. This is just absurd. Your fiscal irresponsibility knows no ends. This particular bill is consistent with being fiscally responsible and that is the point I have made.

The finance minister, shadow treasurer, made reference to the fact that it was a gimmick. Well, guess what? This is no gimmick. This is fiscally responsible and credible budget management and a commitment we gave to the Tasmanian people. We will not be lectured by Mr Willie or state Labor on budget management. We will not be lectured by Mr Willie because in terms of the track record, and with respect to this matter, state Labor's solution to budget management was a sugar hit on that special purpose account, to withdraw and to use the $1.5 billion of that special purpose account for other purposes. Just a few days ago, through that condolence motion, we commended the former premier and former treasurer, Tony Rundle, and we said rest in peace, but we also commended the former premier and treasurer for establishing that superannuation guarantee liability account.

That is a credit to the former premier and treasurer, Tony Rundle, for what he did. That was the foresight he had, but state Labor-Greens raided that $1.5 billion. What has that budget mismanagement actually meant to the budget management and the coffers in Tasmania? It means we are now paying some $350 million a year to fund the superannuation cost of our retired public servants. That is what that means.

That is $350 million a year. That is the cost and that is the impact of that Labor-Greens mismanagement of our budget, the raiding of that superannuation guarantee fund. This is what motivated the former treasurer to make this announcement on all our behalves during the election campaign, to lock in legislation, the very important mechanisms which is set out in this bill.

We will not be withdrawing this bill. We will continue our efforts to deliver fiscally responsible budget management for this state. As a state Liberal government, we were left to clean up the mess of the Labor-Greens government as usual.

Ms Dow - Record debt.

Mr BARNETT - It will only get worse. I have said $350 million per year, but it will only get worse as the annual bill will rise to nearly $500 million by 2035 is my advice. That is a debt that is directly attributable to the failed Labor-Greens government and their mismanagement. We will not be lectured by state Labor, by Mr Willie, we will not be lectured because they have no credibility, not a shred of credibility on economic and financial management.

We can only surmise that state Labor will raise taxes. I have made it clear but they have not responded. We want them to come clean with an alternative budget, to come clean with one costed policy. The chance will be, in just a few weeks time, to deliver that alternative budget. There they were, backing in the federal Labor budget, just more than a month ago, with a trillion dollars of debt and deficits for 10 years. We will not be doing that.

You will see that we will have a pathway to surplus. We are delivering a strong economy, record low unemployment, and high wages growth. We are getting on with the job: business confidence under the NAB survey for the last two months, we are at the top for every state in Australia. That is much appreciated, but that is because we are backing business and backing industry. I know that goes up and down from time to time, but we are very pleased with the confidence levels of the business community. I tabled this morning the Government Business Governance Reforms Bill: really important legislation that backs business and industry and will deliver a team Tasmania approach.

In relation to this particular second reading amendment by the Greens, we will not have a bar of it. It is a stunt to try and distract the government from our efforts to deliver fiscally responsible, most professional and sensible budget management. We will continue to do that.

Can I just give at this juncture a huge thank you to my Treasury officials for their hard work with respect to the preparation of the budget, not only the preparation of this bill. I thank them for the briefings that they have offered. I acknowledge that from the other members here and I know those briefings are being offered, which is appreciated. They are very dedicated, professional, and hardworking public servants. I want to put on record my sincere thanks to them for past weeks and months, and for the coming weeks in advance of the budget on 29 May.

Other members want to speak on this, I am not sure for the second reading amendment or the actual bill itself - either way, most appropriate. I reject that second reading amendment and will not have a bar of it.

[12.29 p.m.]
Mr WILLIE (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, what a lot of diatribe that was. They did not even try and defend the infrastructure being set up; the framework being set up. There was just a whole lot of political diatribe. He did not even attempt to make an argument on how this could be beneficial.

It is a real worry that we have a Treasurer of Tasmania who does not understand the budget. He talked about the Superannuation Provision Account (SPA) like it was an account that you drew cash out of, money out of; it was not. It is an accounting provision. I have heard the Premier repeat other mistruths. They do not actually understand the budget. It was an accounting provision because the government had cash and investments that could be used for any purpose. The accounting provision reflected the balance sheet. What happened during that time, through the GFC, was the government-funded deficit budgets with that cash and investments. If you ran into trouble in your household, you would use your cash reserves rather than taking out a loan.

It is a very big worry that the Treasurer stands in this place and he does not actually understand the budget, for starters. The second thing he did was he did not even try and mount an argument for this change. I indicated in my second reading speech that there could be a benefit to this. Handing over lump sums to the RBF to invest more aggressively than what the government does could provide greater returns. That could grow over time, snowball over time to offset the liability. This may be more beneficial than just paying down debt on the government's books. I will not be supporting the withdrawal of the bill because a prudent government - this is not a prudent government - could actually use those sorts of features, the tax offsets, to actually maximise the windfall.

Did this Treasurer try to mount that argument? No, because he does not understand the budget. He embarked upon a whole lot of political diatribe, including talking about a strong plan to deliver - deliver nothing but record deficits and record debt and the poorest financial management ever in this state.

It is all very well for him to accuse former governments of what they did, but they have been in power for 11 years. Through the start of their government they claim that they were turning the economy around and there were surplus budgets. What did they do about this issue? Nothing - absolutely nothing for 11 years. When do they raise it? When they are desperate, because they have absolutely destroyed Tasmania's finances. What is the biggest rising liability in the budget? It is their debt, their debt-servicing costs, which will far outstrip this liability. This liability is actually peaked. The servicing costs peak in 2035. The way they are going, their debt-servicing costs are going to be far greater for far longer. That is the real problem with the state budget at the moment.

This is a gimmick. It is highly political. We had the Treasurer just go to the politics just then. He is talking about 100 Day Plans and 'We are delivering on our commitments.' I said in the outset of my speech, this looks like a Brad Stansfield special.

Another one, which has not seen daylight, is the stability clause. Remember that one? It was where members of parliament were going to be removed from parliament if they left their party. What happened to that? It has quietly been forgotten about. It is embarrassing now, but was used as a threat in a political campaign. We have seen members leave their party in this parliamentary term. They may have lost their seats under that provision.

A member - I would suggest it is unconstitutional, actually.

Mr WILLIE - Absolutely ridiculous, undemocratic -

DEPUTY SPEAKER - I will need to draw you back to the topic at hand, Mr Willie.
Mr WILLIE - I am enjoying this.

Members interjecting.

A member - Do you want a mirror as well?

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Just somewhere relevant, please. Thank you.

Mr WILLIE - Yes, okay. I am just going to some of the things that were mentioned by the Treasurer. He did mention GSP growth. What he failed to mention was that a lot of that growth is underpinned by public sector debt funding. It is not just me who says that; Saul Eslake says that. There have been job losses in the economy, lots of jobs. Thousands of jobs have been lost since this government went into minority.

It is all very well for the Treasurer to stand here and demonstrate his lack of understanding of the budget, speak about a whole lot of things and misrepresent them, and not make an argument to oppose this amendment from the Greens - I have done that. You would have thought the Treasurer would have done that.

We will not be supporting this. It is a gimmick, but there are actually provisions in here that may be beneficial in being a responsible budget manager. That is definitely not them. The state's finances have never been worse.

[12.35 p.m.]
Ms JOHNSTON (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I rise to support the amendment moved by my Clark colleague, Greens member Mr Bayley, because what we have before us is clearly a gimmick designed to try to wedge Labor over an issue that some would say has caused them some embarrassment over a number of years.

My concern is, whilst I do recognise the desperate need to deal with this significant liability, that the government again has indicated that it has little regard for expert opinion, and again has ignored what Mr Eslake has said in his report and his recommendations. It is only when kicking and screaming that this parliament brings the government to account on those recommendations, to try and bring the government to act on those recommendations, that he does.

As for the record, I want to make it really clear, on page 102 of Mr Eslake's report on the state's finances, when talking about the superannuation liability, Mr Eslake says:

If and when the budget does return to cash surplus - something which seems unlikely it the next five years - the Government should consider again applying some or all of those surpluses to investments which can be used to defray the unfunded superannuation liability (as opposed to repaying debt). If so, it should also put in place stronger safeguards to ensure that any such funds are not subsequently withdrawn to meet short-term exigencies.

It is quite clear here that we are not going to be reaching a surplus. In some of his public commentary, Mr Eslake has remarked that the only pathway to the surplus you could possibly see is if you stand on your head and look at the projections upside down. It has been a very long time since I have been able to stand on my head. I am not sure if the Treasurer can, in fact, stand on his head, but I cannot see a credible pathway to surplus, certainly not, as Mr Eslake says, in the next five years.

This is not urgent. This is irresponsible, if we were to mandate that GST windfalls, part or portion thereof, were to go to a superannuation liability financial fund. That is not to say that there is not merit in a superannuation liability fund, and there certainly is in the position that we have cash surpluses, but that is not the case now and is unlikely to be the case in the next five years. What we have before us is a bad bill that needs redrafting.

Now, if the Treasurer is true in saying that he wants to express an intent about fiscal responsibility, then take the advice and the words of Mr Eslake, and bring forward legislation that reflects that - not a cheap political stunt or a gimmick. I would strongly urge the Treasurer to support the withdrawal of the bill and have it redrafted so that it is proper sound financial management reflecting the very expert advice of Mr Eslake, and not a cheap political stunt trying to wedge Labor. That is not how you get good financial management in the state. It is not helpful and conducive to good debate in this place.

Time and time again, we have seen bills brought before this place that have not been thought through; that have been brought on very quickly. I suspect we might see one later today brought on very quickly to try to wedge and make a political stunt out of really serious and important issues. It is deeply disturbing.

[12.46 p.m.]
Mr BAYLEY (Clark) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, it is disappointing. Our withdrawal motion was an opportunity for the government to go away, get expert advice and give considered reform to this bill. Given that we are still debating the bill, we will go to Committee. As foreshadowed, we have a number of amendments that seek to achieve the outcomes that we think need to happen here.

I take the opportunity to restate again that we are not opposed to a fund such as this. We acknowledge that the superannuation liability does need to be dealt with, and we acknowledge that paying surplus funds into a fund such as this is a good idea, but only when there are surplus funds. Just because we get a GST windfall does not necessarily mean there is a surplus, and obviously there is not if we are running a budget deficit.

I do not have a lot more to say. I am not going to labour the points on this, but I will reiterate my question again to the Treasurer because he did not take the opportunity to answer it when he got to his feet on that amendment: I want to know whether you have external expert advice and have done analysis about whether mandating the payment of 50 per cent of GST windfalls is a good idea and a good investment?

We know and we heard you mount a strong political defence for this bill in your response to our amendment. I did not hear anything technical in your response. I did not hear anything that justified why this is a good idea, why the arguments that I have put in relation to only doing this in years of cash surplus is wise, or why Saul Eslake is wrong. I did not hear you address any of those points. When you are summing up, I invite you to answer that question about external advice, about whether you have done modelling to ensure that this is the best pathway forward, and to respond to the concerns that we have raised.

We do not oppose a bill like this. It has merit, but it has to be right. We need to get it right, so I urge you to address those points specifically and not just launch into a political diatribe that attacks the Labor Party. We know that is the genesis of this bill. It comes from a media release three days out from the last election with the headline 'A Strong Plan to fix Labor's unfunded super liability'. We know the genesis of it - that does not mean it is wrong, but it is only right if you get it right, and that is our concern.

We will move those amendments that I have foreshadowed in my second reading to try to constrain this to only paying in 50 per cent of GST windfalls in those years of cash surplus. Thank you.

[12.50 p.m.]
Mr FERGUSON (Bass) - Honourable Deputy Speaker, I rise as Liberal member for Bass, naturally, but I have some experience, and I really want to show that support for the Treasurer's very good work that he has brought before the House today.
In the time between now and 1 p.m., I will address some of the points in the foregoing debate. I might come back to that, if time permits, at a later hour at 2:30 p.m.

I want to say from the outset that I am surprised by some of the contributions that have been made, particularly from the Greens. I believe the Labor Party has expressed a point of view today that shows me that even if there is some - and there is - disagreement on financial management - and I can say from the outset that the Labor Party does not have clean hands on financial management. Let that be on the record. However, they seem to get it.

In relation to this bill, there is a central reason why you might want to support it. It is not just about meeting, in a stronger and more capable way, the Tasmanian government's unfunded superannuation liability, which I believe is well canvassed and well understood. It is actually about building in stronger internal controls into our financial management legislation in Tasmania.

That is why the contribution that we have just heard from the member for Clark, Mr Bayley, on behalf of the Greens, surprises me, because it seems to me that if we would agree with the Greens' position on this bill, that in years where the budget is in cash deficit but there has been an extraordinary unexpected amount of GST that we have received, for whatever reason - we might come to that later - that he would prefer not to have a control on the government that it cannot spend it all. That really surprises me. Does it not surprise others? It really does surprise me.

Mr Bayley - There is not really that much control. It is smoke and mirrors.

Mr FERGUSON - I believe what I am doing here is exposing that this is, in fact, the very opposite of what you would normally expect from the Greens. They are very authoritarian in respect of accountability of executive government. They are doing the very opposite.

If we would agree with Mr Bayley, he is actually giving a leave pass, a permission slip to the government of the day - whether it is Liberal or Labor or something else - that you do not have the stricture, you do not have the controls. What the Treasurer has brought to the House today is really what you might have expected the Greens, the Labor Party and the crossbench to jump at, knowing full well that we have a significant unfunded super liability in Tasmania, that in years where the government receives more money than it expected from the federal GST collection process, that you tuck 50 per cent of that away, out of reach of the Treasurer, out of reach of this House.

I thought, instead, that perhaps the Greens or others might have been arguing over the 50 per cent. They are not. They are actually saying zero per cent should go into the superannuation liability fund in years where the budget is not in cash surplus. That really surprises me. What they are saying, therefore, is that if there were $200 million within-year GST windfall gain, that the treasurer has access to allocate all of it, including to additional spending.

What we as a government are saying - and it is based on our 2030 Strong Plan policy which has been well articulated by the Treasurer - is that we accept that the budget needs support; we accept and we want to see stronger, more contemporary financial controls. The late Tony Rundle got it, and were it the case that this kind of legislation had been put in place in those years, David Bartlett, the then premier, would not have been able to do as he said at the time, and I quote him, 'We are getting the hay out of the barn.' Who remembers that? Maybe not many. I do, and I remember it very well.

The superannuation provision account had a balance of about $1.5 billion in there because of the fact that it was accounted for. It was within arm's reach, not outside, within arm's reach of the government of the day and they did spend it. It is gone now. The balance was taken to zero and the line item in the budget papers removed, and now we are debating this legislation to reverse that, to start building up that nest egg of funds as a genuine control.

It is a financial control to put windfall gains, that is money that was not expected in the preceding budget, and take it away from the government's ability to use it or, I think to the Treasurer's point, future governments - a lock and key and a safeguard on those funds, because we do accept across the Chamber that we have an unfunded liability and it must be met. It is being met. That is one of the challenges that does face our budget.

I applaud the Deputy Premier and Treasurer for bringing forward this legislation and I will rest the point in relation to the Greens tactics here today. I acknowledge Mr Willie's on behalf of the Labor Party's sensible position to not demand that it be withdrawn and redrafted and, in anticipation of future debate perhaps on some of those amendments, I want those points to stand, because I do, as a Tasmanian, as a former treasurer, as a current Liberal member for Bass and as a future non-member of this parliament, but a committed Tasmanian, want these strong controls and we all ought to want those strong controls, and Tasmania, therefore, will be better off.

This is really not about us here and now. This is really about future generations. It is about young people, future taxpayers, because, if we do not address it with these kind of controls now and again build up - I would love to see another $1.5 billion in that fund in years to come. I would see that as a real achievement of this government and I would say an achievement of this parliament that we are part of. 

The GST is a contentious area from time to time, and one of the challenges with GST is it can be quite challenging or indeed notorious to predict it. The federal budget papers never line up with the state budget papers in relation to GST. Our Treasury officials, some of whom are represented in the advisers' area, are far better at forecasting Tasmania's GST receipts.

The federal government are the best at calculating and predicting the future pool, but our people know the relativities and the different factors that go into determining what our likely GST forecasts are going to be. Our Treasury will provide that at each budget, and depending on the timing of the two levels of government's budgets, there is a level of uncertainty around that. I strongly believe that if we have stronger financial controls, we will have a stronger budget. Although I have not seen it, I note that this morning the opposition tabled a bill, which I understood to be an amendment to the Charter of Budget Responsibility, and for whatever is in that bill - I have not read it yet - I look forward to that debate and I look forward to reading it.

If it is consistent with the Eslake report recommendations, I will find that really interesting, and no doubt the Treasurer will as well. We will examine that and possibly take further steps as a government to protect Tasmania's financial future. However, I find it so irritating that we had this fund in years past and it was spent. It would have been more honest for the government of that time to have made a decision about needing to spend further funds and to have nonetheless used the Specific Purpose Accounts (SPA) as an offset account against those borrowings.

I would have found it far more comforting for those funds to nonetheless have been protected and not just find their way into the reach of a government that actually, for its own purposes - yes, noting there was a Global Financial Crisis and a response needed - but actually spent all of it; $1.5 billion, which was at that time something around a quarter of the state budget. It is all gone and now we need to restore that buffer.

Sitting suspended from 1.00 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.


SUPERANNUATION LIABILITY (GST WINDFALL FUND)BILL 2025 (No 17)

Second Reading

Resumed from above.

[2.30 p.m.]
Mr FERGUSON (Bass) - Deputy Speaker, before the break I was explaining the benefits of the Treasurer's bill that he has brought to the House. It is a good bill. This is a good policy developed by the Liberal Party and taken to the last election. It helps clean up the mess of the superannuation liability that was an achievement of the Rundle government and spent by the Bartlett and Giddings government. This government will restore it with the support of this House.

The bill locks away 50 per cent of any unexpected GST windfalls. That is over and above what the budget would have anticipated. I have made the point about how it is a control on new expenditure. That money goes directly toward reducing the state's superannuation debt, and it cannot be touched for any other purposes other than dealing with that liability unless it is approved by both Houses of parliament.

I cannot think of one right now, but if there were an extraordinary event that should require the prudent use of those funds for a different purpose, it would require a lot of convincing by the government of the day through both Houses of parliament.

This is about discipline and fairness. I spoke before the break about how this bill is not for this crop of politicians; it is for the next one. It is for our kids. I would imagine that the fund that is created by this legislation would be with us for at least the next 15 years, possibly longer as the tail of that liability is eventually dealt with. This is about strengthening the state while strengthening the state's finances.

In the time remaining I want to deal briefly with Labor hypocrisy on budget management. Honestly, I am so surprised. I welcome scrutiny and I am pleased that there is interest, but this is from the Labor Party that outspent the Liberal Party at the election by about three to one. To make the hypocrisy so much worse, they published a so called 'costings paper', which I printed during the break, but I only printed pages 4 to 7 because I would have run out of red toner - I am not joking; that stuff is expensive - because there was so much red ink on the cover and front and back.
I therefore focused on what they were promising to deliver. They did not include their energy costings. That policy, at $400 per regulated customer per year for 255,000 power bill customers. That is around $100 million a year. It was not even provided to Treasury. I think that was their first policy. That is a $400-million policy at least, because they also gave a forward commitment that they would keep it to within 2.5 per cent per year. It is not even in this document that I am holding in my hand. 

The cost-of-living support ranged between $18 and $41 million per year, a long way short of the $100 million for their energy bill rebate promise. It does beg the question: were they serious about that promise? I would argue no, they were not. It was a candy promise.

We have the opposition today attempting to claim clean hands on budget and fiscal management. They cannot, and that is not even to score the obvious points about the error-riddled document that was released two days before the election on 21 March. The numbers did not add up.

To make it worse again - yes, it does get worse, Deputy Speaker - Labor was promising cuts. They were promising to deliver a $3 million surplus in 2026-27. I suppose you can do that if you do not include your new expenditure, and book about $2.2 billion in budget cuts, unspecified, except for a few infrastructure projects, which they singled out. 

Mr Willie - That was made up by someone in your office. I know that for a fact.

Mr FERGUSON - I am holding it in my hand, Mr Willie. I am surprised that you are speaking up. I have the numbers in front of me. Your savings and offsets in 2023-24, not from my office, but from Dr Broad's, are $135 million. In 2024-25, $243 million; in 2025-26, $260 million; in 2026-27, it rises to $316 million. That is from the Labor Party document, not my office. That adds up to $954 million in OpEx savings. It seems the Labor Party does not know its own history. 

On the capital page, I will not go through the years wasting time, but $1.138 billion in capital cuts. That brings me to $2.1 billion of cuts - an artificial, pretend surplus. You are having Tasmanians on. No wonder you got pilloried at the time, and deservedly so. 

One thing we might be able to agree on is that our budget is under pressure, and with the exception of Western Australia, every state and territory budget is under significant pressure. That brings me to the work on the GST itself. In the time remaining, I want to focus on that point because we as a state stand together on the GST - and we ought to - and it disappoints me, and it has caused me regret, that our House was not united on some of these key principles.

We have seen wasting of time and pointless point scoring, if I can put it that way, on the GST 'no worse off' guarantee. This House should have stood united - Liberal and Labor, shoulder to shoulder on the 'no worse off' guarantee. 

Dr Broad - You signed up to it.

Mr FERGUSON - Not blaming Scomo, not blaming Chris Bowen -

Dr Broad - What about Peter Gutwein?

Mr FERGUSON - Not blaming Peter Gutwein, not saying stupid things like, 'You agreed to it'.

Dr Broad - You did.

Mr FERGUSON - I will say it again: not saying stupid things like, 'We agreed to it'.

Dr Broad - You did.

Mr FERGUSON - You are just saying stupid things, because the Tasmanian Liberal government did not agree to it.

Dr Broad - Oh, no Liberal signature on that at all.

Mr FERGUSON - That is where you are wrong. You do not know your own history. The policy was proposed by Chris Bowen, the shadow treasurer. It was adopted by the Morrison government. It was something that every state and territory could not change, could not object to, could not agree with. It was a decision of the Australian Parliament. What we did agree on is the need for the 'no worse off' guarantee. Maybe now Labor might get up to date with its own history. That is my clear understanding. 

I want to say something else about the GST. We could have done a better job of standing together on the GST exemption for Macquarie Point.

Dr Broad - That you forgot about.

Mr FERGUSON - Again we hear these foolish comments. Tasmania got that GST exemption. I vowed, on a freezing cold day on the Midland Highway, standing next to the former federal member for Lyons, that we would get it, and I had to suffer listening to a Labor MP arguing with the media about why Tasmania did not have a legitimate case. We did. It was a legitimate case and we got it. This government got it and congratulations to Senator Tammy Tyrrell for helping us in the Senate. She deserves a lot of credit and I congratulate her for her work.

We could have got it without Senator Tyrrell if our House had been more united and I would wish, if the state is confronted with a similar problem in the future, that we could be united, arguing for our state's interests. Cast your mind back, given the debate, given the pointless political comments that get made, given that the exemption was refused for over one year, we had to wait for a year to get the refusal, given that we said at the time there are three more budget updates where we could get it, so we are not going to give up, given that people told me, 'Fergo, do give up, you are probably wasting your time, do not invest too much in this.' I said 'No, we will keep fighting for it.'

One of those people came to me that day and said, 'Well done, you are right, good fighting for that,' but given that it has now been granted, does anybody feel satisfied that it was worth the petty point-scoring in this House? It was not, and I would hope that if a similar thing would happen in the future, our House could be more grown up, more focused on the needs of our state and stand up to Canberra when required, whether it is a Liberal federal government or a Labor federal government and they change.

Congratulations to the Treasurer for this bill. It is good policy. It sounds like the amendments being proposed by the Greens are not attractive. I would not imagine that there is a lot of interest in that, but I think it is good that this legislation will protect our state's financial security and I congratulate the Treasurer.

[2.40 p.m.]
Mrs BESWICK (Braddon) - Deputy Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Superannuation Liability (GST Windfall Fund) Bill 2025. This is a sensible, timely and welcome initiative that recognises one of our most pressing financial challenges facing our state: the growing cost of unfunded superannuation for former State Service employees. It is a challenge that has been known for decades and yet one that has too often has been pushed to the side in favour of more immediate short-term concerns.

We all understand the principle of superannuation. Our public servants, especially those who work under the older defined benefit schemes, contributed over many years with the understanding that the state would meet its share of the obligation when they retired, and for a long time, Tasmania had a dedicated pool of funds set aside to meet those future obligations. It was a responsible intergenerational approach, one that gave certainty to workers and provided stability to the budget, but that dedicated pool no longer exists.

Over successive governments, that money was drawn down, redirected or spent and now we face the consequences. We are effectively paying for pensions out of today's operating budget as though these retired employees were still on the payroll. That means every year, for the next 20 to 30 years, we will be allocating a significant and growing portion of our budget to meet these past obligations, money that cannot be spent on hospitals, schools, housing or infrastructure.

This bill recognises that we must do something. It proposes a simple but effective step. When Tasmania receives more GST revenue than expected in a financial year, half of that windfall will be placed into a special purpose fund. That fund, tightly restricted in its use, will go solely towards paying down our unfunded super liability. It is, in effect, a way to catch up, to begin restoring what was once set aside for this purpose, to reduce the pressure on future budgets.

This approach is targeted, prudent and responsible. It does not take money away from essential services. It does not impose new taxes or increase debt. It simply says that when we get more than we planned for, we will not spend it all. We will use a portion to honour past commitments and secure our long-term financial position.

I want to take a moment to commend the Treasurer for embedding safeguards in this legislation. The money in the Superannuation Liability Fund cannot be used for general spending. It cannot be redirected for political purposes. If any government wants to access those funds for something else, they must come back to this parliament and get the approval of both Houses. That is how it should be. It gives Tasmanians confidence that the fund will do what it is meant to do. It also sends a signal to credit rating agencies, investors and future governments that we are looking at our long-term liabilities seriously.

While I support this bill fully, I do think it raises an important question: if we agree this is the right use of a GST windfall, why not commit? Why commit only half? I understand the desire to retain flexibility. Every year brings its own budget pressures and its own priorities. In a state like ours with a superannuation liability this large and growing, I believe there is a case for going further.

When we receive unexpected income, money we were not planning for, perhaps the most responsible action is to commit all of it to reducing future obligations. By using 100 per cent of GST windfalls for this purpose, we could reduce our liabilities faster, reduce interest and long-term costs, and free up more space in future budgets. That is not about austerity, that is about setting ourselves up to do more, not less, in the years ahead. We know that these superannuation payments will peak in the years to come. We know they will have a heavy burden on our budget for decades. This legislation gives us a tool to manage that burden.

This bill also restores something that has been missing from our public finances for too long: discipline. It reintroduces the principle that when you make a commitment, you plan ahead to meet it. When you owe money, you do not just wait until the bill arrives. You save. You set funds aside. You show respect for the public servants who earn their entitlements and for the future Tasmanians who will have to pay the bills we do not.

That is why this bill matters. It is not just a financial measure, it is a moral one. It is about intergenerational fairness. It is about building public trust. It is about showing that this parliament is capable of not just managing the present, but preparing for the future.

I hope that future governments will build on this framework. Perhaps they will consider increasing the contribution beyond 50 per cent. Perhaps they will direct other windfalls or surpluses into the fund. Perhaps they will treat it as a model for other long-term challenges but for now, this bill is a good start. It is well-designed, it is property-targeted, and it shows that we can still do serious non-partisan work on the big issues that matter.

Mr Willie - It is highly partisan.

Mrs BESWICK - No, it is not. I like this bill. I am going to make some more points because you have brought me out.

It is a little piece of our puzzle that we need to put our budget back together. It is a tiny piece. It is not going to make a massive difference. It is only going to be a few million here and a few million there, but it will make a little difference.

I have experience where the people who operate the RBF can be incredibly difficult to work with. They just hold onto that money as hard as they can. We need to make that a better system and look after our elderly better in that way. I think the fact that they have so little to work with is part of that culture. We need to be thinking ahead and thinking how we are going to fix this problem. We have other ways and means of doing that, but this is a really good start.

Thank you, Treasurer.

[2.47 p.m.]
Mr JAENSCH (Braddon - Minister for Finance) - Deputy Speaker, I thank the Treasurer for bringing this bill. It is a sensible, strategic long-term part of our toolkit for rebuilding the state's finances after the challenges of the last few years, including the unanticipated but essential investment made during the COVID period: the rebuilding and the stimulation of our economy that was needed, keeping people safe, keeping businesses alive, and keeping people in their jobs. Our state has emerged strongly and our economy is as strong as ever; unexpectedly strong compared to the forecasts and the more dire predictions that we saw through the depths of COVID. I congratulate our Treasurer and his predecessors on the investments that have been made and the hard work ahead of us to fill that hole in our state's finances and keep our keep our state's economy strong so that we can undertake longer-term budget repair and return to surplus. I want to thank Mrs Beswick as well. Not to stop her having a conversation, but just for her thoughtful personal reflection on this. She gets it. She knows what we are doing here.

She is prepared to work collegially in this place on our joint responsibility as parliamentarians, so I thank her for her contribution as well and her support for the bill. I rise in support of this very responsible policy that we took to the last election as part of our government's 2030 Strong Plan for Tasmania's Future.

The bill demonstrates the commitment of this government to making courageous and responsible decisions that demonstrate appropriate long-term planning in action. The bill will deliver on our commitment to introduce a law to require the use of a proportion of future GST windfalls to be set aside to pay down Labor's unfunded superannuation liability. This is a liability that costs Tasmanians more than $350 million a year. Context for this cost is important. According to the Treasurer's annual financial report 2023-24, when looking at expenditure by function, $264.1 million was spent on police services over the 2023-24 financial year, significantly less than $350 million. This comparison serves to demonstrate this cost is a huge amount; a cost that is projected to rise to almost $500 million by 2035. Labor is the master of revisionism. They keep saying the incoming Liberal government in 2014 - 

Mr Willie - Deputy Speaker.

Deputy SPEAKER - Is that a point of order, Mr Willie? 

Mr Willie - No. I would like to call your attention to the state of the House. 

Quorum formed. 

Mr JAENSCH - Thank you, Deputy Speaker. As I was saying, Labor is the master of revisionism. They keep saying that the incoming Liberal Government in 2014 inherited no debt. That is not true. It is there in black and white in the 2013-14 Labor-Greens' budget papers:

It is estimated that net debt will be $226.1 million as at 30 June 2014 and will increase in 2015. 

Then the Reimbursement Expense Receipt (RER) in 2014 and in the risks report, which we requested Treasury to prepare after we took over the budget we were left with, showed net debt was not zero but was pushing almost half a billion dollars, over $400 million in 2016-17. Not only that, they left the state with $1.5 billion in an unfunded superannuation liability. The reality is that Labor raided the superannuation provision account and charted themselves a pathway for the state to significant debt. They made the debt worse and let the Liberals take over.

Today we are asking this parliament to support fiscal sustainability and intergenerational fairness through the support of this bill. It is incumbent on this parliament to ensure fiscal sustainability for the long-term prosperity of our state. However, such fiscal sustainability can only be achieved through an accumulation of responsible decisions, such as through supporting this bill.

As observed in the Tasmanian Government Fiscal Sustainability Report 2021:

Early action to correct fiscal deterioration will mitigate the severity of the measures required to effectively maintain fiscal sustainability, and any action to maintain fiscal sustainability must recognise and address major drivers of a deterioration in the budget position.

This bill heeds those words by putting the consideration of future generations at its forefront, and I am proud to be part of a government and a team with vision and forward plans as well as being able to deal with the issues of today.

I do contrast this with the somewhat cheap point-scoring tactics played by those opposite in question time just yesterday. After a week, and after - I have to say - a growing trend over recent months in this term of government for the Leader of the Opposition to get up and start his Question Time with questions to the Premier and generally stay on the Premier for the rest of the day with matters of significance in his mind targeting the Premier. Yesterday he asked his first couple of questions of me.

I am very honoured to be asked, and I am very happy to answer questions in my portfolio area. That is what I prepare for every day. I come to here, to the media - to the main street of Wynyard, Goldie Street, where I live - prepared to answer questions on what I do in the parliament and what my responsibilities are, particularly as minister. However, I have never had a first question in a Question Time from the Leader of the Opposition.

Now, we did explore this a little today in Question Time and why Mr Winter may not have wanted to give the Premier an opportunity to revisit some of his discoveries about Mr Winter's truthfulness, or lack thereof, in the past. He clearly wanted to avoid creating another opportunity for that, but he was going to get the first question, so he had to direct it somewhere else.

At first, I thought that he actually meant to ask me a question about my area of responsibilities for finance and long-term strategies for our own-source revenue with land tax and stamp duty. He brandished the letter, which is available on the public record, where the Premier makes a point of commissioning me with some priorities. I am very happy to meet them and to be held accountable for them, and so I was sort of preparing myself for a discussion in the parliament with the opposition about our strategy for the state's finances for the future.

I thought, 'That is good. That is what I am here for. I am here to have those discussions, to share insights, to listen to ideas, to hear what the opposition would do.' This place should be a contest of ideas. I think our constituents all expect us to be here seeing what they see, seeing how the state's challenges are being addressed by all the people in this parliament working together.

I thought we had turned a bit of a corner, because the first question of the day was on something that I knew was an issue that we have to address, and it landed in my court and I got a question from the Leader of the Opposition on that. I thought, 'Right, it's on. We are here solving problems for Tasmania.'
It became pretty quickly evident, though, that this was the setup for the Leader of the Opposition to then drop this line asserting that the government was going to put a new tax on the family homes of Tasmanians, their principal place of residence. He asked that question.

I do not think he ever thought that we were doing that. He did not refer to Saul Eslake's report where he talks about our future strategies for state own-source revenue and targets, and things like that. He did not refer to strategies that have been taken by other states to change the mix of their own revenue streams. He just wanted to get this line out that maybe the Liberal government was going to tax people's homes at a time when a lot of people are really struggling to pay their mortgages and bills.

What might have started out as a little bit of an evasive tactic to avoid the Premier embarrassing him, became something quite unnecessary and ill-informed and possibly even irresponsible. If it took off that Tasmanians listening or reporting on what happened in here seriously thought that there were moves afoot to tax people's homes in the current cost-of-living environment, that could really upset some people. It could have caused them deep concern, and not because Mr Winter had any inkling that we might be doing that, that there was any evidence or suggestion, or that anyone had suggested, that we might be introducing a land tax on the family home, but because he needed to get away from an embarrassing question or two himself. I thought that was a remarkably reckless way to spend the parliament's time that morning.

Members interjecting.

Mr JAENSCH - I am trying to work out what the Leader of the Opposition is doing. Once he laid that out, I became quite angry at him. I thought that was an irresponsible thing to do as a stunt in his place, and unnecessary. I will watch what he does and I will listen to Mr Willie laughing while I speak about this.

Mr Willie - I was laughing at you running down the clock.

Mr Ferguson - This is serious.

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY SPEAKER - Members on my left.

Mr JAENSCH - You do not know how that might have affected some people. I think it was a cheap shot.

On the other hand, what this Treasurer is doing, what this government is doing, what our side is doing is getting on with the serious job of governing, thinking for the long term, solving some problems that we inherited, and doing it in a responsible way.

This bill will establish a specific purpose account, the Superannuation Liability Fund, to be provided through section 17 of the Financial Management Act 2016 and for specification of the purpose for which the account is to be used. The Superannuation Liability Fund will only be used to offset the unfunded superannuation liability of the general government sector for retirement benefit fund contributory scheme members and pensioners. In effect, this will impose an ongoing budget discipline on governments to ensure state budgets are balanced, while also ensuring greater provisions for this liability are made in the near-term by this generation and not leave this obligation to just fall to the people who are young Tasmanians today.

It is a reality that Tasmania is burdened by a massive unfunded superannuation liability. It is the largest liability of the general government sector. This is indisputable and the time for action is now. The impact of this legislation will be to reduce debt-servicing costs for this liability, whilst also reducing the impact of the liability on future government's ability to respond to unforeseen events.

Unforeseen challenges are a fact of life. Providing for future financial flexibility for this state - I would point to the impact of COVID-19, as I mentioned before - and implementing recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into the Tasmanian Government's Responses to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings, acting to respond to the state's unfunded superannuation liability now reduces the impact of this burden on future generations if left unaddressed.

If those opposite were concerned about contributing to safeguarding the state's finances, they would join us in lobbying the Albanese government, to quarantine the funding for Macquarie Point from GST distribution calculations. Mr Albanese promised Tasmanians he would commit $240 million to this iconic project, and now that state Labor has finally recognised the economic benefits, if Mr Winter and the shadow treasurer would like to personally contribute to the state's finances, I encourage those opposite to get on board with these efforts as well.

Our government has been relentlessly lobbying the federal government regarding GST distributions. On 6 December 2023, the federal government announced a three-year extension to the 'no worse off' guarantee from 2026-27 until 2029-30. This outcome is a result of Tasmanian advocacy on the national stage, and this represents a good step forward for securing funding for Tasmanians. Without it, Tasmania would be $267 million worse off.

Whilst this outcome ensures we do not lose hundreds of millions in GST distributions to Tasmania in the short term, we will not stop in our pursuit of a permanent and ongoing agreement to ensure that we always receive our fair share in the future. We have been determined in our pursuit of the federal government over this matter. The GST 'no worse off' guarantee payments are critical to Tasmania's finances. Funding received through the 'no worse off' guarantee is critical to enabling us to invest more into the things that Tasmanians care about most like health and education, housing and community infrastructure.

The Tasmanian Government has continually argued the risks of the new arrangements are ongoing and the guarantee should be a permanent arrangement. The massive budget surplus being enjoyed by the Western Australian government is exactly why we opposed the changes to GST distribution and why we argued strongly for, and secured, the 'no worse off' guarantee in the first place. Last year's Queensland budget forecasts show that Queensland could also benefit from the double bonanza of booming royalties and increased GST revenue next financial year.

We do not believe this is fair, and neither should Labor accept that it is fair. All state and territory treasuries have jointly written to the Australian Treasurer, Dr Jim Chalmers, advocating for a permanent extension of the 'no worse off' guarantee, and we will continue to work with the federal government to ensure Tasmania's fair share of national revenues continues.

This is a bill that goes directly to the legacy that we leave to the next generation of Tasmanians. I ask the House to support this important action to support fiscal sustainability and intergenerational fairness. I think it is a mark of this Treasurer and this government that, at a time when we are emerging from COVID, with the task ahead of us to rebuild the state's finances, to keep the economy strong, to deliver on the 191 recommendations of the commission of inquiry, to make provision for the generations of people who were wronged by the structures and the institution of the state in the past as found through the commission of inquiry - in amongst all of those challenges, our government and our Treasurer, through this bill, are also thinking for future generations. 

The government is finding a mechanism to ensure that we are dealing with one of those inherited burdens on our state's finances in the superannuation liability and making provision to ensure that whomever occupies these benches in the future, including our descendants, the people who replace us here, has a mechanism in place to ensure that they can meet those obligations that were passed down to them.

I encourage the House to support the bill.

[3.07 p.m.]
Mr BEHRAKIS (Clark) - Deputy Speaker, I also speak in support of this bill. A few things have been said that need to be touched on. There was a bit of discussion earlier between Mrs Beswick and Mr Willie about whether this bill was political or not, and I think there are two things that need to be separated here. One is the bill itself, and then the other is how we got to talking about it today.

I think the bill itself is, and it has been acknowledged by others to be as well, a responsible bill. It is establishing mechanisms to help pay down that superannuation liability. There were talks about the flexibility and the use of that GST windfall, and I think that 50 per cent, as Mrs Beswick said, gives that requirement to ensure that we are paying down that liability as well as keeping that flexibility for us to be able to use that money as Tasmanians need. 

The bill is restricting the use of that money to the fund whereby it may only be transferred to the retirement benefits fund to be applied to the unfunded superannuation liability. It is a responsible and important bill, and we all obviously support that. 

Let us talk about responsibility and let us talk about reform. Let us talk about results and about why Tasmania cannot afford another Labor government, because that is the reason why we are here debating this bill today. Tasmania, at the moment, is burdened by a massive unfunded superannuation liability - a liability that was created by past Labor governments, which raided that money that was set aside to pay for them.

We hear on a regular basis from Mr Willie, the supposed alternative treasurer, about how the last Labor-Greens government left us with cash in the bank. That is because they raided $1.5 billion out of the superannuation account. Because of that recklessness, Tasmania now spends more than $350 million every year on superannuation payments, with that number only set to continue to increase. That figure is set to increase to almost $500 million by 2035. That is sheer recklessness, and it is why Tasmanians cannot afford another Labor government. We are cleaning up Labor's mess, cleaning up the mess that they left - not only with regard to this, but in a lot of ways.

This bill is going to lock away 50 per cent of any unexpected GST windfalls. It will ensure that that money goes towards reducing that superannuation debt and that it cannot be used for anything else unless approved by both Houses of parliament. This is about discipline; it is about intergenerational fairness. It ensures that Labor's mess is not passed on to our kids and grandkids.

At the moment, regardless of the relentless negativity that we hear from the other side, Tasmania is leading the nation in economic growth. State final demand is up three per cent, retail trade and exports are at record highs and wages are growing faster than the national average. Contrast that with a recessionary economy and unemployment rate that were twice what they are now back when that disastrous Labor government sat on our side of the House.

In 11 years - and we have spoken about this quite a bit - the Labor Party have not been able to deliver any sort of alternative about how they would run this state. There has been no alternative budget, even though they have been called on to deliver one not once but twice now. We will see whether or not they finally show some respect for the will of the House. 

Mr Willie calls it a stunt, but it is important, especially in the context of this bill, because if Labor could be trusted on economic policy, we would not need to be debating this bill to clean up and pay back the superannuation liabilities that they left when they were in government. They need to front up to this place and front up to the Tasmanian people. When they make promises about all the things that they would fund or implement, they have to say how they plan on paying for it. Where is that money going to come from? Are they going to raise taxes, or are they going to find another fund somewhere else that they can raid to pay for their promises?

On the flip side, let us be clear: the Tasmanian Liberal government has a real plan to return to surplus by 2029-30. In the meantime, what does Labor do? They continue to criticise our budget, but they refuse to release one of their own. They refuse to put their own policies up for scrutiny. They celebrate the decade of federal debt. They have no costed policies, no alternative plan, just empty attacks and press releases.

We will not be lectured to by a party that left this state with a whopping superannuation liability and still will not take responsibility for it. Back then, Tasmania had the worst business confidence in the nation. Businesses said government was working against them. They have proven time and again that they cannot be trusted.

What is their plan? How will they pay for things? Who knows. It is inevitably going to be more tax. They exposed themselves in the last session of parliament when they voted to legislate higher own-source revenue targets. 

We will return to surplus, and we will do it in a responsible way. We will do it in the way that Tasmanians expect us to, not by raising taxes and certainly not by continuing to raid funds and raid money like the superannuation liability.

Mr Willie - There is nothing left. You have spent it.

Mr BEHRAKIS - You raided it. We are going to pay it down, we are going to show that responsibility. We are going to pay back that intergenerational liability that your party left, Mr Willie. Your party left that. We should let Mr Willie explain to Tasmanians how those policies, how raiding the superannuation fund, how increasing taxes for Tasmanians is any sort of fiscal discipline.

Mr Willie - What about $9.6 billion worth of debt?

Mr BEHRAKIS - What about their $4 billion election con, Deputy Speaker? They had $2 billion in phantom cuts and they had 11 corrections to their election costings a day after they put them out. Where are they going to find this money that they are proposing to cut from spending? Are they going to pull it out of another fund? Are they going to find some other people's money that they can draw from. 

They continue to deflect, they continue to talk down the state and they continue to be completely irresponsible with the state's funds whenever they have any chance to get a hold of them. That is the reason why we are here today debating this bill. It is an important bill, it is a responsible bill and it is a bill that is, as I said, paying back that intergenerational debt and liability that was left by the last Labor government.

We will continue to do those things, we will continue to do what Tasmanians need us to do to be responsible and to build our economy at the same time and that is what it means to govern with a plan. We are doing that while continuing to back infrastructure investment, continuing to invest in things like the Bridgewater bridge, like the new K Block at the Royal Hobart Hospital, like Midlands Highway upgrade and rail and irrigation upgrades and all the other things that we are investing in for future generations, whilst also paying down this generational liability that Labor left us.

Let us be completely clear: Labor created this liability. They have walked away from all sorts of things, including fair infrastructure funding. They have no plan. They have plenty and plenty of press releases and hype that they are hoping the Tasmanian public will buy into, but we have a plan to pay back that unfunded liability, we have a plan to grow the economy, we are continuing to deliver infrastructure and planning with a return to surplus, and we are doing that without raising taxes and without raiding the cookie tin.

That is the difference. That is the choice that Tasmanians have and that is why only the Liberals can be trusted to responsibly manage this state and to secure Tasmania's future, and I commend this bill to the House.

Mr Willie - More filibustering.

Mr Bayley - Only one bill left and they do not want to talk about it.

[3.16 p.m.]
Mr ELLIS (Braddon - Minister for Housing, Planning and Consumer Affairs) - Deputy Speaker, look, we are keen, but interestingly enough, it sounds like you guys are the ones who are trying to push that one off, which is an interesting interjection from you, Mr Bayley, and I think trying to politicise that bill is a very big mistake.

As far as this particular bill, it is also important for the future of our children and, as a Liberal government, we are very conscious of the need to ensure that we back in the next generation of Tasmanians whether that is through ensuring that there are great educational opportunities for people while they are young right now, or intergenerational infrastructure that we build so that they have safe roads, bridges that give them more access, massive infrastructure investment in social services, things like hospitals and police stations, opportunities for young Tasmanians right around this state for generations to come because of the investments that we make here today.

Indeed, every time I cross the Bridgewater bridge, I think that that is such a monument to the ambitions of the Tasmanian people and our belief that the work that we can do here today in this place, in government, for our young people by building those things is really such a key part of the legacy that we should all hope to leave and, of course, the other key area where it is important that we support future generations is by ensuring fiscal sustainability and that the obligations that we have to previous generations of Tasmanians are borne as well as we can in this generation and to support future ones.

That is exactly why this GST windfall legislation is so important. There are currently public servants who have retired who are receiving payments who retired before many of the taxpayers of Tasmania were born. Let me say that again. There are people today who are receiving payments who retired and were no longer providing services to the public before taxpayers of today were born. Those young people who are coming through, who are buying a house, who are paying stamp duty, who are paying other fees and charges that come with the ordinary part of Tasmanian life, perhaps starting a business and even over time paying payroll tax, and certainly their employees paying payroll tax on their labour, those young people should as best as we possibly can be handed a future where some of the obligations of the past are supported.

The superannuation liability came about because a Labor government decided that they should take the hay out of the barn, but the problem was that they did not just take the hay out of the barn, they burnt the barn down. They left nothing there to pay for those obligations, for those hardworking public servants who provided services during their time and which we are committed to supporting into the future. It was important at that time though - the foresight of Tony Rundle and those Liberal governments - to set up the support to pay for the superannuation liability of the public servants of that day. Those funds should never have been taken away and spent for the short-term interests of the time. They should have been left there so that the funds could grow and grow and grow. 

With compound interest, we know that a dollar invested yesterday will be worth more tomorrow. It was so important and so farsighted to take on the obligations of the past in that day to ensure that future generations were not saddled with it. So, our Treasurer and our team at the last election put together the 2030 Strong Plan, a plan that put to the Tasmanian people that we had a vision for the future, that over the course of the next six years that we would continue to set up our state to build the intergenerational infrastructure that we needed for the future, to provide the educational and health services so that our young people can flourish and thrive and, importantly, to bring forward this legislation so that where we have windfall gains that come through, particularly with the GST allocations as they are predicted by Treasury, that a portion of those funds be put forward into an account to help pay for the future, because the decision that the Labor government made at the time is costing everyday Tasmanian taxpayers now; many of whom, as I mentioned, were born after many of these public servants retired. Those people are having to pay nearly $400 million every year to service those obligations. Now that is, of course, an obligation which we are proud to pay, but which we should have provided for at the time.

Even worse, it was provided for at the time under a Liberal government, and due to the reckless fiscal irresponsibility of that Labor government, they took all of the hay out of the barn. They said, 'nothing for the future'. It is effectively one of the largest exercises in intergenerational theft and probably 'superannuation theft' that you could think of - $1.5 billion that should have been paying for those people's super. What did they do? They blew it. They took the hay out of the barn. 

Compare the vision and the foresight of the Tony Rundle government that looked to pay their obligations out into the future and this government, which is investing in intergenerational infrastructure that will be used by Tasmanians for decades and decades to come. That is new houses, hospitals, bridges and roads. Compare that to the rank intergenerational theft of that former Labor government, that was compounded by their dodgy deal with the Greens, where all fiscal responsibility simply went out the window. They somehow managed to put Tasmania into recession, destroy 10,000 jobs, virtually shut down the forestry industry, and yet were still sacking people in the process. They sacked a nurse a day for nine months, 108 first responders kicked to the kerb, and tried to close 20 schools. The rank fiscal incompetence of the Labor government, followed by the Labor-Greens government, is something for which we are literally still having to pay for today - nearly $400 million each and every year, with none of the benefits that we would have accrued with compounding interests over the many years since the Rundle government and that Liberal government worked to put aside money for the future to pay for the obligations of the past.

At some stage, a government needs to act. Here we are today. We are acting. I commend the Treasurer for his work. I commend our team for taking this bold policy vision to the last election. The Tasmanian people have endorsed that, and the sense I get from many everyday Tasmanians - certainly, it is something that I mentioned in my first speech - is I believe that it is the wish of every generation that their next generation should live better than they did, and a big part of making sure that you can do that is that you invest for the future and that you save.

This act we are bringing forward looks to a particular mechanism through the allocation of GST as a particularly attractive way in which we can do that. This is money that we were not expecting to receive based on Treasury forecasts. With the change we see through complex calculations of the GST, 50 per cent of those windfalls will then automatically be directed into the lockdown fund to pay for Labor's unfunded superannuation liabilities. That just makes sense.

I believe most people understand that when windfalls come in, when unexpected financial gains are made, that is a really prudent time to be investing for the future and to be saving, because obligations that we have to the present day continue: paying for our police, our firefighters, our nurses, our teachers, and a whole range of others - paying for the commitments that we made at elections and to our communities. When additional funds come through, let us save that for a rainy day. We know that the rainy days of the future that come with our increased obligations to pay for the retirements of public servants is a significant wave of financial obligation coming through to our taxpayers, both now and into the future.

I mentioned nearly $400 million, a number that is projected to grow as people retire. That obligation needs to be met. Those people worked bloody hard while in the public service, and it was understood that the state would pay a pension to look after those people. In speaking with retired police officers at their retirement - I probably should not call them 'ceremonies' - 'parties' that we have from time to time, many of those people are on some of the defined benefits schemes. That is the nature of the work and the contracts in which they signed up to. That was the deal, but those people are retiring now.

It should be the taxpayers as close as possible to the time of their work who pay for the obligations of the future, because the other thing that we need to remember is that younger members of our community are not just paying for some of those obligations - the nearly $400 million of the retirement of public servants past - but they also paying for their own retirements. 

We are in that sandwich generation or generations who need to pay forward into their own superannuation accounts, looking forward decades into the future so that they can provide for their own retirements and their own old age. As our ageing population comes through, we know that we need to be making contributions now because of our demographics in this country and in the Western world. We cannot put that obligation onto generations in the future because of the scale of the ageing that is happening. It is incumbent upon us to make those bold calls.

I can congratulate a previous Labor government, under Paul Keating, with the vision to set up our superannuation system so that people can make a contribution to the future. The sad thing is when you contrast the Keating government that had a vision with the Tasmanian Labor Government that simply raided it for the present moment - that simply stole from the future so that they could live better in that day, and I believe, if they were really honest with us, so they could solve some of the political challenges that they were having at that time, where they wanted to spend more money than they had.

We will be backing in this legislation. It is an opportunity to lock in some fiscal discipline, not just now but right into the future. It will deliver certainty and I know that the Treasurer spoke about the extra revenue being used to strengthen the state's balance sheet. We have seen in other jurisdictions, including the federal government, farsighted governments of different colours make the decision to set up these kinds of special-purpose funds or accounts. The Future Fund is a classic example, delivered under a Liberal national government, by one of our great leaders, John Howard, and one of our great treasurers, Peter Costello. They had that farsighted vision, seeing a similar challenge coming through in those moments, the need to help to pay for Commonwealth public servants who served just as ours did in Tasmania and say, 'Let's lock that down for this period of time. Let's ensure that it is released so that the decisions that we make today help to pay for the future rather than rob from it.'

I know that there have been discussions from time to time among federal Labor members of parliament about what the opportunities of raiding the Future Fund might look like. I think it is good that in our country we acknowledge the importance of helping to pay for the future with the decisions of today. It will be an important fiscal discipline that we can continue to work through. I posit to this House that this should be a sacred pool of money and we need to recognise the critical mistake that the former Labor government made when it raided all the hay from the barn and burnt down the barn.

It should be taboo to be raiding this fund because this is the fund that is the retirement funds for hardworking public servants. It would be an act of superannuation theft, but it also puts that obligation upon taxpayers further and further out into the future to pay for the obligations to public servants whose careers were further and further into the past. It is a decisive measure and it is also one that gets the balance right.

This is a focus on windfall gains so that we can continue to invest in the future, but where additional income comes in, we are able to put it aside for the future in a prudent manner. What we saw on the other side during the last election campaign was absolute chaos when it came to managing our finances. How can a political party that hopes to win government at once promise $4 billion of extra spending - that is nearly $3 of spending compared to every $1 that the Liberal government proposed in that campaign - and then yet, at the same time, propose $2 billion worth of cuts?

We still do not know exactly what those cuts are, but we know that whenever Labor run out of money, which they do on a regular basis, they come after yours. They look for the cheap hit and that is higher taxes, that is greater government charges from our GBEs and also, one of the most shameful things that they do is they have mass sackings of hardworking public servants; a nurse a day for nine months, 108 police officers, the list goes on and on. In that $2 billion worth of cuts, we have an opposition who have complained about modest efficiency dividends, of which the scale does not even compare to the $2 billion worth of cuts that they propose.

Right across government, we would have seen a decimation of critical public servants. We would have seen a decimation of the people who served our state with such distinction in so many ways and that would have been to pay for the profligate, wild spending that we saw from the opposition. The Leader of Opposition was, at the time, the shadow for finance and was heavily involved in the crafting of what was perhaps one of the most bizarre and disastrous campaigns when it comes to cooking the books that any state opposition has been able to cobble together. There is a reason why Dr Broad is no longer the shadow treasurer. There is certainly a reason why he is not the real treasurer. They had to rewrite their policy - what was it? It was 11 times or something like that.

Mr Barnett - Eleven times.

Mr ELLIS - Imagine rewriting your fiscal policy 11 times. These are the people who are trying to run the state. While poor old Dr Broad got sacked and things went backwards for him, his understudy, the shadow for finance, was able to leapfrog his way into the leadership and then delete all of the policies that they took to that election. They have simply removed everything from the website, so the public do not know what the $2 billion worth of cuts were going to be. They cannot see what those $2 billion worth of cuts would be in the last alternative budget because there was not one. That was at the end of a very long line of a lack of alternative budgets.

I hear from the shadow treasurer what sounds to me to be a commitment that again they will not do an alternative budget. I have to say, if you want to be the alternative government, you need to have an alternative budget. The way that you spend your time and your money is an indication of your priorities. If you will not tell anyone the way that you will spend your money, then they do not think that you prioritise anything. That is why you have been on the opposition benches for 10 years. 
Mr Willie - It might be good material in a few years' time.

Mr ELLIS - That is why your own party would not let you govern. It is not just that the Tasmanian people did not trust you to govern. It is that the Labor Party did not trust the Labor Party to govern. That is on record. That is simply stating the facts.

We see the shameful flip-flopping that comes into this place - questions about the debt that we are bringing forward through intergenerational infrastructure, yet at the same time suggestions that we should spend more money. This is an opposition that is completely at sea, that failed to learn the lessons of the last election, where they brought one of the most incomprehensible, bizarre, hypocritical and failed economic policies that we have seen for many years, yet refuse to learn anything. It is not that hard to be consistent, but it takes, at least, the courage of your convictions. I think Mr Winter, as the Leader of the Opposition, has shown that he is not a man of conviction. He cannot even tell us where he was born. The flip-flopping that we have seen from the other side of politics about their economic policies has been truly on display.

I commend this bill to the House. I think it is a great thing that we put aside for the future and that we help to pay for the obligations of the past as soon as we possibly can. I look forward to the support of the House for this bill.

Time expired.

[3.36 p.m.]
Mr BARNETT (Lyons - Treasurer) - Honourable Speaker, before I sum up, I would like to make a point of clarification. I would like to correct the record in relation to a comment in my second reading speech that the final GST entitlement is published in the Treasurer's annual financial report by 31 January. Tasmania's final GST outcome is not known until the Australian Government's final budget outcome is published, which is to be no later than 30 September following the financial year.

The SPEAKER - I would like to clarify: you are amending your second reading speech?

Mr BARNETT - I have just provided that point of clarification.

The SPEAKER - Is it a point of clarification, or are you amending the second reading speech? I just want to be sure.

Mr BARNETT - Thank you. Yes.

The SPEAKER - I am asking if you are amending the second reading speech, because that comes with a legal intent. That is what you are doing?

Mr BARNETT - Correct. That is why I have done exactly what I have done at the beginning of my response - 

The SPEAKER - It has to be very clear so we then amend the second reading speech for you - 

Mr BARNETT - in my summing up. It is very clear.
The SPEAKER - Keep talking while I am, that is fine.

Mr BARNETT - Thank you for that. In terms of thanking the members for their contributions on the bill today, I acknowledge the points that have been well made right through this Chamber, in particular from our side of the House.

I would like to respond in my summing up to Mr Bayley and the amendments. I said I would, and I will do that in my summing up. I will come to that shortly.

I would like to make a few remarks first. I want to acknowledge the member for Clark, Kristie Johnston, for her remarks. I give particular recognition to the former treasurer, Mr Ferguson, member for Bass. I acknowledge his fine, upstanding and outstanding work as a treasurer. He ensured that we have very good financial management of our budget and are building a stronger economy, and that has continued under our government since 2014. 

It is very important to acknowledge that in relation to the $240-million GST exemption for Macquarie Point - the Treasurer had to fight very hard for that, and he did. Ultimately - yes, it was soon after I became Treasurer - I got that letter from the honourable Jim Chalmers saying that that exemption would be provided. I received it, but it was as a result of the hard work, diligence and advocacy of Mr Ferguson. The point that has been made by Mr Ferguson and indeed others is that state Labor did very little to help make that happen. In fact, almost argued that it was not to progress. It is disappointing, and I note that we did not get that full support at the time, but through the dogged advocacy of the treasurer meant that exemption was provided. 

I thank the member for Braddon, Miriam Beswick, for her contribution. I know you have a very special interest in financial affairs and budget management, and that is acknowledged. You made the point about confidence in the business community and in the community more generally for strong budget and financial management. I acknowledge that, and thank you for that.

Mrs Beswick asked why only 50 per cent? That can be a discussion and a debate for another day perhaps, but we thought, based on our advice and the commitment given to the Tasmanian people, that 50 per cent was the right amount to provide those guardrails and those guidelines to future governments, whether it is our government or future governments with regard to that windfall GST gain. I wanted to acknowledge that. 

The honourable member made mention of the financial and moral responsibility we have to the community and to future generations of Tasmanians, and that is what we are setting up here. This is a legislative regime to ensure that there is a sustainable financial management in the years and decades ahead, because this cannot be changed without the approval of both Houses of parliament.

I want to thank the Minister for Finance, Mr Jaensch, for his thoughtful contribution. He made some very good points with regard to the Leader for the Opposition and why those questions were going to the Minister for Finance earlier this week. They were well outlined and made mention of Labor's own-source revenue plans. What we know since that analysis was released earlier in the week is that it will hike up taxes for Tasmanians, and they are going to cop it in the neck - some $2.8 billion in the years ahead.

We also know with regard to the GBE reforms under Labor that they want to maximise those profits from the GBEs. We want a team Tasmania approach. That was demonstrated today with the tabling of the more than 200-page bill on the government business governance reforms process. I am really pleased with that progress and with the effort that has been made. I also acknowledge Mr Behrakis and other members who have made contributions. 

In summing up, I wanted to recap some of the key parts of this bill, because it delivers on the commitment of our government to address the state's unfunded superannuation liability. It is a growing burden that we cannot in good conscience pass on to future generations. 

Mr Bayley - There were some questions of mine; are you going to address those?

Mr BARNETT - Yes, I am definitely going to be covering that shortly. Thank you for that interjection.

The mechanism is simple and effective. When Tasmania receives more GST revenue than forecast, half of that unexpected surplus will be placed into a dedicated fund, the superannuation liability fund. This fund, protected by legislation, will be used exclusively to reduce the state superannuation debt and cannot be used for any other purpose without the approval, as I have indicated, of both Houses of parliament. It introduces a disciplined, transparent and open process going forward. I think it is smart, forward-looking and financially responsible.

In terms of that impact, the long-term projections of the general government superannuation liability were provided in the 2024-25 budget papers, where the liability was estimated to be $7.257 billion as of 30 June 2025 and a decrease of $7.1 billion at 30 June 2028. The budget also shows that the superannuation costs are higher than borrowing costs and the Reimbursement Expense Receipt (RER) also reflects this. I believe that was a point that was discussed earlier and I just wanted to give that advice from Treasury. Based on that actuarial advice, the current and emerging cash cost of the defined benefit superannuation is higher than the borrowing costs shown in the budget and the RER. Again, that was discussed earlier and I have responded to those queries.

The emerging cash cost of defined benefit superannuation payments is met from the public account, funded partly by agency contributions and by reserved-by-law contribution, which comprises the balance of the government share of pension and lump sum benefit costs. Over time, the scheme's total cost will depend on a number of factors, including the amount of benefits the scheme pays, the number of people paid benefits, for example, mortality, marital status are estimated, scheme expenses and the amount earned on any assets invested to pay the benefits. These variables will change over the life of the liability. The variables are uncertain at the variation date and estimated by the actuary.

Based on the long-term projections provided in the 2024-25 budget papers, the estimated government share of the emerging cash cost is $368.3 million, increasing to $410.1 million in 2027-28. The emerging cash cost will increase to an anticipated peak in 2034-35 with a projected cash cost of $500 million. The billing provides for the creation of an account to be created in the public account called the Superannuation Liability Fund.

In terms of the GST calculations, our GST windfall occurs when Tasmania's final GST entitlement for a financial year is greater than the budget year estimate of GST revenues published in the Tasmanian state budget for that financial year. The state's final GST entitlement is confirmed in the Australian Government's final budget outcome, which has to be published by 30 September following the financial year end. I just wanted to confirm that, which I did at the beginning of this summing up.

Tasmania's final GST entitlement depends on three variable elements: the state's GST relativity for the financial year, the GST revenue collected by the Australian Government, known as the GST pool, and the state share of the national population. Estimates of GST revenue in the state budget are based on the best information available at the time. Some or all of the three elements that define Tasmania's final GST entitlement for the financial year are not finalised at the time of preparing the state budget.

Tasmania's final GST relativity for the year is recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in February each year and determined by the Australian treasurer by the time the state budget is prepared in and around May. As such, in a typical year, the state's GST relativity does not drive the difference between GST budget year estimates and the state's final GST entitlement. A GST windfall usually occurs when the actual GST revenue collections or the state's share of the national population, or both, are greater than was estimated by the Australian Government at the time of preparing the Tasmanian State Budget. These are only confirmed in the Australian Government's final budget outcome in September following the financial year end.

Under usual state budget cycles, actual GST revenue collections and the state's final share of the national population are typically not finalised at the time state budget estimates are prepared and this results in a difference between GST budget year estimates and the final GST entitlement. GST windfalls can only be calculated once final GST entitlements have been confirmed. It is not possible to meaningfully forecast or model the possible impact of future GST windfalls on the superannuation liability.

In general, GST windfalls occur due to an increase in Tasmania's share of the population, an increase in the GST pool compared to the Australian Government's estimates, or both. For example: all other things being equal, each one per cent change in Tasmania's share of the national population is estimated to increase Tasmania's GST revenue by $36 million each year, and each one per cent change in the GST pool is estimated to increase Tasmania's GST revenue by $38 million each year.

Over the ten years to 2023-24, Tasmania's final GST entitlements have usually been within 0.7 per cent to 1.7 per cent of the state budget GST estimate for the year. However, greater volatility between estimated and final GST entitlements occurred during the financial years impacted by COVID-19. This was primarily due to the highly unusual and uncertain economic conditions of the time which impacted national consumer spending patterns and the accuracy of the Australian Government's forecast of the GST.

Based on the last budget papers, the GST share is 39.3 per cent of total revenues, federal government GST plus other federal government payments is 65.2 per cent, and Tasmanian revenues is 34.8 per cent of total revenues.

In terms of the GST revenue, it is the state's single biggest source of revenue. A $1 commitment delivers a $1.82 return as at this time. The Tasmanian Government has been relentlessly lobbying the federal government over many years regarding GST distributions to Tasmania, and the federal government announced a three-year extension to the 'no worse off' guarantee from 2026-27 until 2029-30. That outcome is the result of our advocacy on the national stage. It represents a step forward for securing funding for Tasmania, and without it Tasmania would be $260 million worse off.

While this outcome ensures we do not lose hundreds of millions in GST distributions to Tasmania in the short term, we will not stop in our pursuit of a permanent and ongoing agreement to ensure that we always receive our fair share. I have made that point very clear in the public arena in recent weeks and months. We have been determined in our pursuit of the federal government over this matter. The GST 'no worse off' guarantee payments are critical to Tasmania's finances.

I note that I have congratulated the federal Treasurer, Jim Chalmers; I communicated my congratulations to him on his re-election, and look forward to working with him in the months and years ahead. I will continue, of course, to advocate for Tasmania and for our fair share. It was good to be in a meeting of Board of Treasurers in recent weeks as well, which is of state and territory treasurers alone. We discussed a lot of matters of mutual interest, including the GST.

I would like to address the Greens' amendments at a high level. I am happy to discuss them in committee, but I want to make it clear that if these amendments are accepted, no monies can be paid into the superannuation liability fund unless there is a cash surplus for that year. Until then, any GST windfall would not be used to offset the biggest liability on the state's balance sheet, and would be paid into the public account for the services of government.

In my view, the government's view, these amendments do not represent responsible fiscal management. Rather, the treasurer of the day could do whatever they wanted with that windfall without any transparency. I am not quite sure how that is responsible and transparent financial management. You are taking away the guardrails - and I think that was a point well made by the former treasurer and member for Bass in his contribution - you are taking away the guardrails. It seems countercultural to normal Green policy and process and position over past months and years.

I believe we have the balance right in this bill. It is prudent that any windfall over and above what is budgeted in the state budget is set aside to assist in meeting our future liabilities. It is important that these funds are set aside and quarantined to offset this huge ongoing liability that the former Labor-Greens government bestowed on us. I know the Greens would not want to continue that burden, but that is the effect of the Greens' amendment.

The bill represents a prudent financial management to direct the windfall to the highest cost and to transparently set aside funds to meet a future cost. The bill will impose discipline on governments now and well into the future and will stop a treasurer from using windfalls for whatever purposes they desire. Currently, there is no transparency as to how these windfalls are spent. This bill provides greater transparency and accountability for this government and future governments.

With that said, I will commend the bill to the House and look forward to, all being well, support for that motion. 

Bill read the second time. 
SUPERANNUATION LIABILITY (GST WINDFALL FUND)BILL 2025 (No. 17)

In Committee

Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. 

Clause 3 - 
Interpretation 

Mr BAYLEY - I move -

That on page 3, clause 3, before the definition of Contributory Scheme

Insert the following definitions - 

Budget papers, in relation to a financial year, means the information tabled by the Treasurer in support of an Appropriation Act, within the meaning of section 36 of the Constitution Act 1934, for that financial year;

cash surplus, in respect of a financial year, means a positive balance of net cash flows from operating activities plus net cash flows from non-financial assets, in respect of the General Government Sector as reported in the Budget papers;

Deputy Chair, to speak to these, if I may: I feel like I was almost talking into a vacuum there in raising concerns about the strategy, wisdom and logic of this. Given that we are not in a cash surplus situation at the moment and not projected to be for some time and there could be that the return to surplus is a mirage, it is clear and our advice is that this is a gimmick unless we are in a cash surplus.

Our amendments in totality basically seek to change the parameters of this to make sure that the GST windfall is only paid in those circumstances where the general government sector is running a cash surplus.

The first amendment, this one introduces a definition of cash surplus and relocates the current definition of budget papers from clause 4 to clause 3, is really important. All I heard from the government members in their various contributions seeking to talk this out, because they have very little other legislation on the books to actually fill the day, is a political argument - or a political argument bashing the Labor Party about raiding the barn, so to speak, for the hay. While that may have been the case, it does not change the fact that this is a gimmick and that unless we are running a cash surplus, there could be better things we spend the GST windfall on.

Now, the Treasurer just talked about transparency and that there would be a lack of transparency about where those GST windfalls are spent - well, the budget is transparency, Treasurer. The budget would actually detail where money is going and it could be asked of the treasurer and of various ministers in the Estimates process and it can be determined where that extra GST is being invested.
I guess what we are trying to remove here is the compulsion that 50 per cent of GST windfall must be spent and put into this fund because there may well be better things that that GST windfall can be spent on in that particular year, and it should be available to the Treasurer and to the government of the day to spend that on those other things. It might be paying down debt, it might be avoiding going into further debt and there is, I think, little analysis that actually justifies the fact that this is a better way of managing those GST windfalls, and there was very little in either the Treasurer's contribution or particularly any of the other members' contributions that actually addressed this issue of cash surpluses and the value of only paying into this kind of account if there is a cash surplus.

Let me be really clear: we are not opposed to this kind of fund. We think it is wise to set up this kind of fund and we absolutely think it is wise to invest in it to pay down the superannuation liability. We have no interest in politicising this. We will not be putting social media out about this, but we have had external advice that this is a gimmick. We have the analysis that there is very little modelling that actually underpins this bill, and we are clear in our minds that the only reason we should be paying our GST windfall into a fund such as this is when we are in a cash surplus position and, when we are in that position, great, pay that money in and start to build it up. Let us hope we get into that situation as soon as possible, but, in the absence of that, there is no guarantee that paying money into the superannuation liability fund would be value for money, and there is certainly no guarantee that it would be better value than doing something else with that money, and, quite distinct from guardrails, what this does is just channel to the treasurer and channel this money in with no options otherwise - no options even though there may well be better things to spend that money on.

So, these amendments-

Mr Shelton - You would rather spend the money to drain Lake Pedder or something like that.

Mr Willie - You both do not understand it, they can actually -

DEPUTY CHAIR - Order. The member will be heard in silence.

Mr BAYLEY - No, there might be way better things to spend it on, member for Lyons. It could well be that, but you may well save more money and actually could deliver better efficiencies by spending it on other things or not borrowing money to pay for a deficit, which is the situation we are going to be in in the future. These amendments are pretty simple. They just switch definitions from one clause to another and set up a definition for cash surplus in order to enable the subsequent amendments that set those parameters or at least remove those parameters that 50 per cent of GST windfalls must be paid into this account.

[4.01 p.m.]
Mrs BESWICK (Braddon) - Deputy Chair, I rise to say it is a little bizarre to say that there is something better you could spend this money on. This is putting the money into something which is actually already a debt, so we could pay down a debt or we could pay down a liability. Either way, we are paying off a debt.

I do not quite understand how you think this makes any difference whatsoever. If you go, 'We are only going to do it in a cash surplus,' it is a lovely, airy-fairy idea. If we are in a cash surplus, we will find many things to spend our cash on, I am sure, but if we do not set it aside and make a rule and say, 'No, we have to be serious, we have to be sensible, we need to put it away', it is never going to happen. That is all I have to say.

Mr BAYLEY - All I can say, member for Braddon, is that we have advice from eminent external experts that demonstrates that, in a cash deficit situation, this is little more than a gimmick and, as we have made that point repeatedly, that this is an election commitment made three days out from election purely to throw shade over the Labor Party and its strategy of raiding the hay from the barn. What we are trying to do is remove the compulsion that the GST be invested into this fund and keep the freedom of the Treasurer and the government of the day to be able to spend it on what is going to deliver the best return overall. 

The fact is that we could deliver a better return from investing those GST windfalls in something else. If we could deliver a better return if we are investing it in something else, why would we compel the Treasurer to put it into this fund?

Mrs Beswick - An investment is an investment.

DEPUTY CHAIR - Order, Mrs Beswick.

Mr BAYLEY - We support a fund. We support this being paid down. 

Mrs Beswick - You obviously do not. 

DEPUTY CHAIR - Order.

Mr BAYLEY - If you can get a better return by doing something else with it, like not borrowing more money, like paying down something else, then why would you compel the Treasurer to do this? That is our point. 

Mr WILLIE - You are half right in that this is a gimmick. It is a gimmick. Having 50 per cent of the windfall go into this new, specific purpose account is effectively legislation to establish a new account for Treasury, and that is it.

Treasury can do some of these things now. In fact, in the briefing that I had with Treasury officials, they said that if the government made a policy decision before this comes into effect, they could give the RBF a lump sum, or they could put it into this account. When it is in the account, they can use it to service the pension costs, which they are doing from the public account anyway. They are just offsetting the pension costs. They are just funnelling it through this fund. 

You are talking about it being able to be used for other things. It effectively can be, unless they are in a cash surplus. It is a gimmick. It is smoke and mirrors. This is all about politics, and, as I said, they are not responsible budget managers. I do not expect the specific purpose account under them to build up this fund to help service - they will be paying the pension costs with it each year because they will be looking for money, because they are absolutely drowning in debt. That liability is far bigger than the superannuation liability. That is on them.

The servicing costs for the debt in the last year for the forward Estimates is $500 million. That is what this superannuation liability will peak at in 2035. They have absolutely trashed the state's finances. I am telling you what they will end up doing because they have been so irresponsible.

In Estimates, I had a crack at them about their forecasting in the budget. They told me I was wrong. What happened? Five months later, we are back here with nearly half a billion dollars in supplementary appropriation. They are asking for more money on the credit card.

They are just shifting money around. That is what they are doing with this. It is a whole lot of time and effort for parliament. It is a political stunt, effectively. It is a lot of time and effort just to establish a new account for Treasury. 

Mr Barnett - It sounds like you are supporting it.

Mr WILLIE - No, I am not supporting the amendment.

Mr Barnett - It sounds like it.

Mr Bayley - Yes, it sounded like it.

Mr BARNETT - I will respond. Thank you very much for the opportunity. It sounded very much like my shadow treasurer was supporting the remarks and the amendment put by the Greens, but I am advised via interjection that they are not supporting it.

Mr Willie - Not supporting it.

Mr BARNETT - You are not supporting the amendment? I think it is helpful to get clarity, because you were arguing in favour of and supporting the arguments of the Greens member Mr Bayley. I appreciate that. It is free country and a free debate, but at least debate an argument in support of your eventual vote.

Mr Willie - I called it a stunt from the start.

DEPUTY CHAIR - Order.

Mr BARNETT - In short, we do not support the Greens amendment. We have made it very clear that the whole point of this is to have some guardrails going forward for future years. This will be a benefit not just to our generation, but future generations. It is a commitment we made at the election. I have made it very clear that we are delivering on that commitment. There is no trickery in any of that. We are doing exactly what we said we would do, and we are now delivering on that in this bill.

Where Tasmania receives more GST revenue than forecast, where there is a windfall, 50 per cent of that funding will be used to pay down the state superannuation debt. What the Greens are suggesting through their amendments and through clause 3, which the honourable member has read into the Hansard, is basically to remove those guardrails to provide total discretion to the treasurer and the government of the day to do as they please. 

We do not agree. We need some fiscal discipline; we need some economic and budget responsibility. That is what you will see in the budget in a few weeks, which I am really looking forward to delivering. You keep saying there is a mirage. Well, you will see on budget day on 29 May that pathway to surplus. You will see economic responsibility writ large. You will see confidence and investment for not only today but for years to come. That is what you will see, and what this bill does is back that. 

In short, we have had a long debate about this. We have a different view from the Greens. I want to acknowledge the member for Braddon, Miriam Beswick, for her contribution - clear, concise and thoughtful in opposition to the Greens amendment. We do not support the thrust of the Greens' approach whatsoever.

Mr BAYLEY - I have to say that while we have been in this Chamber for a long time on this bill, we have not had a long debate about these elements, because all of your members only stood up and filibustered to bash Labor about their past fiscal strategies and discipline.

If you have fiscal discipline and fiscal responsibility, and if you want to establish a fund and pay into it, you can do that when you choose if you have a GST windfall. Our amendments do not preclude paying into a fund, they just remove the compulsion that you pay 50 per cent of any GST windfall in and make sure that it only happens in a cash surplus year, because in a cash deficit year, it is clear that there could be better options for the government to be spending that money on, avoiding going into further debt. 

If you are indeed fiscally disciplined and responsible, you can manage this in a responsible way and in the way that actually delivers the best return to Tasmanians. What you are doing is setting up a system that may penalise Tasmanians into the future and penalise Tasmanians in the budget from actually being able to get the best possible return from that GST. It is on your head, Treasurer. 

Indeed I agree with you. It sounded like Mr Willie was arguing to back me up and to set himself up to reinforce and vote for this amendment, but it seems the Labor Party today simply cannot bring themselves to back anything that we say, no matter the wisdom and no matter the external advice that is coming.

I say again that an eminent economist -

Members interjecting.

DEPUTY CHAIR - Order.

Mr BAYLEY - that we all refer to, that so many of us respect, has called this a gimmick, and has basically written that explicitly in his review of the state finances - indeed, the very one that Mrs Beswick commissioned when she was a member of the Jacqui Lambie Network. He says:

Even when the budget does return to cash surplus, something which seems unlikely in the next five years, the government should consider again applying some or all of those surpluses into investments which can be used to defray the unfunded superannuation liability as opposed to repaying debt. If so, it should also put in place stronger safeguards to ensure that these funds are not subsequently withdrawn to meet short-term exigencies.

I fully support that. The guardrails are wise in terms of not being able to pull it out at the whim of a treasurer, but simply compelling the treasurer to put it in there when he could actually deliver a better return for that money seems a defeatist strategy, and one that is ultimately going to short-change the people and the taxpayer of Tasmania.

Mr BARNETT - I want to respond in conclusion to the honourable member. I appreciate your fervour for this matter in clause 3, but quite frankly, the arguments that you give do not fit recent history, and that history was that the Labor-Greens government took $1.5 billion. They raided the Superannuation Guarantee Fund - $1.5 billion - and they used it for other purposes. This is exactly what has happened, and you now have $350 million that is now being paid thanks to the Tasmanian taxpayer, because of that action. We are cleaning up the budget mess that was left all those years ago. $1.5 billion is a lot of money, and repayments will rise to $500 million by 2035 based on the advice I have received. That goes against your arguments, Mr Bayley. That is an example of exactly why we need this legislation.

Again, I commend Tony Rundle, the former premier and former treasurer, who set up that special purpose account in the first place. I put that on the record again. Thank you.

Mr BAYLEY - Treasurer, you either deliberately misrepresent or misunderstand the amendments, because we are not seeking to amend the proclusion from raiding this fund and spending it on something else. That stands intact, even notwithstanding our amendments. This is not about getting the money out. It would only ever get paid out to pay superannuation liabilities. This is about removing the compulsion on you, as Treasurer, to pay that money in a cash-deficit situation. It would only allow that to happen in a cash-surplus situation, which is what the eminent economists, including Saul Eslake in his review of the state's finances, recommend. Anything otherwise is a gimmick.

If this parliament wants to pass a gimmick and the Labor Party wants to give you a free kick to meet your political needs, three days out from last election, that is on them. We have advice to say that setting some parameters and removing that compulsion for 50 per cent of the GST windfall to be paid into this fund would be wise, because the taxpayer could get better return for that dollar doing something else in the years that it comes.

On the budget more broadly, and on the one that you are going to deliver, you keep talking about the pathway to surplus - we will be asking very closely for you to spell that out very clearly, because no one else in the world apart from people on that side of the House seems to be able to see this pathway to surplus; not us when we analyse your figures, not the external economists and commentators. That will be your obligation, and we will hold you to your commitment today, Treasurer, to clearly spell out that pathway to surplus.

If we do get into that cash-surplus situation, this debate is moot because 50 per cent of GST windfalls going into that fund will be a good thing. I 100 per cent agree with Mrs Beswick about that. Until we get into that cash-surplus situation, we are short changing the people of Tasmania. That is why we are absolutely willing to support this bill, but not if it has this compulsion for 50 per cent of GST windfall having to be paid into this fund, even in a deficit situation.

Mr WILLIE - I could not let that comment from the Greens go past. This is not a 'free kick' for the government. I have explained how this does put some architecture in place for a prudent government about some options - a lump sum, and investment from the RBF who are more aggressive in their investment strategy and greater returns, which could snowball and you get a greater value for your money, and the tax offset options, they are there.

Effectively, I have explained how it is money laundering and what they will do with it, too. It is a bit of a gimmick, but it does put in some architecture. If a government was being responsible, it does give them some options. I do take issue with that. It is not a 'free kick', and if you actually understood it, you would know that.

Mr Bayley - Thanks for the lecture.

COMMUNITY PROTECTION (OFFENDER REPORTING) AMENDMENT BILL 2024 (No. 56)

Second Reading

[4.31 p.m.]
Mr ELLIS (Braddon - Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Management) - Honourable Speaker, I move - 

That the bill be now read a second time.

The Community Protection (Offender Reporting) Amendment Bill 2024, known as Daniel's Law, will strengthen community safety by tightening reporting and monitoring requirements for known sex offenders, and significantly improving the collection and sharing of information under the Community Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2005 to better prevent sexual harm.

Sexual offending is a devastating crime that shatters the lives of victims, with far-reaching impacts that ripple through families, communities and society. For children, the trauma is especially profound as they are uniquely vulnerable due to their dependence, limited understanding of consent, and emotional immaturity. The damage extends beyond the survivor, eroding trust, safety, and justice in our communities. These harms can span generations, impacting loved ones, caregivers, and even professionals. As a society, we have a responsibility to support and listen to victim-survivors and take decisive action to prevent further harm.

In December 2003, 13-year-old Daniel Morcombe, who was living with his parents and brothers in the town of Palmwoods on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, was abducted and murdered by a twice convicted paedophile. Since 2014, the Morcombe family have advocated for increased access to sex offender registers across Australia. I acknowledge their advocacy and the resilience of the Morcombe family through the Daniel Morcombe Foundation, and its supporters, which is now in its 20th year.

Queensland has released a sex offender registration scheme bill this week on the 20th anniversary of the foundation. The bill in Queensland is to be known as Daniel's Law, in honour of the Morcombes' son, Daniel. In Tasmania, we hope to stand with them and other states and territories in the future who will act in Daniel's name to keep children safe.

By way of background, the Community Protection Offender Reporting Act was introduced to implement sex offender registration in Tasmania as part of a framework of statutory registration schemes of sex offenders across Australia. The act requires the Commissioner of Police to establish and maintain a Community Protection Offender Reporting Register and to appoint a registrar for this purpose. The register is a confidential record of personal information reported by people who have been convicted of a reportable offence under the act who at the time of sentencing had been ordered by the court to be registered.

The act requires a reportable offender to keep the registrar informed of their whereabouts and other personal details for the duration of the registration order made by the court. In Tasmania, there are just over 400 reportable offenders currently recorded on the register. As part of the national approach, no matter where in Australia a person is recorded on a register, persons with court-imposed reporting obligations cannot avoid or circumvent these obligations by moving interstate. Instead, they become a corresponding reportable offender and are monitored in their new state of residence under corresponding legislation.

The act's inception in the early 2000s was offender-centric, written in such a way as to be highly protective of the information recorded on the register, making the circumstances in which information can be disclosed highly restricted. The current limitations of disclosure prompted Judge Turnbull of the Federal Circuit of Family Court of Australia to make a referral in January 2023 to the Commission of Inquiry into the Tasmanian Government's Response to Child Sexual Abuse in Institutional Settings about the restrictive operation of the confidentiality and release of information clauses in the act. Judge Turnbull requested the legislation be reviewed to ensure it is properly protecting children by allowing for information on reportable offenders to be readily accessible by child safety services to determine whether children coming to notice were at risk of sexual abuse.

Although the act has been amended on two previous occasions, once to include the provision to make Community Protection Orders under section 10A and on another occasion to recognise corresponding orders, no significant review of the act has been undertaken since it commenced. Issues and limitations with the practical operation of the act to effectively monitor offenders and to prevent the further offending given technological and other advances, have become evident. Additionally, our understanding of how sexual offences are committed has changed significantly.

We now have a better understanding of the complexity of these matters, and we need to have legislation that can be used effectively to prevent known sex offenders from committing these heinous crimes. We need legislation that can be used to actively protect children and the community from the devastating consequences of sexual harm.

In developing this bill, the government looked in particular to the disclosure model that was introduced in Western Australia. Since the bill has been introduced, it is encouraging to see equivalent reforms more recently being implemented in South Australia and also announced in Queensland. These jurisdictions have followed a three tier disclosure model that is based closely on Western Australia's successful approach.

The bill seeks to achieve a shift away from the offender-centric legislation to the act that upholds and strengthens protection for our children and our community. The long title of the act is being amended to reflect this reframing and will add an express objective of protecting children and allowing information on the register to be disclosed for the safety and protection of children and the community. This will ensure that the court will consider the protection and safety of our community as a priority and will ensure the act is consistent with contemporary national and international principles of child protection.

An order of the registration of a reportable offender is currently not mandatory at the time of sentencing. The bill will make changes to Section 6 of the act by removing the court's discretionary power to make an order for registration and replacing it with a new requirement to cause a person who has been sentenced to a reportable offence to be registered and comply with their obligations under the act. This requirement will be balanced with new provisions that give the court discretionary powers when deciding to make a person a reportable offender if the person is sentenced for a class 1 offence and the court is satisfied that they do not pose an unreasonable risk to the community, or if the person is sentenced for a class 2 or 3 offence and the court is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist that indicate the person does not pose a risk to the community.

In deciding when exceptional circumstances exist, the bill will insert a new provision that requires the court to give paramount consideration to the safety and protection of children and the community. Currently, the courts can consider a number of factors in making an order for the registration of an offender. These considerations will be expanded to allow the courts to consider an offender's prior convictions and previous reporting orders and any pattern in the commission of offences indicated by that history.

This is an important amendment that addresses contemporary understandings of how offenders perpetrate sexual and other serious offences, particularly in recognising patterns in behaviour that provide vital clues to the potential for future offending. Section 10A of the act enables the commissioner to make an application to a magistrate for a community protection order in circumstances where the commissioner is satisfied that a reportable offender poses a risk to the safety and wellbeing of any child.

A community protection order prohibits or restricts the movement or conduct of reportable offenders. The bill includes new provisions that expand the conditions that the court may impose on a reportable offender under a community protection order that has been applied for by the Commissioner of Police. Currently, the conditions that can be imposed include limiting the reportable offender from consuming intoxicating liquor or restricting the offender from making contact with specified person or persons among others.

These conditions will be expanded to include restricting the reportable offender from accessing the internet. We know that heinous crimes are committed online, such as the grooming of children and young people. That is why restricting a reportable offender's access to the internet is paramount to protecting the safety of our children and young people online. The new provisions will also allow the court to impose tougher conditions such as requiring an offender to submit to electronic monitoring and to surrender their passport to Tasmania Police. The ability for the court to impose these conditions is important to limiting the movements of reportable offenders within and outside Tasmania.

In recognising the need to take a therapeutic approach for young offenders, the bill makes several changes to the registration of children and young people who have committed reportable offences. Section 6 will be amended to allow the court to omit making a child a reportable offender where the court is satisfied that the child does not pose an unreasonable risk or of committing another reportable offence. Section 23b of the act, which deals with the variation of reporting obligations of young reportable offenders, will also be amended to include the considerations of whether the young offender poses an unreasonable risk to the community.

Further, the class 1, 2 and 3 offences will be amended to recognise the difference in children being involved in the production of child exploitation material in circumstances where they are taking selfies or consensual pictures, as opposed to adults who make, possess or produce child exploitation material. Currently, a reportable offender under the act is not prevented from applying for or engaging in child-related work. In light of the commission of inquiry, this lack of restriction on reportable offenders poses an unacceptable risk to Tasmanian children and is out of step with community expectations.

Other jurisdictions, including South Australia, the Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory and Victoria have provisions that prohibit reportable offenders engaging in child-related work. To bring the act in line with these jurisdictions and with our own community expectations, the bill will introduce a new part 2A, which deals with child-related services and the disclosure of information in relation to the charges. The new section 15B will automatically exclude reportable offenders from working in child-related services. The provision will only apply to a reportable offender who is not a child or who is not a child at the time of the relevant offending. This is an offence-creating provision. It will be a defence if the defendant can prove that they did not know that it was a child-related service. 

The new part will also provide for the commissioner to require a charged person to provide information about whether they are engaged in any child-related services and whether they have any reportable contact with a child. The commissioner will also have the ability to advise an employer or prospective employer of a charged person that the person has been charged with a reportable offence and to provide the details of that offence. The commissioner will have the same ability in relation to any parent, guardian or carer of a child with whom the person has reportable contact.

Under the new part, a person who is charged with a reportable offence and who also engages in the provision of child-related services will be required to disclose to their employer that they have been charged with a reportable offence within seven days of being charged with that offence. Anyone who receives an information disclosure under the new part will not be permitted to disclose the information to any other person other than in certain circumstances, including court proceedings, obtaining legal advice or for the management of the person who is the subject of the disclosure. It will be an offence to disclose that information for any reason other than the prescribed purposes. 

The bill will provide for new reporting obligations for offenders. Section 17 of the act, which deals with the personal details that a reportable offender must provide to the registrar, will be expanded to provide that a reportable offender must share their relationship status and details of their partner, as well as details of any electronic monitoring that they are subject to.

The amendment will also require that a reportable offender is to present to the registrar any working with vulnerable people card issued to them. I want to make it clear at this point that we are taking as many precautions as possible to ensure the protection of children. Whilst we have processes in place to restrict reportable offenders for gaining a working with vulnerable people card, we are adding these extra protections to ensure that in the event that a card is issued it must be disclosed by the offender. 

Section 18 of the act will be substituted so that, in addition to the requirement to report annually to the registrar, reportable offenders will be required to report at such other times as directed by the registrar. Additionally, reportable offenders will be required to report on any intended absences from Tasmania, which would include details of their travel, reasons for travel, and details of location and travel companions, among other things.

We are taking a tougher approach to tracking reportable offenders' whereabouts to ensure that they are fully scrutinised in their movements and to restrict their opportunities to reoffend. The bill will also amend the length of reporting periods as prescribed under Section 24 of the act. With regard to reporting periods, the court will have some discretion to shape an order depending on the scale of offending and reflecting the severity of the offences.
If a reportable offender commits a single class 1 offence, the court will be able to impose a reporting period between three years and eight years. Where the offender commits one class 2 or one class 3 offence or more than one class 1 offence, the reportable period will be a period between eight years and 15 years as determined by the court. For serious offences outlined in section 24 (3)(a) or (b), or for the offence of persistent sexual abuse of a child under Section 125A of the Criminal Code, the order length will be between 15 years and life as determined by the court. 

The amendment will also clarify that the court may consider previous convictions in determining the length of the reporting period. These changes will effectively impose a minimum reporting period on offenders depending on the offences they commit. This is an important step in recognising the real risk that offenders pose to children and to the wider community through potential for them to reoffend.

In recognition of the fact that a reportable offender's circumstances can change throughout their reporting period, the bill will insert a new section, 27A, to provide that the commissioner can suspend or revoke reporting obligations under certain circumstances. These circumstances include where the offender was a child for the last offence that made them a reportable offender, where they have cognitive or physical impairment, or where they have a mental illness. These conditions will not be qualified by the commissioner's satisfaction that the offender does not pose an unreasonable risk of offending again. The commissioner will be required to give written notice of a suspension or revocation, and the revocation or suspension will take effect when the notice is served.

The bill will introduce a new disclosure scheme that will allow concerned parents and carers to apply for information on the register about people who have unsupervised contact with their children. Necessary amendments are also made to ensure that the commissioner can disclose information on the register for this purpose. It will empower parents, guardians and caregivers to ensure that they can access the information they need to make informed decisions to protect their children.

The bill will also allow the commissioner to release the personal details of a reportable offender to the community when the whereabouts or location of that offender is not known. This is to ensure the safety of our children and our community and that that safety is paramount.

The bill will balance this disclosure scheme with a new offence that prevents anyone from publishing, distributing or displaying information from the register without the written approval of the minister. It will also introduce a new offence against public conduct that intends to cause harassment of a reportable offender whose information is disclosed under the act.

We received a large amount of community feedback on this particular issue. I would like to thank all those who raised concerns with the proposed offence, and I want to assure you that we have listened. As a result, we have removed the word 'animosity' and altered the wording of the provision so that it clearly reflects the intended purpose that is only to apply to information recorded and disclosed under the act, and not to apply in any way to victim-survivors who wish to make public comment about the abuse that they have suffered.

The feedback on this provision and subsequent amendments of the bill demonstrates the powerful value of public consultation in legislation drafting processes. Again, I thank all those who provided feedback on this bill. I assure the community that the intent of the provision is to balance the right to privacy and safety of reportable offenders with the new disclosure scheme established under the bill that creates a free flow of information for the purposes of child protection. It is in no way designed to silence the voice of victim-survivors.

As it is currently drafted, the act restricts the exchange of information on the register for law enforcement and child protection purposes, including between other government agencies. This bill therefore includes changes that will make it easier for Tasmania Police to share information on the register for law enforcement and child safety purposes. Section 44 of the act will be amended to define relevant agencies for the purposes of information disclosure. That will include the commissioners of the Australian Federal Police and the police forces of another state or territory.

The new definition of relevant agency is expanded to include other government authorities of the Commonwealth or of the state or territory, including government agencies within Tasmania which are responsible for the protection of children or reportable offender management. These changes are necessary and important for strengthening our capability to support national objectives to enhancing child safety.

The bill will amend a number of offence provisions to provide for tougher penalties. If a reportable offender fails to comply with their obligations under the act, they will be liable to a fine of not exceeding 200 penalty units or imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or both. The same increase in penalty will apply to the offences of failing to comply with a community protection order or interim community protection order, and the offence of providing false or misleading information. The offence of failing to comply with the act will attract the same increased penalty.

The bill also introduces new powers for Tasmania Police to monitor and ensure compliance with reporting requirements under the act. The amendment will provide a police officer the power to search a reportable offender in certain circumstances. The new section 45B will be inserted to provide for a general power of arrest without warrant where a police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that a person has committed an offence under the act. Additionally, a new section 45C will be inserted to clarify and consolidate the current powers to enter and search places, premises, conveyances and containers and to verify personal details, which are currently written across two sections. The new section will also add a power for police to search the devices of reportable offenders. The clarification and strengthening of police powers under the act is an important step in increasing the ability of Tasmania Police to monitor reportable offenders and enforce their obligations under the act.

A reportable offence is generally one of three classes of offence under the act, and is prescribed in corresponding schedules of the act. The class of the offence determines the maximum amount of time that a reporting period can be imposed on a person by the court. The schedule of offences, as they are currently constructed, do not align with community expectations. The bill therefore repeals these schedules and replaces them with three new schedules.

The new schedules move offences across classes for consistency with offences contained in other Tasmanian statutes, as well as recognising the seriousness of those offences. The schedules will also include new relevant offences, including Commonwealth Criminal Code offences such as the crime of persistent sexual abuse.

Our government is committed to providing opportunities for community involvement in the development and review of government policy and legislation. As part of the development of this bill, we invited feedback from the community through an extensive consultation process across three months from December 2023 to March 2024. We not only received written submissions, but we reached out to community through in-person consultation feedback sessions.

Over the year, we have continued to listen and to hear what the community had to say about the proposed amendments. I would like to thank everyone who provided feedback in relation to this bill, especially victim-survivors. Your courage and strength is extremely powerful in making changes that will assist to protect our community. We have taken your feedback on board and we have redrafted this bill to ensure that it is strengthened to protect our children and our community from sexual predators.

Some in our community will say that these amendments impinge on the rights of offenders. To that, our government says that we need to protect our community, and that the need to protect our children far outweighs the need to protect the civil liberties of those in society who would commit horrific crimes against children. It is acknowledged that the bill is not a cure-all for addressing recidivist offending. As we know, reasons for offending can be complex and heinous and, unfortunately, no single approach can eliminate such a scourge from our community. However, our government is committed to protecting Tasmanian children, adults and the community from harm.

By imposing tougher obligations on reportable offenders and increasing the capability of Tasmania Police to ensure compliance with reporting requirements, we are sending a strong message to offenders that their activities are always subject to scrutiny. We are also making a promise to our children and our community that we will do everything we can to protect you with the additional safety net of these new laws.

Honourable Speaker, I commend the bill to the House. 

I move -

That the debate be adjourned.

Debate adjourned.


ADJOURNMENT

[4.56 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Leader of the House) - Honourable Speaker, I move -

That the House do now adjourn.


Personal Explanation - Member for Franklin - Minister Abetz

[4.57 p.m.]
Mr ABETZ (Franklin - Minister for Business, Industry and Resources) - Honourable Speaker, in recent times, I have been pleased and heartened to observe how those opposite hang on every word I utter. In Question Time today, it was suggested by those opposite that my assertion that the Premier had said, on 14 February 2024, 'The stadium financing would be $375 million both by way of a capital contribution and borrowings' was not correct.

I thank the opposition for their diligence, and can now report to my fellow Tasmanians that, from time to time, they do serve a useful purpose. I was incorrect. I can assure the House it was my honest and genuine belief, but the fact it was my honest and genuine belief does not make it correct. I was a rookie candidate at the time, on 14 February. My recollection and subsequent assertion, although honestly believed, was wrong, and I correct the record. Nevertheless, also for the record, I confirm that prior to the statement of 14 February, the well-publicised strategic business case stated exceptionally clearly on pages 9 and 65 that borrowings were part of the stadium financing proposition.

That never changed, nor was it derogated from by the government. Borrowings have always been part of the equation, as the Premier made abundantly clear today. However, I was wrong to assert that borrowings were specifically mentioned by the Premier on 14 February; I correct the record and apologise. I will similarly be immediately advising Mr Compton of the ABC. I thank the House.


Community Services Funding

[4.58 p.m.]
Ms ROSOL (Bass) - Honourable Speaker, the stadium is sucking air out of every other important issue in Tasmania right now. It is also sucking the money out of so many services in our state as the government try to scrabble together the dollars to fund a stadium we do not need and cannot afford. 

In my role as Greens spokesperson for a range of portfolios, including health and mental health, community services, and children and youth, I meet with many organisations, not-for-profits and peak bodies. They all share the same message with me. The demand for their support is growing but the funding available to them is not growing, and they are struggling to meet the need with the funding they have.

On top of that, many organisations are in limbo as we await the budget. They have no certainty that they will even be able to continue to provide programs and services, because in less than two months' time their funding runs out and they do not know if it will be renewed in the budget. Organisations find themselves in the difficult position of being unable to plan ahead, so they are working on worst-case scenarios of losing funding and winding down services. 

An example of this is the Choices mental health program operated by BaptCare. Choices provides wraparound psychosocial support to people in both their men's and women's shelters. They were initially only funded for the men's shelter, but at the government's request they extended the service to the women's shelter. Baptcare received top-up funding to do this, but that funding runs out at the end of June and they have no current certainties. They are having to plan for cutting a service the government has asked for and relied on them to provide. I urge the government to both provide the funding for the continuation of this service and to have the decency to communicate this to BaptCare.

Another example is the local advocacy groups operated by Health Consumers Tasmania for around five years. These groups have enabled local decision-making in relation to the funding of health interventions and services in local communities. Without a renewal of funding, these groups will cease and local communities will lose their voice, having a detrimental impact on health outcomes. Again, I urge the government to commit to ongoing funding of these local advocacy groups and to advise Health Consumers Tasmania of this now, not on budget day. This communication would be a mark of respect for service providers and is essential to continuity of service. 

I want to turn to today's report in the Mercury, where the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) revealed that the Multi-Systemic Therapy, or MST program, is no longer available in the north and north-west of the state. This program provides evidence-based support to young people with serious or escalating antisocial and problematic behaviour, the very behaviour that has been in the news of late. The program has been closed in the north since November and we understand it has also ceased to operate in the south since March. 

This morning, the Premier gave a very slippery answer when asked about this by the member for Franklin. The Premier stated the government supports MST and are working on developing new evidence-based youth forensic mental health services. He also stated the number of young people who had been through the program since 2022. None of those statements provided confirmation that the service is being provided or that it will continue. It seems MST is not operating and may well not operate in the future, since youth forensic mental health services are not the same thing. This is despite MST being a proven program that addresses the youth crime we are currently experiencing in parts of the state. 

A question for the Minister for Children and Youth in relation to this is: how much did the licence for the MST program cost and will MST be continued given the desperate need we have for services that support young people and help them change their behaviour and avoid engagement with the youth justice system? The Greens will continue to pursue these questions. 

We have many wonderful services and providers in this state and they give invaluable support to Tasmanians. The Greens call on the government to treat service providers with the decency they deserve, to fund them adequately and provide certainty through timely communication. They deserve to be treated with respect and to be funded, and so do all Tasmanians who rely on this service.


Petition for Establishment of a Rheumatology Clinic in Launceston 

[5.03 p.m.]
Ms HADDAD (Clark) - Thank you, Speaker. One in four Tasmanians live with arthritis or other musculoskeletal conditions. These are conditions that cause significant inflammation and pain. They can be extremely debilitating and stop people from performing their daily activities. Recently I have been meeting with Arthritis Tasmania CEO Jackie Slyp, who said that for sufferers, everyday activities like brushing your hair, getting dressed, or getting kids ready for school can be extremely difficult.

The good news is that there are treatments that can make a significant difference to the quality of life and pain and inflammation levels of people with arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions. However, there is a massive shortage of these services and treatments in Tasmania, mostly felt in the north and the north-west. At one point, it looked like the government was responding to that need because in the 2023 state Budget they announced $6 million for the establishment of a permanent northern-based persistent pain and rheumatology clinic that was to be based in Launceston with outreach services across the north and the north-west, where there have historically been low to no services for the many northern Tasmanians who rely on them and need them.

However, much to the anger and disappointment of north and north-west Tasmanians needing these services, the progress has halted and funding is reportedly now no longer available. Instead, only a handful of one-off outpatient clinics have been held in the place of a permanent clinic. This is not good enough. It is not what was promised and it is not what is needed by patients. What is needed is a permanent clinic in Launceston, which was promised.

Arthritis Tasmania has said that these outpatient clinics are not only not what is needed by patients, they are also unsuitable for clinicians who are travelling from Hobart overnight for these short-term, one-off clinics. That is why I have sponsored a petition, along with Diana Wilson who is a community member who suffers from polyarthritis. The petition is available on the parliament website and it is open until 21 June this year. 

Diana Wilson lives in Bridport and for a long time has had to make the nearly seven-hour round trip to Hobart, sometimes as often as every three months, to access these services. Now in her 70s, this is not sustainable, and Diana is one of the many northern Tasmanians who was relying on the government to come good on its promise to deliver and build a permanent clinic in Launceston. She said that telehealth does not cut it because when she sees a rheumatologist in Hobart in person, they meticulously go down every joint, checking her neck, her shoulders, her elbows, and the joints in each of her fingers. This simply does not and cannot happen over telehealth. For years she has been making that drive to Hobart, sometimes there and back in a day, to access those services. 

I encourage members to jump onto the parliament website, sign the petition that Diana and I have sponsored together, calling on the government to honour their $6 million election commitment to open a permanent clinic in Launceston for this much-needed service.


Neighbourhood House Week 2025

[5.06 p.m.]
Mr JAENSCH (Braddon - Minister for Community Services) - Thank you, Speaker. Tonight I rise to speak about Neighbourhood House Week 2025, which is being held from this Monday 12 May until 18 May. Neighbourhood House Week celebrates over 1000 neighbourhood houses, community houses and community centres right across Australia. This year's Neighbourhood House Week theme is Ripples of Change, reflecting on the simple, consistent actions that take place in our neighbourhood houses every day that can ultimately affect entire communities in a positive way.
In Tasmania, we have 35 houses that are part of the Neighbourhood Houses network. I often spend time in neighbourhood houses as I know many of us in this place do. As we know, no two houses are the same. Each is place-based and community-led. Each provides supports and services that are needed in the way that is most suited to each of their communities. Each house works with a network of partners including schools, community services, governments, councils, local businesses and training providers. Ripples of change are created in many various ways across the network.

At Burnie Community House, Curious Chefs provides people with cooking and kitchen skills to make healthy home-cooked meals that the entire family can enjoy. Beaconsfield House was active during extreme weather events last year, providing community members with somewhere to get a hot meal, a warm shower and to recharge their batteries and devices. This was very welcome for the many locals whose power was out in their homes for an extended period. Waterbridge Food Co-op at Gagebrook House has a fabulous social enterprise selling low-cost healthy food while providing retail and food-handling skills training. Zeehan Neighbourhood Centre runs Zee Coffee House; the coffee there is the best on the west coast, their claim. Last year the Neighbourhood Houses Tasmania conference was held at St Helens and Fingal Valley Houses and I had the pleasure of joining the closing morning tea at Fingal Valley House.

Now there is an amazing example of ripples of change if there ever was one. The town was in danger of losing its supermarket, so the Neighbourhood House took it over as a social enterprise. They also run a local history room.

At one house, a previous participant in the training program, which is delivered through the house, became a volunteer delivering the program and they are now studying nutrition science through the University of Tasmania. At one centre, a local woman living with disability has been supported to DJ for events for young people. She built her confidence so much that she became a childcare assistant working shifts at the centre.

Every day, every neighbourhood house brings people together to connect, learn and play. These moments have an enormous impact, creating special waves of change in their communities.

Next week, our houses will be holding special events and projects encouraging community members to join them in celebrating the power of small actions that lead to big impacts. Join the community BBQ at Beaconsfield House on Monday.

On Tuesday at Devonport Community House, you can pick up some free items in the drive: clothing, bedding, household goods and toys or grab a smoothie made on a smoothie bike. The community pizza night is on Wednesday at the Geeveston Community Centre, and there will be a lot more right around the state.

I take this opportunity to thank our wonderful neighbourhood houses, the talented and welcoming people who work in them, the volunteer boards that govern them, the volunteers who provide vital support, and the people there who make other community members feel like they are welcome and like they belong. Your individual and cumulative actions are making a huge difference in the lives of many Tasmanians. Thank you.


Agfest 2025

[5.11 p.m.]
Ms HOWLETT (Lyons - Minister for Primary Industries and Water) - Honourable Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about Agfest. Last week, many of us in this Chamber had the privilege of attending this wonderful day, which is a flagship event on many people's calendar, particularly in the agricultural sector. With over 55,000 patrons and almost 630 exhibitors, I would say the event is just going from strength to strength each year. As the Minister for Primary Industries and Water, I feel so proud when I walk around the site and see how vibrant our agriculture sector is. Agfest is owned and run by the volunteers of the Rural Youth Organisation of Tasmania. Rural Youth is an amazing organisation which provides a social avenue for our young rural people, but it is also a training ground for our future leaders in the agriculture sector.

I met with Amber Bramich, the current Rural Youth president, as well as Dylan Bellchambers, the current Agfest chairman. Dylan and Amber are fantastic examples of future leaders and their team this year hosted another spectacular event. I must say the weather was particularly incredible for the three days of Agfest as well.

I spent much of my time visiting stakeholders in the day-and-a-half that I was there. Dairy Tasmania gave me the opportunity to meet with many businesses in the dairy industry. Luke McNab and Alycia Jones along with their team organised a great exhibit, and it was a pleasure to spend time with them. 

I spent time with TasFarmers, who were site-sharing with organisations like the Country Women's Association. They certainly had some fantastic scones in that tent. Hagley School Farm and Primary Employers Tasmania were there also. I took the opportunity with Ian Sawyer and Nathan Calman to launch the Tasmanian Red Meat Industry Strategic Plan, which was completed with a grant from our Strategic Industry Partnership Program.

I spent time with Professor Michael Rose, the Director of the Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture (TIA). The research undertaken by TIA is invaluable to the industry and helps progress towards AgriVision 2050 goal of $10 billion by 2050.

It was wonderful to spend time with Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania (NRE Tas). I also must admit, Biosecurity had a huge amount of people around their site talking to our little four-legged sniffer dogs who keep our borders so very safe from pests and diseases, and they were loving all the attention. In my racing portfolio, Tasracing had a stand there. They had both canine and equine displays there as well, and were showcasing GAP rehoming programs as well as off the track.

Agfest is always a special opportunity to celebrate and share what all of these industries have to offer. It is always particularly hard, as you have found as well, walking around Agfest without bumping into old friends. There were so many familiar faces from right around the state as well as the islands too. I loved every minute of it.

It was also great to see people from the Heart Foundation and the Menzies Centre there, who we know do such a terrific job. The Heart Foundation were taking blood pressure. It was good to see them have such a presence there, because the Heart Foundation and the Menzies Centre do such an incredible job.
We had many small businesses there as well, like Ashgrove and Bream Creek Dairy, and many of our catering hospitality businesses were showcasing food there as well.

I want to say thank you to Rural Youth Tasmania for once again organising such a stellar event. Your volunteers and what you do to make this three-day event go from strength to strength every year are incredible. Thank you so much and we look forward to returning next year.


Landcare Groups

[5.16 p.m.]
Ms BURNET (Clark) - Honourable Speaker, tonight I would like to talk about the value of organisations such as Landcare and the value, so important to our busy lives, of connecting with nature.

Last week, I had the pleasure of meeting with Tanya Scharaschkin from the Friends of Collinsvale landcare group. Tanya is a talented artist and botanist, and engages with the local primary school to teach students about nature, science and the importance of looking after the natural world. She is involved with landcare up in Collinsvale.

Tanya took us for a walk through the local Collinsvale bushland reserve. Not only did we go for a walk and hear about the conservation values of the area, but Tanya introduced us to the concept of nature journaling. We sat, listened to our surroundings, drew our breath, then took in our surrounds, whether the larger landscape of the amphitheatre of the Collinsvale area, that valley we were visiting, or the miniscule of smaller plants, or even mapping a soundscape. It was great just to sit and listen and enjoy hearing the black cockatoos eating the pine cones close by.

What struck me about this journaling was the ability to slow down. In today's world, we are always so busy. This is something particularly true for many in a busy life, with the world events as they are, with the war in Gaza as Mr Garland talked to us about yesterday in this Chamber. It is easy to be drawn into the minutiae of our lives that we forget to engage with the world that sustains us. In a world increasingly impacted by climate crisis, the need to connect to nature is more important than ever. For thousands of years, humans have been custodians of nature, caring for it and, in doing so, caring for ourselves. We have often lost touch with this.

This is why organisations such as Landcare are so important. Landcare Tasmania started in 1994 and since then has grown to over 300 community groups and over 5000 volunteers. As a Clark MP, I have spent a significant amount of time connecting with landcare groups, particularly in the northern suburbs. I have also had a long history through my work as a local representative on Hobart City Council with bushcare groups on this side of the Newtown Rivulet, or actually part of the Newtown Rivulet.

One such organisation is South Hobart Bushcare, who have been working on restoring bushland in Wellesley Park for over 20 years, and the New Town Rivulet Platypus Landcare Group who, inspired by the work to save the South Hobart Platypus, advocates for the protection of the Newtown Rivulet Platypus by removing litter and clearing up waterways.

Since starting in 1994, Clark now boasts nearly 30 landcare groups all organised by local people and all reflecting the local values of the area. There is the Moonah Nature Mates group who have been planting trees at Jim Bacon Reserve to revitalise the landscape and improve carbon storage, and the Claremont Coast Care group, which looks after the wetlands that stretch from MONA through to Austins Ferry.

There have also been amazing efforts to remove boxthorn, blackberries and other invasive species across the electorate by a group of volunteers who work with Glenorchy City Council staff. I have been involved with that great group of volunteers at Prince of Wales Bay, taking out a lot of boxthorn and then turning it into biochar. I might add that the Tasmanian University enviro group, on Saturday 4 May, will be doing a marine clean up at Prince of Wales Bay between 10.00 a.m. and 12.00 p.m.

It is a chance to connect, honourable Speaker. It is very important for our mental health and wellbeing, as Ms Rosol said yesterday. Connecting to nature is a good way to stave off depression and improve mental health.

The House adjourned at 5.21 p.m.
